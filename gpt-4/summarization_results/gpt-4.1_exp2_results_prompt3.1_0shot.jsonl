He reports that it \nfelt as though the food was \"building up\" in him and he began to \nhave reflux.

More recently he had a gastric emptying \nstudy which he says showed only 13% passed through in 2hrs. \nBecause he is so cacechtic and can only keep down liquids (solid \nfood causes chest pressure and pain rising from his lower \nabdomen), his PCP wanted him admitted for TPN and further work \nup.

An outpatient work-up \nhad been in progress; however, patient reported that his primary \ncare physician was concerned that more agressive intervention \n(possibly TPN) would be necessary. Review of patient's outside \nrecords revealed an extensive work-up including EGD, biopsy, \nenteroscopy, colonoscopy, CT, MRI, fecal fat studies, ___, \nlactoferrin, fatty acids, and basic metabolic panels were all \nnormal. The only abnormal result from outside facilities had \nbeen a gastric emptying study reported as having 13% emptying in \na 90 minutes period. At ___, nutrition and gastroenterology \nwere consulted. Nutrition consult recommended oral feeding with \nsupplementation with Ensure. They also requested a calorie count \nto be initiated; however, this was unrevealing prior to \npatient's discharge as the calories for only a couple of meals \nwere counted. Gastroenterology in consult felt that the patient \ndeserved a completion of his work-up of gastric and bowel \nmotility prior to further consideration of TPN. Another \ncomplicating issue about TPN is that the patient did not meet \ninsurance requirements to be initiated on TPN. Gastroenterology \nalso felt that medical management had not been exhausted as the \npatient had not been on antiemetics other than a short course of \nmetoclopramide. Also, the patient had never tried erythromycin \nfor motility. Gastroenterolopgy also raised the possibility that \nthis could represent a functional disorder. Patient was \ndischarged with intention of completing outpatient work-up to \ninvestigate a motility disorder prior to further consideration \nof enteral vs. parenteral feedings. Patien was set up to have \ngastric emptying study on ___ to be followed by an \noutpatient appointment with Gastroenterology. Of note, while \npatient was hospitalized, he had multiple lab studies including \nUPEP and SPEP  which were unrevealing of etiology. Iron studies, \nb12, cholesterol, and TSH were normal. TBili was slightly \nelevated consistent with diagnosis of ___. Vit-D and \nCarotene were pending at time of discharge.\n\n# Constipation:\nChronic issue for patient. Was discharged on colace and senna.\n\n# GERD:\nSome of patient's described sensation when eating solid food \ncould be attributed to GERD.

Retained stone was ruled \nout given normal LFTs and normal MRCP.  SMA syndrome was under \nconsideration since the patient had lost weight over the past \ncouple months and endorsed post-feeding pain.  However, CT scan \nand MRCP findings were not consistent with this diagnosis.  \nCeliac sprue was also entertained given nausea, vomiting, and \nweight loss with abdominal pain but TTG-Ab were negative.  ___ \n___ syndrome was also considered in etiology for RUQ and \npelvic exam was done that showed no cervical motion tenderness; \nGC and chlamydia were negative.  Ultimately it was thought that \nher right upper quadrant pain was likely secondary to muscle \nstrain in the setting of repeated vomiting; the vomiting was \nthought to be due to uncontrolled gastoparesis as well as a \ncomponent of anxiety.  Was given Ibuprofen with some resolution \nof her pain.  To continue treatment of her gastroparesis, she \nwas advised to eat smaller meals, avoid fatty foods, and \nmaintain good control of her sugars.

After a brief, \nuneventful stay in the PACU, the patient arrived on the floor \nwith an NGT, on IV fluids, and PCA for pain control.  The \npatient was hemodynamically stable.\n\nPOD3, the patient was passing flatus. The NGT was removed and \ndiet was advanced. POD4, the patient was transitioned to oral \npain medicine. POD5 the patient was having bowel movements but \nwas also increasingly distended and having poorly controlled \npain management. POD7 the patient had emesis and was backed down \nto NPO with IV fluids. Abdominal x-ray was consistent with \nileus. POD8 the patient had more emesis, distention, and WBC \nbumped up to 13.7. NGT was replaced with large amount of bilious \noutput. CT abdomen / pelvis was obtained which showed \npostoperative ileus. There was no recurrence of obstruction. \nPOD10, the patient was given oral contrast down his NGT. An \nabdominal x-ray eight hours after administration of oral \ncontrast showed contrast in the rectum. POD11, the patient was \nhaving bowel function. The NGT was removed and the patient was \nagain given clear liquids which were advanced to regular food \nwith good tolerability. \n\nWhen tolerating a diet, the patient was converted to oral pain \nmedication with continued good effect. The patient voided \nwithout problem. During this hospitalization, the patient \nambulated early and frequently, was adherent with respiratory \ntoilet and incentive spirometry, and actively participated in \nthe plan of care. The patient received subcutaneous heparin and \nvenodyne boots were used during this stay.\n\nAt the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile \nwith stable vital signs.  The patient was tolerating a regular \ndiet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, having bowel \nmovements, and pain was well controlled on tylenol.  The patient \nwas discharged home without services. The patient received \ndischarge teaching and follow-up instructions with understanding \nverbalized and agreement with the discharge plan.\n\n \nMedications on Admission:\nnone\n \nDischarge Medications:\n1.

Following the exploratory laparotomy and lysis of adhesions, you had a brief stay in the PACU and were then managed on the floor with NGT, IV fluids, and pain control. Despite some postoperative complications like ileus and emesis, you gradually improved, passed flatus, and resumed normal bowel function. By the time of discharge, you were stable, tolerating a regular diet, ambulating independently, and your pain was well managed with oral medication. You were discharged home with instructions for follow-up care."}
