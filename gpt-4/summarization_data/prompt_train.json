The pain was also associated with \"gaspy\" \ndyspnea which is different in character from the dyspnea he was \nrecently admitted with in the setting of his acute-on-chronic \ncongestive heart failure. He had some nausea, no vomiting, no \nsweating, no jaw radiation, no pleurisy, no alleviation of \ndyspnea with change in position. He took Dilaudid 2x with no \nrelief. He also noted increased leg swelling and thinks his L \nleg is more swollen than the R. He had no leg pain, and no \npersonal or family history of deep vein thrombosis.\n.\nHe denied chills, fevers, coughing, sputum production. \n.\nVitals in the ED were 97.9 81 128\/58 18 99%. Initial labs showed \nWBC of 28.6 with 96% PMNs, HCO3 of 21, and Cr of 3.8. BNP 18872. \nFirst set of troponins was negative.

Likely pulmonary metastases.\n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nThe patient is a ___ with multiple comorbidities who was \ndischarged from ___ yesterday following admission for \nacute-on-chronic congestive heart failure and acute-on-chronic \nkidney disease, now re-presenting with new chest pain and \nchanged dyspnea concerning for health care associated pneumonia.\n.\nACTIVE ISSUES:\n.\n# Dyspnea: The patient had multiple risk factors for acute \ncoronary syndrome (known coronary artery disease, previous \nmyocardial infarction, hypertension, diabetes), multiple risk \nfactors for pulmonary embolism (status post recent \nhospitalization, possible hypercoagulable state secondary to \nprobably malignancy), and was at risk for health care associated \npneumonia (given his recent hospitalization). The most likely \netiology for his new dyspnea and chest pain was health care \nassociated pneumonia, as he had an acutely worsened \nleukocytosis, a new neutrophilia, and highly suggestive findings \non x-ray, and a recent hospital stay. However, he had had no \nfevers, no chills, no cough, and no sputum production. Also on \nthe differential was acute coronary syndrome (given his risk \nfactors and his description of the pain, though unlikely given \nclear findings of pneumonia on chest xray and a negative first \nset of troponins. EKG was less helpful in the setting of paced \nrhythm). Pulmonary embolism was also a possibility given that he \nhad a recent hospitalization during which he was less mobile \nthan at baseline and given his probable malignancy. His \ndescription of sudden onset chest pain and dyspnea and history \nof left leg swelling was also concerning for pulmonary embolism. \nHowever, he was not hypoxemic or tachycardic and since the chest \nx-ray was so suggestive of pneumonia there was another \nexplanation for his symptoms.  Treatment was begun with \nlevofloxacin.  Legionella urine antigen was sent and was \nnegative. The patient's dyspnea did not recur during \nhospitalization and he was sent home on levofloxacin for total \n8-day course.  The patient will follow up with his primary care \nprovider upon discharge.\n.\n# Chest pain: Given the patient's description of acute onset \nchest pain with squeezing pressure, sweating, and radiation to \nthe left arm, another set of cardiac biomarkers was sent to rule \nout myocardial infarction. No changes suggestive of ischemia \nwere seen on initial EKG, however in the setting of the \npatient's paced rhythm the EKG was difficult to interpret.  On \nDay 2 of hospitalization, the second set of biomarkers showed a \ntroponin level of 0.47, consistent with non-ST elevation \nmyocardial infarction. The patient's chest pain had resolved so \nno morphine was given; he was already on his home beta blocker.  \nHe was started on daily aspirin.  He was not put on a heparin \ndrip due to his history of massive retroperitoneal bleed from a \nruptured renal cyst.  Serial cardiac enzymes were sent and \nshowed a peak troponin level of 0.66 and CK-MB level of 38, both \nof which were trending down at the time of discharge.  The \npatient had no further recurrence of his chest pain during the \ncourse of his hospitalization and he was sent home on a regimen \nof daily aspirin.\n.\n# Acute hematocrit drop: On Day 2 of admission, the patient's \nHct was 30.4, down from 35 the day prior.  He had no symptoms of \nbleeding and vital signs remained within normal limits.  He was \ntyped and screened and consented for a blood transfusion.  \nRepeat labs showed a stable hematocrit and no transfusion was \nnecessary. He was discharged home with a plan to maintain his \ncurrent weekly Hct checks which he gets for his epoeitin \ntreatments.  \n.\nINACTIVE ISSUES:\n. \n#. Lung nodules\/pleural thickening: Based on CT scan read, \nnodules are most likely malignant, and the patient has 40 pack \nyear smoking history and previous asbestos exposure. Nodules are \nunlikely to be contributing to respiratory issues but may be \ncontributing to appetitie loss and weight loss.  Outpatient \npleural biopsy is planned for ___.\n \n#. Chronic systolic congestive heart failure: Given the \npatient's recent hospitalization for acute-on-chronic CHF in the \nsetting of acute-on-chronic renal failure, and his remaining \nmild crackles and edema on initial exam, he was monitored \nclosely for need for more diuresis and furosemide was titrated \naccordingly with good response.  He was discharged home on his \nusual home dose of furosemide.\n.\n# Chronic renal failure: The patient was maintained on a \nlow-potassium, low-phosphate, fluid-restricted diet and diuresis \nwith furosemide was titrated based on daily fluid balance.\n.  \n# Abdominal pain: The patient has noted several weeks of \nintermittent right lower quadrant\/flank\/inguinal pain. Concern \nfor acute intraabdominal process was low given benign abdominal \nexam and recent negative abdominal CT scan. The differential \nincludes muscle strain or muscle spasm (pain seems to improve \nwith movement so stiffness may be contributing to his \ndiscomfort, though range of motion is full and does not \nexacerbate pain) or neuropathic pain (pain is described as raw \nand burning, intermittent with duration of minutes, and \nalleviated by changes in position which is consistent with an \nintermittent nerve entrapment etiology). The patient's pain \nremained well controlled on hydromophone as needed during his \nhospitalization, but he may benefit from treatment for \nneuropathic pain on an outpatient basis.\n.\n#. Diabetes: The patient's home glargine was continued with an \ninsulin sliding scale.  \n.  \n#. Hyperlipidemia: The patient's home statin was continued.    \n.  \n#. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's home metoprolol and \namiodarone were continued. THe patient was off coumadin and \naspirin since his renal hemorrhage.  Given his likely non-ST \nelevation myocaridal infarction just prior to this admission, it \nwas decided in consultation with his primary care provider to \nplace him back on daily aspirin at a dose of 162mg per day.  \n.  \n# Hypertension: The patient's home metoprolol\/isosorbide were \ncontinued with holding parameters for low BP.  The patient's ___ \nwas discontinued on previous admission in the setting of \nhyperkalemia to 5.9. The patient remained normotensive \nthroughout his hospitalization.  \n.  \n# Hypothyroid: The patinet's home levothyroxine was continued.  \n.  \n# Gout: The patient's home allopurinol was continued. \nTRANSITION OF CARE:\nPending results: blood cultures\nFollow-up appointments:\nDepartment: ___- ADULT MED\nWhen: ___ at 11:30 AM\nWith: ___\nBuilding: ___\nCampus: ___ Best Parking: ___\n*This is a follow up appointment of your hospitalization and \nwill be reconnected with your primary care physician after this \nvisit.\n.\nDeparment: RADIOLOGY \nWhen: ___ at 9:00AM \nWHERE: XCT ROOM 5 ___ \n___, ___ FLOOR \n*This is your appointment for biopsy of the outer lining of your \nlung.

Large area of right perihilar \nopacity likely relates to the patient's known underlying \nmalignancy, although superimposed infectious process is \ndifficult to exclude. The left lung is clear. SVC and IVC \nfilters are noted. \n\nCTA Chest ___:\nCT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: A right paratracheal lymph \nnode measures \n1.2 cm in short axis and is stable. There is a filling defect in \nthe left \nsubclavian vein. This is also unchanged. A filter is seen in the \nSVC. Distal to the SVC, there is no evidence of clot. The right \npleural effusion is significantly increased in size and is now \nlarge. There is a new left pleural effusion. There is a new \npericardial effusion of moderate size. There is now \nnear-complete atelectasis of the right upper lobe with some \npatchy opacities likely due to post-obstructive pneumonia. There \nis complete atelectasis of the right middle lobe. The right \nlower lobe is still aerated with some minimal atelectasis. The \ntumor in the right upper lobe is slightly increased in size, \ncurrently measuring 2.0 x 1.9 cm (previously 1.9 x 1.5 cm). \nThere is some atelectasis in the lingula. No new lesions are \nseen in the aerated portions of the lungs; however, please note \nthat the previously identified rounded foci in the right upper \nlobe and right middle lobe are now obscured by atelectasis. \nThere is a small filling defect in a subsegmental artery to the \nleft lower lobe (series 3, ___ 51 through 54). The most proximal \nportions of the liver and spleen that are depicted on this \nexamination are unremarkable. The thyroid gland is enlarged and \nthis is stable. \n  \nOn bone windows, there are no concerning osteolytic or \nosteosclerotic lesions. \n  \nIMPRESSION: \n1. Increase in size of right pleural effusion which is now large \nand new left pleural effusion, small to moderate in size. New \nmoderate size pericardial effusion. \n2. Subsegmental PE in an artery to the left lower lobe. \n3. New right upper lobe and right middle lobe collapse. Bronchi \nto the right upper lobe are increasingly obstructed.  \n4. Stable filling defects in the left brachiocephalic vein. \n5. Slight increase in right paratracheal lymphadenopathy as well \nas mass in the right upper lobe. Please note that the known \nright supraclavicular lymph node metastasis is not depicted in \nits entirety on this examination.  \n6. Due to new atelectasis and pleural effusion previously seen \nlung nodules are obscured. \n\nLeft UE ultrasound ___:\nFINDINGS: Grayscale and color ultrasound examination was \nperformed on the \nleft upper extremity. The left brachial, axillary and subclavian \nveins are \ncompressible, show normal wall-to-wall filling and phasic flow. \nThe left \ncephalic and basilic veins are normally compressible and show \nnormal Doppler waveforms. The left internal jugular vein is \ncompressible and shows normal color flow and Doppler waveforms. \nMinimal residual nonocclusive clot is seen in the lower left \ninternal jugular vein. Note is made of multiple enlarged, \nnecrotic-appearing left cervical lymph nodes as demonstrated on \nprior scans. \n  \nIMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT in the left upper extremity. \nPreviously seen \nleft internal jugular venous thrombosis appears to have \nresolved. Small \nnon-occlusive residual clot is seen in the lower IJ. \n\nCXR (Pa & Lat) ___:\nIMPRESSION: \n1. Persistent postobstructive right upper and right middle lobe \natelectasis likely secondary to centrally obstructing neoplasm. \n2. Enlarged cardiac silhouette consistent with known pericardial \neffusion. \n3. Persistent pneumothorax with anterior hydropneumothorax \ncomponent on lateral radiograph \n\nInitial TTE ___:\nThe left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall \nthickness, cavity size and regional\/global systolic function are \nnormal (LVEF >55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall \nmotion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear \nstructurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic \nregurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally \nnormal. No mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery \nsystolic pressure could not be determined. There is a moderate \nsized, circumferential pericardial effusion measuring 1.4 to 2 \ncentimeters in greatest dimension at end diastole. There is \nbrief right atrial diastolic collapse. There is significant, \naccentuated respiratory variation in tricuspid valve inflows, \nconsistent with impaired ventricular filling. \n\nIMPRESSION: Moderate-sized, circumferential pericardial effusion \nwith echocardiographic evidence of tamponade (RA diastolic \ncollapse, respiratory variation on tricuspid valve inflows). \nSmall echodense region appreciated near RV apex which is \nconsistent with possible cellular debris (?hemorrhagic effusion \nin the setting of underlying malignancy versus shadow\/artifact \n(clips 58 and 60)). Normal left ventricular cavity size and wall \nthickness with near-hyperdynamic biventricular systolic \nfunction. No clinically significant valvular disease. \nIndeterminate pulmonary artery systolic pressures.\n\nTTE ___ done for monitoring of pericardial \neffusion.\n\nMost Recent TTE ___:\nConclusions  \nLeft ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global \nsystolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Left ventricular \nsystolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Right ventricular \nchamber size and free wall motion are normal. No aortic \nregurgitation is seen. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. \nThere is a very small pericardial effusion. The effusion is echo \ndense, consistent with blood, inflammation or other cellular \nelements. There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade. \n\nIMPRESSION: Very small echodense pericardial effusion without \nechocardiographic evidence of tamponade.\n \nPCXR ___:\nOne portable upright view. Comparison with the previous study of \n___. A moderate right pneumothorax and right upper and \nmiddle lobe atelectasis persists. The right lung base is \nelevated consistent with a subpulmonic effusion as before. The \nleft lung is expanded and clear. The heart and mediastinal \nstructures are unchanged. Superior and inferior vena caval \nfilters and a mediastinal drain remain in place. \nIMPRESSION: No significant change. \n\nRight UE ultrasound ___:\nFINDINGS:  \nOcclusive thrombus is noted within the right internal jugular \nvein. The included portions of the right subclavian vein are \nwidely patent. A PICC line is demonstrated coursing through the \nright brachial and axillary veins, which are widely patent. \nNonocclusive thrombus is seen in the right cephalic vein, and \nthe region of the antecubital fossa. \n  \nLimited evaluation of the left subclavian vein demonstrates \npatency of the vein with a normal waveform. \n  \nIMPRESSION: \n1. Occlusive thrombus identified in the right IJ vein. \n2. Nonocclusive thrombus seen in the right cephalic vein. \n\nTTE ___:\nOverall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). \nRight ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. \nThere is a very small pericardial effusion. The effusion is echo \ndense, consistent with blood, inflammation or other cellular \nelements. There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.\n\nIMPRESSION: Very small echodense pericardial effusion without \ntamponade. \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nAssessment\/Plan:\nMrs. ___ is a ___ year-old woman with metastatic lung CA, \nrecurrent malignant pericardial effusion, recurrent DVT and PE \ns\/p IVC, SVC and brachiocephalic filter placement who presented \nwith cough and dyspnea for 1 week and was found to have CTA \nconcerning for PE and pericardial effusion with tamponade \nphysiology. She was taken semi-urgently to the catheterization \nlaboratory for pericardiocentesis with balloon pericardiotomy \nand subseqnetly required surgical creation of 2 pericardial \nwindows with internal drainage. \n. \n# Malignant Pericardial Effusion:  She presented with her third \noccurence of malignant pericardial effusion with evidence of \ntamonade physiology that required drainage and balloon \npericardiotomy. 240ml of sanguineous fluid was drained from \npericardial sac and she tolerated the procedure well. A \npericardial drain was left in overnight but removed the next \nafternoon when it had drained very little overnight. However, \nlater that day she again was noted to have an increased pulsus \nup to 32mmHg with doppler with recurrence of tamonade physiology \nwith new RV collapse on bedside ECHO. Overnight she was urgently \ntaken to CT surgery for pericardial window with internal \ndrainage. In that surgery window was created draining into the L \npleural space and a L chest tube was placed that initially \ndrained 400cc of serosanguinous fluid. Due to technical \ndifficulties with window placement and concern that the window \nmight not be effective, a pericardial incision was also made \njust righ of midline and 200cc of bloody fluid was drained from \nthe pericardium and a pericardial drain was placed in that \nincision. Pt was intubated for the proceedure and kept intubated \novernight as a precaution, but was extubated without incident \nthe next day. After 24hrs the L chest tube was removed as it had \ndecreasing drainage but the pericardial drain was left in place \ndue to very high output (1L over first 24hrs and 500cc\/day each \nof the following 2 days). Pt also received 1 unit PRBC on ___ \nas her Hct had drifted down to 22.4. There was concern that the \nwindow might not function when the pericardial drain was removed \nand the pt might go back into tamponade. As a result, the \npericardial tube was clamped on ___ and the patient was \nmonitored overnight without significant change in vital signs or \nsymptoms. On ___ interventional pulmonology placed a pleurx \ncatheter in the L pleural space and roughly 350cc was drained \nfrom the pleurx. On ___, the pericardial drain was removed \nafter ECHO confirmed that there was constrictive physiology but \nno hemodynamically significant effusion 36hrs after the tube had \nbeen clamped. Although the initial plan was to drain every other \nday, the pleurx was also drained on the ___ due to significant \nweeping on the dressing where the pericardial drain had been in \nplace. An additional 200cc of fluid was drained at that time \nwith process stopped as pt started to experience pain.  On the \nfloor, another 150mL of fluid was drained from pleurx which \nagain was terminated due to pain. Prior to discharge, she was \ndrained one last time.  She was given morphine po for these \ndrainages.  She was discharged with follow-up at IP and with ___ \nservices as well as prescription for morhine for continued \ndrainages.  Pulsus remained stable at between 10 and 14mmHg for \nremainder of hospital stay.  Oxygen saturation remained low ___ \non room air and decreased to 88-89% with ambulation.  She was \ndischarged with home oxygen.  She was scheduled for outpatient \ncardiology follow-up with outpatient echocardiogram for \nmonitoring.  \n.\n# Pulmonary embolism: She was first diagnosed with a pulmonary \nembolism in ___ along with BUE clots. She received SVC and \nIVC filters and has been on chronic lovenox. She was found to \nhave an anti-factor Xa level of >2.0 consistent with therapeutic \nlevels. CTA on this admission identified a subsegmental PE in an \nartery to the left lower lobe. Because of the reaccumulation of \nher pericadial effusion with solid pericardial mass component, \nit was determined that the heparin drip should not be resumed \nimmedicately. From time of initial pericardial window, heparin \ngtt or other therapeutic anticoagulation was held until pt \ntransfered back to OMED service on ___.  Upon transfer to \nfloor, she was started back on heparin gtt and then transitioned \nto lovenox upon discharge.  \n.\n# R anterior\/apical pneumothorax: on ___, daily PCXR noted \nsmall apical R pneumothorax. This was confirmed by CXR Pa\/Lat \nwhich also noted small anterior component to R apical \npneumothorax. This finding was monitored with daily PCXR and \nfound to be stable over the next 6 days. Cause of this PTX most \nlikely related to significant R pleural effusion\/atelectasis due \nto underlying lung malignancy more than any of the operative \nproceedures that were done as none of them in theory should have \ninvolved the R lung pleura. However, with intubation and line \nplacement, iatrogenic PTX is on the differential.  \n.\n# Infectious Disease: No cultures were positive during CCU stay. \nAround time pt went to OR for pericardial window, she had \ndeveloped a temperature of 100 and was slightly more \ntachycardic. There was some concern for possible \npost-obstructive PNA in setting of known lung mass so initially \nstarted on vanco\/cefepime for this on ___ and also knowing that \npt would be going to OR and receiving operative instrumentation. \nAbx were stopped Am ___ after 48hrs when it became apparent \nthat there was no significant infectious process as the cause of \npts symptoms.\n.  \n# Metastatic lung adenocarcinoma: Adenocarcinoma of the lung was \ndiscovered in ___, metastatic to right temporal lobe and now \ns\/p stereotactic radiotherapy.  S\/P cisplatin and navelbine last \nTx ___. Pt was kept on prednisone at oncology request due to \nher brain mets. Neuro attending recommended that keppra be \nstopped. Upon transfer to oncology floor, she was started on \nchemotherapy with taxotere which she tolerated well.  She also \nhad 3 days of increased steroids (dexamethasone 8mg bid x 3 \ndays) at the time of chemotherapy and also received neupogen to \nincrease her counts after chemo.\n.\n# S\/P Cyberknife for brain metastasis: She was finishing a \ndecadron taper on admission.  She received increased doses at \n8mg bid x 3 days around the time of chemotherapy and was \ndischarged back on dexamethasone 2mg daily until she meets with \nher neuro-oncologist for the swelling around her neck secondary \nto SVC syndrome.  She also had Horner's syndrome with right eye \nptosis and anhidrosis. She will need an outpatient MRI head and \nC-spine for further evaluation of her horner syndrome.\n.\n# Access: Pt had known right upper extremity DVTs on admission \nwith swelling around right arm for which she had been on \nlovenox.  She received a right PICC at the ICU for access.  \nLater, on the floor, RUQ ultrasound revealed right IJ and right \ncephalic DVTs.  Left UE US had small non-occlusive residual clot \nis seen in the lower IJ. Discussion was held with surgery and IV \nnurse regarding ___ this right PICC given persistent DVTs.  \nHowever, pt had very poor access and it was not guaranteed that \naccess could be obtained in left arm given clot in left IJ as \nwell.  Thus, it was decided to continue to use right PICC while \npt was in house with close monitoring of right arm \ncircumference.  Right arm swelling remained stable.  Right PICC \nwas ___ upon discharge.

Admitted \nin ___ with supraclavicular lymph node lesion that had been \ngrowing for at least three months and is now causing erosion and \nworsening pain. Pt presents from clinic for expedited workup and \nsymptom management of pain and nausea\/vomiting. \n\nIn ___, CT scan showed 5.9 x 5.6 x 4.6 cm mass centered at the \nright clavicular head with muscular and bone erosion as well as \na obliteration of the right internal jugular vein and encasement \nof the right common carotid artery. ENT was consulted, and the \npatient underwent laryngoscopy which showed immobility of the \nright vocal cord, potentially related to her tumor. Oncology was \nconsulted, and recommended a biopsy and CT Torso for further \nevaluation. A CT torso revealed a right breast nodule (likely \nold) and thyroid nodules. She underwent a thyroid ultrasound, \nwhich showed an echogenic somewhat spongiform appearing nodule \nin the right isthmus measuring 1.8 x 1.3 \ncm and a heterogeneous, hypoechoic vascular nodule in the lower \npole of the left thyroid measuring 2.5 x 2.3 x 2.8 cm with areas \nof \npunctate increased echogenicity (biopsy deferred to outpatient \nsetting). An ___ biopsy of her mass was performed and \nrevealed moderately to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of \nunknown primary with cells with signet ring morphology and \nimmunohistochemistry positive for CK7 (diffuse), CK20 (patchy), \nand TTF-1 (rare cells). Pathology felt that the overall \nmorphology in immunophenotype were nonspecific as to the site of \norigin, but they favored an upper GI or pancreaticobiliary \nprimary, although spread from long thyroid salivary gland, \nbreast or gynecologic primary would be less likely, but remain \nin the differential diagnosis. She was noted to have a mass in \nthe right breast on exam and as an outpatient, she had \ndiagnostic imaging performed ___. Directed right breast \nUS showed a circumscribed hypoechoic mass measuring 1.7 x 1.7 x \n0.5 cm with internal vascularity and no dominant posterior \nfeatures at 12 o'clock 2 cm from the nipple. Mammogram was \nconsidered BI-RADS 4B and ultrasound-guided core biopsy of the \ndominant mass at 12 o'clock in the right breast was recommended, \nalthough breast imaging felt that it was unlikely to be the \nprimary. On ___, she had a PET scan, which showed a 5.6 \ncm FDG avid right supraclavicular mass as well as asymmetric FDG \nuptake in the left arytenoid possibly secondary to activity \nwithin the arytenoid itself or underlying ill-defined node. She \nalso had an FDG avid right paratracheal lymph node and a \nheterogeneous thyroid gland with low-level activity noted in the \nleft lobe for which ultrasound was recommended. The right breast \nlesion did not show any FDG avidity.\n\nSince discharge, she has had some progressive dyspnea on \nexertion, which she thinks is related to deconditioning, \nespecially if she is climbing the stairs. She has also noticed \nincreasing hoarseness of her voice over approximately the past \nweek, although she thinks food is going down okay.  She has had \nsignificant pain at the mass itself as well as in the right \nshoulder and upper back. She has been trying to control this \nwith oxycodone 10 mg, which she uses about twice daily. However, \npain control has been inadequate and she has suffered from \nnausea and vomiting secondary to opiates. For this, she has been \ntaking Zofran twice a day, and this has not been controlling her\nsymptoms. She has not been able to tolerate a lot of PO, but \nweight is stable from last admission on ___. She continues \nto have a chronic cough, which is mostly dry. \n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Denies fevers, chills, sweats, diarrhea, \nblack stools, leg swelling or redness.  She does have an area of \nnumbness in the C5 distribution on her right forearm as well as \npain in the entire right arm at times, which is relieved by \nputting the arm in a dependent position.  No symptoms of \nlightheadedness and no pain in the right side of her face or \nfacial flushing. \n\n \nPast Medical History:\nPt admitted on ___ with bleeding right supraclavicular \nlesion. CT neck ___ showed 5.9 x 5.6 x 4.6 cm mass centered \nat the right clavicular head with muscular and bone erosion as \nwell as a obliteration of the right internal jugular vein and \nencasement of the right common carotid artery. ENT was \nconsulted, and the patient underwent laryngoscopy which showed \nimmobility of the right vocal cord, potentially related to her \ntumor. Oncology was consulted, and recommended a biopsy and CT \nTorso for further evaluation. CT C\/A\/P ___ revealed a right \nbreast nodule (likely old) and thyroid nodules. She underwent a \nthyroid ultrasound, which showed an echogenic somewhat \nspongiform appearing nodule in the right isthmus measuring 1.8 x \n1.3 cm and a heterogeneous, hypoechoic vascular nodule in the \nlower pole of the left thyroid measuring 2.5 x 2.3 x 2.8 cm with \nareas of punctate increased echogenicity (biopsy deferred to \noutpatient setting).\n\nSoft Tissue Core Biopsy ___:\nAdenocarcinoma, moderately to poorly differentiated.\nNote: The biopsy shows numerous tumor cells with cribriform, \nnested, and glandular architecture infiltrating fibrous tissue. \nScattered mucinous tumor cells with signet-ring morphology are \npresent. By immunohistochemistry, tumor cells show the following \nimmunophenotype:\n- Positive: CK7 (diffuse), CK20 (patchy), TTF-1 (rare cells).\n- Negative: CDX-2, Napsin A, thyroglobulin, GCDFP-15, \nmammaglobin, estrogen receptor,\nprogesterone receptor.\n- Equivocal: PAX-8 (weak and patchy nuclear staining).\nThe overall morphology and immunophenotype are not specific as \nto the site of origin. An upper gastrointestinal or \npancreaticobiliary primary is favored; spread from a lung, \nthyroid, salivary gland, breast, or gynecologic primary is less \nlikely but remain in the differential diagnosis.\n\nShe was noted to have a mass in the right breast on exam and as \nan outpatient, she had diagnostic imaging performed ___. \nDirected right breast US showed a circumscribed hypoechoic mass \nmeasuring 1.7 x 1.7 x 0.5 cm with internal vascularity and no \ndominant posterior features at 12 o'clock 2 cm from the nipple. \nMammogram was considered BI-RADS 4B and ultrasound-guided core \nbiopsy of the dominant mass at 12 o'clock in the right breast \nwas recommended, although breast imaging felt that it was \nunlikely to be the primary. On ___, she had a PET scan, \nwhich showed a 5.6 cm FDG avid right supraclavicular mass as \nwell as asymmetric FDG uptake in the left arytenoid possibly \nsecondary to activity within the arytenoid itself or underlying \nill-defined node.

Normal radial EUS of the stomach with no evidence to\nsuggest an infiltrative malignancy. Linear EUS was performed \nwith\nno evidence of a pancreas or biliary malignancy. \n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nMs. ___ is a ___ year old woman with carcinoma of unknown \nprimary. Admitted in ___ with supraclavicular lesion that had \nbeen growing for at least three months and is now causing \nerosion and worsening pain. Patient presented from clinic for \nexpedited workup and symptom management of pain and \nnausea\/vomiting. \n\n# Adenocarcinoma of Unknown Primary:\nOnly known site is R supraclavicular lesion. Biopsy with \nadenocarcinoma, signet ring cells raising concern for GI \nprimary. EGD and EUS without evidence of malignancy. PET scan \nwith increased uptake in L thyroid, R supraclavicular lesion, R \nparatracheal lymph node, left ileum. Patient also has R breast \nlesion without increased FDG uptake but without known primary \nand on ipsilateral side concerning for possible malignancy. Of \nnote, biopsy of supraclavicular mass negative for ER, PR, and \nHER2 (HER2 equivocal in biopsy staining but negative by FISH), \nso if breast malignancy were primary, would be triple negative. \nPt unable to lie flat for breast biopsy while inpatient and \ncould not be rescheduled for while the pt would still be \nin-house. Outpatient providers can consider ordering outpatient \nUS-guided breast core biopsy. While in-house, pt underwent FNA \nof left thyroid nodule, the results of which were pending on \ndischarge. \n\n# Right Supraclavicular Lesion:\nBiopsy consistent with adenocarcinoma, unknown primary as above. \nImmunohistochemistry positive for CK7 (diffuse), CK20 (patchy), \nTTF-1 (rare cells), CD117 (weak and patchy), p63 (rare), and \nCK5\/6 (rare). Pathology felt that the overall morphology in \nimmunophenotype were nonspecific as to the site of origin, but \nthey favored an upper GI or pancreaticobiliary primary, which \nwas r\/o with unremarkable EGD\/EUS. Given its size (5.6cm) and no \nobvious other primary source, it is most likely that the \nsupraclavicular mass is the primary cancer, most likely of a \nskin adnexal derivation. On admission, mass was causing patient \nsignificant right supraclavicular fossa pain and right \nshoulder\/upper back pain i\/s\/o large (approximately 6cm) mass in \nthe R supraclavicular fossa with extensive encasement \nof\/impingement on surrounding vascular and anatomic structures \nand with erosion through the skin. Pain likely due to brachial \nplexus nerve involvement, given C5\/C6 numbness and weakness on \nexam and neuropathic pain in arm (pins and needles).  Pain was \ncontrolled per pain consult recs with oxycontin 10mg q6am and \nq2pm, oxycontin 20mg q10pm, oxycodone 10mg q4h PRN, \nacetaminophen 650mg q6h, Tramadol 50mg q6h PRN, gabapentin 900mg \nTID, IV dilaudid 0.25-0.5mg q3h PRN for breakthrough pain. The \nulcerated supraclavicular fossa lesion was managed per wound \ncare consult recommendations. Five fractions of palliative \nradiation therapy were performed, session 1 ___ and \ncompleted on ___. \n\n# Nausea\/vomiting:\nOn admission, pt reported recent nausea\/vomiting at home that \nstarted after she began taking oxycodone for pain. Pt tolerating \nregular diet and weight stable from last admission on ___ \n(130 lbs). Albumin 4.2 on admission. No nausea\/vomiting while \nin-house except i\/s\/o motion sickness from being wheeled back \nfrom radiation. Motion sickness managed with Dramamine PRN prior \nto transport for procedures. Nausea\/vomiting controlled with PRN \nIV Zofran, PO Compazine, and PO Ativan while in-house, and pt \ndischarged with PO Zofran, Compazine, and Ativan PRN. \n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\n[] F\/u pending thyroid nodule FNA results\n[] Continue to titrate pain medications as needed for optimal \npain control\n[] Consider R breast mass biopsy if thyroid FNA results \nunremarkable \n\nCode Status: Full Code\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

Given the \npatient's history, followup of the patient in four weeks after \ncompletion of antibiotic therapy is required.  If finding is \npersistent, assessment with chest CT might be considered to \nexclude other potential etiologies for the lung abnormalities.\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ with BPD, CKD, neurogenic bladder, HTN, and recent allergic \ndermatitis presenting with fever and worsening skin lesions \ndespite antibiotics.\n \n# Skin lesions\/fever: Patient with history of chronically dry \nskin presenting with multiple MRSA+ abscesses over bialteral \nlegs, arms, and back.  Patient was afebrile during course of \nhospitalization and blood and urine cultures were not positive \nfor \ninfection.  Patient came in to the BI on dicloxacillin, which \nhad been prescribed by his dermatologist.  Dicloxacillin was \ndiscontinued and patient was given IV vancomycin x48 hours with \ngreat improvement of skin lesions.  For his pruritus, patient \nwas given sarna lotion and diphenhydramine with moderate effect. \n His dermatologist was contacted and recommended bleach baths \n3x\/week and mupirocin. Dermatology scheduled follow-up visit \nwith patient. Patient received an HIV test ___ concern for \nimmunocompromise in the setting of diffuse involvement.  One day \nprior to discharge, patient was transitioned to PO doxycycline \n(versus Bactrim, given CKD).  Patient tolerated this well, and \nwas discharged on a 14 day course of doxycycline. \n  \n# Dysuria: Patient has a ___ year history of neurogenic \nbladder which has been worked up extensively in the past, per \nthe patient.  Also documented history of BPH.  Patient has been \nself-cathing for the past ___ years and reports occasional \nUTIs.  On admission, patient reported recent dysuria and \nincreased frequency.  As patient had a CC of fever, UA and UCx \nwere obtained.  Both were negative.  Patient continued to \nself-cath during hospitalization without event\/complaint.\n\n# cough, SOB: Patient has extensive smoking history and may have \nmild COPD or other lung disease. CXR was obtained and was \nquestionable for infectious process in the lungs; however, \npatient improved subjectively without intervention.  No oxygen \nrequirement during hospitalization.  However, given \nabnormalities on CXR, it was recommended that patient have \nrepeat CXR in 4 weeks.\n\n# CKD: On admission, patient's creatinine elevated to 1.8.  He \nwas slightly tachycardic with increased BUN (although this \nappeared to be the patient's baseline).  Possibly volume down in \nsetting of decreased PO and increased urinary frequency.  \nBUN\/creat > 20.  Patient given 1L NS for possible prerenal \netiology.  Creatinine trended down to 1.5.  One day prior to \ndischarge, patient again with creatinine of 1.8 and was again \ngiven 1L NS.  Given patient's CKD, he was written for \ndoxycycline versus bactrim for continued treatment of his MRSA \nskin infection.  Medications, otherwise, were all renally dosed.\n\n# Bipolar disorder: Continued home meds.\n\n# Hemorrhoids: Continued home bowel regimen in addition to \nsenna, colace.  \n\n# HTN: Continued home meds.\n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\n# abnormal CXR:  Radiology suggested that patient, given h\/o \nsmoking and COPD, should receive repeat CXR in 4 weeks.  If CXR \nfindings persistent, assessment with CT recommended.\n\n# Continued bactroban and bleach baths given extent of MRSA \ninfection\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.
