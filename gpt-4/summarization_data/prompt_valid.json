In addition, there was prominent delta \nslowing broadly over the left hemisphere, suggestive of an \nadditional subcortical dysfunction there. Minimal slowing was \nevident on the right. There were no epileptiform features or \nelectrographic seizures. \n\nThis telemetry captured one pushbutton activation for an episode \n\nof confusion. There was no electrographic correlate. Otherwise, \nit showed \nprominent delta slowing over the left hemisphere suggestive of \nfocal cerebral dysfunction. In addition, the background was slow \nand disorganized throughout suggestive of a widespread \nencephalopathy which is non-specific with regard to etiology. \nThere were no epileptiform features or electrographic seizures. \n\nCT Head and Neck:\n1. No evidence for acute intracranial abnormalities on \nnoncontrast head CT.  \nNondiagnostic CT perfusion study due to technical factors. \n2. Multiple chronic infarcts are again seen in the right \nthalamus, left \ncaudate, and left  lentiform nucleus\/corona radiata\/external \ncapsule. \n3. No flow-limiting arterial stenosis in the neck. \n4. Unchanged atherosclerotic occlusion of the distal V4 segment \nof the non \ndominant right vertebral artery. \n5. Bronchiectasis in the visualized upper lungs with apparent \nnew bronchial \nwall thickening compared to ___, which may represent \nsuperimposed \ninfectious\/inflammatory process versus technical differences.  \nClinical \ncorrelation is recommended. \n6. Severe cervical spinal stenosis, previously assessed by MRI \nin ___. \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nMr. ___ is an ___ year old left handed man who presented with \nisolated global aphasia similar to a prior MRI-negative episode \nin ___ thought to be seizure vs stroke. \n\nInitially, given the exam and the identical nature of his \ncurrent aphasia to an MRI-negative spell in ___, seizure \nwas higher consideration than stroke. However, EEG showed no \nepileptiform activity.  It showed left greater than right \nslowing.  Previous EEG showed right greater than left slowing. \nHowever, due to the clinical suspicion for seizure, whether of \nunknown etiology or secondary to stroke, we have increased his \nKeppra 1000mg BID.  Although the initial CT was negative, an MRI \nshowed a small posterior insular cortex.  His stroke risk \nfactors have been assessed.  He is currnetly on Atorvastatin \n40mg qday.  His last LDL was 66.  He has afib and is currently \non Coumadin 2mg with theurapeutic INRs.  His INR on discharge \nwas 3.1.  His INR will continue to be trended by his primary \ncare doctor.  We were going to obtain an Echo since his last \nEcho was ___, however, the result will not change management.  \nHe will follow up with his outpatient Neurologist.   \n\nIn regards to pulmonary, Mr. ___ had some wheezing on inital \nexam that improved throughout the hospital course.  He had a CTA \nthat showed bronchiectasis visualized in the upper lungs with \napparent new bronchial wall thickening compared to ___, which may represent superimposed infectious\/inflammatory \nprocess.  Mr. ___ did endorse a recent viral illness.   \n\nAdditionally, Mr. ___ was found to have pancytopenia of unknown \netiology.  The pancytopenia improved over the course of the \nhospitalization.  He will follow up with his outpatient primary \ncare doctor.\n \nMedications on Admission:\n1. Warfarin 2 mg PO DAILY16 \n2. LeVETiracetam 750 mg PO BID \n3. Citalopram 20 mg PO DAILY \n4.

You had a similar episode in ___. At that time, the MRI of your brain was negative for stroke. However, this time, your MRI showed a stroke in the left side of your brain in a part called the temporal lobe. We have continued your blood thiner, Coumadin, to help prevent further strokes."}
