He was previously treated with \nivermectin empirically and responded, with an eosonophil \ndifferential that fell from 40% to approximately 10%.  However, \nthere was concern that the patient's mass may have represented a \ncarcinoma, and hence he was scheduled for a repeat colonoscopy \nto definitely evaluate the mass.  Because of his AVR, he was \nadmitted for bridging, though he may have not required admission \ngiven that his valve is aortic as opposed to mitral, and because \nhe has few risk factors, other than his valve, for \nthromboembolism.  The colonoscopy was performed without \ncomplications and the patient was found to have complete \nresolution of the mass--it was completely absent.  Biopsies were \ntaken nonetheless.  The patient was empirically treated with \nanother two week course of ivermectin because his eosinophil \ndifferential was still elevated.  He will follow up with the GI \nand ID clinics.\n  \n# AVR:  Patient was bridged with heparin and warfarin was \nrestarted after the colonoscopy.  After uncovering AHA\/ACC data \nthat supports the notion that patients with AVR and few risk \nfactors do not need a heparin bridge, the patient was d\/c'd on \njust warfarin and not lovenox.

Initially, we thought this might be your heart, however it appears that this was due to the heart failure regimen that you were on being over-aggressive. We gave you some fluids which improved your symptoms, and adjusted your medications slightly in order to stop this from happening again. In particular, we believe that the furosemide (lasix) and metolazone, which are medications that help remove fluid from your body were at too high a dose. In order to stop this from happening again, you should weigh yourself every day in order to help manage your fluid status."}
