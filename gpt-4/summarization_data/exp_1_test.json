The right atrium is markedly \ndilated. The estimated right atrial pressure is ___. Left \nventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular \ncavity size is normal. The left ventricular ejection fraction is \nmoderately depressed (35%) secondary to mechanical dyssynchrony \nas well as right ventricular-centric septal motion. There is no \nleft ventricular outflow obstruction at rest or with Valsalva. \nThe right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. The right \nventricular cavity is markedly dilated with severe global free \nwall hypokinesis. There is abnormal septal motion\/position \nconsistent with right ventricular pressure\/volume overload as \nwell as pacing-induced dyssynchrony. The aortic valve leaflets \nare moderately thickened. Significant aortic stenosis is present \n(not quantified; however, the reduction od aortic valve orifice \narea is severe and probably represents low flow\/low gradient \naortic stenosis). The mitral valve leaflets are mildly \nthickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. An eccentric, \nposteriorly directed jet of moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation \nis seen. Due to the eccentric nature of the regurgitant jet, its \nseverity may be significantly underestimated (Coanda effect). \nThe tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Severe [4+] \ntricuspid regurgitation is seen. [In the setting of at least \nmoderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, the estimated \npulmonary artery systolic pressure may be underestimated due to \na very high right atrial pressure.] The main pulmonary artery is \ndilated. The branch pulmonary arteries are dilated. There is no \npericardial effusion.\n.\nCompared with the findings of the prior report (images \nunavailable for review) of ___, the mitral and \ntricuspid regurgitation are increased, biventricular antegrade \nstroke volume is markedly reduced, and the low flow\/low gradient \nnature of the aortic stenosis is now evident. The right \nventricle is now significantly more dilated and hypocontractile. \n \n................................................\nCARDIAC CATHETERIZATION ___\nTechnical\nAnesthesia: Local\nSpecimens: none\nRHC via RFV, 7 ___ PWP\n.\nBlood Oximetry Information\nBaseline\nTimeSiteHgb (gm\/dL)Sat (%)\n10:02AMPA      10.10          50\n10:22AMART     10.10          93\n.\n100% O2\nTimeSiteHgb (gm\/dL)Sat (%)\n10:33AMART     10.10          100\n10:38AMPA      10.10          62\n10:44AMRA      10.10          67\n.\nCardiac Output Results\nPhase     C.O.

You did not loose a significant amount of blood and bleeding resolved. We noted that you have a urinary tract infection which we are treating with antibiotics. You will need to continue taking antibiotics for 2 more days after leaving the hospital. We noted that you had a large amount of fluid in your stomach and treated you with medication (furosemide and metolazone) to decrease this fluid. We examined your heart using an ultrasound and noted that your heart does not squeeze as hard as it did a few months ago which is related to heart failure. We performed a cardiac catheterization to evaluate your heart failure and concluded that you would best benefit from changing your pacemaker."}

If necessary, a CTA can be \nperformed for \nfurther assessment. \n2. Large, subcapsular hematoma    \n\nT-TUBE CHOLANGIO (POST-OP) ___\nIMPRESSION:  \n  \n1. Cholecystostomy tube is patent. \n2. Normal filling of the gallbladder, cystic duct, common \nhepatic duct and \nCBD. \n\n  \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nMr. ___ is a ___ man with history of CAD on plavix \nand ASA, PVD, and HTN with recent admission for mesenteric \nischemic s\/p SMA stent complicated acute cholecystitis s\/p \npercutaneous cholecystostomy and NSTEMI who presents with \nmelena.\n\n# GI Bleed: Patient was having melena per his rectal tube for \nthe last 1 day upon admission to hospital. Given melena concern \nfor upper GI bleed vs. slow lower GI bleed. Patient had known \nhistory of cirrhosis or varices. He was transferred to MICU for \nmonitoring, and had 2 superficial ulcers  found in the duodenal \nbulb which were clean based and not actively bleeding. Given \nhistory of mesenteric ischemia s\/p SMA stent, vascular surgery \nwas also consulted, who plannd for a duplex SMA on ___ which \nwas limited ___ patient unable to hold his breath during study.  \n Patient's blood count stabilized.  Patient's bleed was thought \nto have been provoked by plavix initiation after stent placement \nafter last hospitalization.  Plavix was discontinued this \nadmission after discussion with cardiology and family re:risks \nand benefits of plavix.\n\n# Acute Cholecystitis s\/p percutaneous cholecystostomy: During \nrecent admission had elevated WBC in setting of abdominal pain \nwith positive HIDA. On admission patient had no abdominal pain. \nLFT's and fever curve were trended in house, and given lack of \ninfectious symptoms, empiric antibiotics were not started. \nPatient was pan cultured on ___, which showed yeast on urine \nculture, and blood cx pending as of ___. Given uptrending \nLFT's and bilirubin, percutaneous cholecystostomy drain study \nwas ordered which showed patent cholecystostomy tube, and normal \nfilling of the gallbladder, cystic duct, common hepatic duct and \nCBD. Discussion with patient, family and surgery where it was \ndecided that patient would have his tube in place and bag \nchanged daily. Once output decreased to 50cc of fluid a day, can \nmake appointment with surgery to have this removed.  This was \ndecided with the family given the difficulty of transporting him \nfrom home.  The visiting hospice nurse with ___ the wound \nevery ___ days; dresssing changes with a drain sponge.\n\n# Leukocytosis: Persistently elevated since her previous \nadmission with a normal differential. No current signs or \nsymptoms of infection. Patient had ceftriaxone started ___ \nleukocyte positive U\/A on ___. Patient had 1 X blood cx on \n___ which did not grow out any organisms and urine culture \nsent on ___ which grew out yeast. Ceftriaxone was discontinued \non ___ after aforementioned urine culture result.   \n\n# Sterile pyuria: As above. UA with leuks and WBCs but negative \nnitrite likely in the setting of chronic indwelling foley. \nPatient denied any urinary symptoms on admission, likely \nrepresenting asymptomatic bacteruria. Foley was discontinued on \n___ and despite difficult foley removal, patient was \nvoiding well without any symptoms.\n\n# Elevated Troponin: Elevated on admission to 0.1, initially \nthough to be likely downtrending from his NSTEMI several weeks \nago which peaked to 1.68 on ___. Denied current chest pain \nand EKG with acute ST or T wave changes in house. Troponins were \ntrended in house, which initially held stable at 0.1. On ___ \nthe patient complained of chest pain. EKG showed new ST \ndepressions in inferolateral leads and troponin was .8. \nCardiology was consulted and it was noted patient was suffering \nnew NSTEMI. Per cardiology, the presentation was most consistent \nwith supply-demand mismatch due to anemia and compensatory \ntachycardia in the setting of fixed coronary artery disease. As \na result, patient was set with a transufsion goal hgb > 9, \nincreased to metoprolol 75mg TID.  Patient's troponins peaked in \nthe mid-3s and started to downtrend on ___.\n \n#GOC: Patient explicitly stated on the floor that he wanted to \ngo home and be comfortable and spend time with his family.  He \ndid not want any more interventions.  Patient's wife (HCP) and \nthe primary team agreed that patient was mentating well when \nexpressing these feelings and capable of making this decision.  \nAs a result palliative care were consulted and patient and \nfamily elected to go home with hospice.\n\n# Phantom Limb Pain secondary to right BKA: Continued cymbalta, \ngabapentin, oxycodone for pain in house.  Plan on discharge, per \npalliative care, was to taper the gabapentin as it was not \nhelping his pain.\n\n# CKD: Cr 1.3 on admission which appeared to be at baseline. \n\n# Severe Peripheral Vascular Disease: History right BKA, renal \nartery stenosis, carotid endarterectomy\/stenting and recent \nmesenteric ischemia s\/p SMA stent. Per vascular and cardiology \nrecommendations, as well as discussion with palliative care and \nthe family, held plavix and continued aspirin. \n\n# Hypertension: Given GI bleed, held home antihypertensives in \nhouse initially. With NSTEMI per above, started metoprolol 75 mg \nTID, and resumed imdur on ___.  \n\n# CAD s\/p CABG and NSTEMI: Per vascular recommendations, \ncontinued home ASA and held home plavix in house.  \n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\n- Plavix was held (discussion with family with regards to risks \nof being on plavix causing bleeding and not being on plavix \nwould put him at risk of stenosis of his stents, and family \nopted for not being on plavix), ASA 81mg was continued\n- He is being transitioned to home hospice\n- Please monitor perc cholecystostomy drain ouput and make \nappointment with surgery once drain output decreases to less \nthan 50ml of fluid\/day\n- patient's olanzapine was held in-house given liver function \nderangement, can consider restarting if needed\n\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

ST-T wave \nchanges in the inferolateral leads consistent with probable \nischemia. Compared to the previous tracing of ___ the \nfindings are similar. \n.\nCTA chest  (___):\nIMPRESSION:    \nRight lower lobe pleural-based lung mass with multiple bilateral \npulmonary nodules, one of which appears partially calcified. \nThere is also bilateral hilar and mediastinal adenopathy. \nFindings are concerning for primary lung neoplasm versus pleural \n\/ parenchymal based metastases. One of the nodules appears \npartly calcified and metastases from osteosarcoma or squamous \ncell primary should be considered. Further staging with CT \nabdomen and pelvis and\/or CT\/PET is recommended. No evidence for \npulmonary embolism or aortic dissection to account for chest \npain.  \n.\nECHO (___): \nThe left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left \nventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is \nnormal. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic \ndysfunction with inferior and infero-lateral hypokinesis. There \nis no ventricular septal defect.

The aortic valve \nleaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not \npresent. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve \nleaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate (___) mitral \nregurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly \nthickened. There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic \nhypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. \n.\nCardiac Cath (___):\nCOMMENTS:      \n1. Coronary angiography in this left dominant system revealed \ntwo vessel \ndisease. The LMCA was without angiographically apparent disease. \nThe LAD \nhad no significant disease. The LCx had 40% proximal stenosis \nand was \n100% occluded in the mid vessel. The RCA was non-dominant with \nmild \ndiffuse disease. \n2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed systemic arterial \nnormotension. \nFINAL DIAGNOSIS:     \n1. Two vessel coronary artery disease. \n2. Inferolateral STEMI with occluded mid LCx. \n3. Plavis 75 mg daily mandatory for 4 weeks, 3 months better, \nand 12 \nmonths best. \n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ yo M with several cardiac risk factors -smoking, age, but no \nknown CAD, presents with NSTEMI.\n.  \n# NSTEMI: Mr. ___ presented to the p\/w atypical chest pressure \nin the setting of emesis from excess ETOH consumption. On \npresentation to the ED, the plan was two sets of troponins and a \nstress test. His initial troponin was < .01. However, his second \ntroponin increased to 1.46. His EKG had no signs of ST \nelevations, but there were areas in the inferior-lateral leads \nthat were concerning for possible ischemia. He had a stool \nguaiac in the ED and was started on a heparin gtt. He was \ntransferred to the floor where he had no complaints of chest \npain. He was continued on a heparin gtt. He was started on \naspirin and loaded with plavix 600mg. His SBP remained low \nduring his hospital stay. We discontinued his home dose of \natenolol and switched him to metoprolol tid. However, the \npatient started to develop intermittent bradycardia (see below) \nand we had to decrease the dosing of metoprolol to 25mg bid. We \ndid not start him on a ACE inhibitor, given that his systolic \nblood pressures were in the low 100s. He remained \nhemodynamically stable until his cardiac catheterization on \n___. He was found to have a lesion in the mid-circumflex \nartery. A bare mental stent was placed and restored normal flow \nthrough the artery. He did complain of numbness and tingling in \nthe left arm after the cath. He had repeat EKGs that were \nunchanged from previous EKGs. The patient was ready for \ndischarge on ___. He was informed about the importance of \ncontinuing aspirin and plavix to prevent stenosis of the bare \nmetal stent placed. I discussed the events of his \nhospitalization with his primary care physician. He was \nscheduled for a follow-up with a cardiologist in 1 to 2 weeks \nafter his discharge. \n.  \n# Intermittent bradycardia: Pt. has had several episodes of \nasymptomatic bradycardia. He was alternating between Mobitz type \nI and II on ___. EP was consulted and were concerned that \nhe had a higher degree AV block. They felt that his bradycardia \nwas exacerbated by ischemia and did not feel that a pacemaker \nwas warranted. They felt that the bradycardia should resolve \nonce he had the cath completed. \n.\n# PUMP: no known history of CHF, but had an elevated JVP on \npresentation. The patient had an ECHO completed on ___ that \nrevealed that he had a moderate EF (45%) and hypokinesis in the \ninterior and inferior-lateral walls of the ventricle. He did not \nhave any evidence of heart failure during his hospitalization.\n.  \n# Lung nodules: The patient had a CT chest early in his \nadmission because there was concern that he had a pulmonary \nembolism or an aortic dissection. The CT scan  revealed no \nevidence of aortic dissection or pulmonary embolism. He did have \na 3cm right pleural based nodule w\/ multiple small nodules as \nwell as hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy concerning for \nmalignancy. Radiology recommended an abdominal\/pelvic CT scan or \na PET scan for staging. The CT scan was deferred during his \nhospitalization because he had received multiple dye loads \nwithin 48 hours of each other and there was concern for contrast \nnephropathy. Obviously, the pulmonary nodules were an incidental \nfinding and the patient is aware of the importance of close \nfollow-up to evaluate these nodules. Dr. ___ primary care \nphysician, was informed about the results of the study and a CT \nscan of the abdomen and pelvis was scheduled in 1 week after \ndischarge. \n.  \n# Diabetes: recent HA1c was 6.2. We completed fingersticks four \ntimes a day and had a sliding scale written as needed.  \n.  \n# HTN: His baseline blood pressure usually ranges between 130 to \n140. His SBP was significantly lower during his hospital stay. \nHis systolic blood pressures ranged between 90 and 112. He was \n.  \n# Glaucoma: He was continued on his home regimen of eye drops \n(Cosopt\/Travatan)  \n.  \n# ETOH abuse: The patient has an extensive history of alcohol \nabuse. During his hositalziation, he had no signs of withdrawal. \nHe was written for a CIWA scale and this was discontinued on \n___.    \n.\nPROPHYLAXIS:  \n-DVT ppx with heparin gtt -> SQ heparin after cath.\n-Pain management with tylenol  \n-Bowel regimen with senna\/colace  \n.  \nCODE: FULL  \n.\n \nMedications on Admission:\nASPIRIN - 325 MG TABLET (ENTERIC COATED) daily  \nATENOLOL - 50 mg Tablet - 1 Tablet(s) by mouth at bedtime  \nCYCLOBENZAPRINE - 10 mg Tablet q 8hrs prn  \nDORZOLAMIDE-TIMOLOL [COSOPT] - 0.5 %-2 % Drops - 1 gtt BID  \nIBUPROFEN - 600 mg Tablet - 1 Tablet(s) by mouth three times a  \nday as needed for pain take the medication with food.

Work up revealed evidence of \npachymeningitis of unclear cause and frequent electrographic \nseizures without clinical correlate. Seizures were controlled \nwith 4 AEDs and an empriric course of systemic steroids provided \nimprovement in the patient's mental status. \n\nOver the past month or so the patient has begun to have frequent \nperiods of nodding off and urinary incontinence. There was \nconcern for either medication toxicity or intermittent seizures \nand she was admitted for repeat imaging of the brain, continuous \nvideo EEG monitoring and possible titration of her AEDs. She was \nfound to have a UTI and is completed a course of antibiotics. \nHer symptoms of incontinence have resolved and her sleepiness is \nimproving.\n\n# CHRONIC UNCAL HERNIATION \/ PACHYMENINGITIS: Appears worse on \nrepeat MRI compared with prior. On exam she continues to be \nalert. She does have some cognitive deficits (can only name 5 \nwords that start with the letter \"s\" in 1 min). The etiology of \nher uncal herniation could be either secondary to increased \nintracranial pressure or low CSF pressure in the spine from an \noccult CSF leak. Fundoscopic exam did not reveal papilledema. \nThe pain service was consulted with a question of empiric blood \npatch but ultimately the procedure was deemed to risky because \nan accidental puncture of the dura could be fatal in the setting \nof increased intracranial pressure. Her workup for an etiology \nof her pachymeningitis including imaging to look for CSF leak, \nmalignancy workup, and rheumatologic workup was repeated and \nunrevealing. Concerns regarding her safety at home were raised \nand a family meeting was held to arrange a safe discharge plan. \n\n# SEIZURES: In the setting of chronic pachymeningitis and uncal \nherniation Ms. ___ has abnormal EEG findings. Although \nabnormal at baseline, her EEG did not show new abnormalities. \nShe was discharged on Keppra XR ___ daily, phenytoin BID, \nZonisamide 400mg qhs. She also continued primidone, folate, and \nher multivitamin. Her Seroquel was held in the setting of \nincreased sleepiness. \n\n# URINARY TRACT INFECTION: UA and urine culture revealed a \nurinary tract infection and she was treated for an uncomplicated \nUTI with 3 days of ceftriaxone. Likely this was the etiology of \nthe urinary incontinence and possibly waxing and waning mental \nstatus, both of which improved with treatment of her UTI.\n\n# PRURUTIS: Ms. ___ has chronic itching with a questionable \nhistory of scabies last hospitalization for which she was \nempirically treated. She had no rash on exam. Dermatology was \nconsulted and felt her itching is not consistent with scabies. \nIt improved with topical creams including Vaseline and sarna. \nSystemic illness including Hepatitis B and abnormal liver \nfunction were ruled out as well. \n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES\n- follow up in neurology clinic\n- elder services is following her outpatient regarding a safe \nhome plan\n- PET scan outpatient to rule out occult malignancy\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

Orthostatic hypotension: Pt found to be orthostatic. \nDifferential: volume depletion from combination of diovan and \nlasix, autonomic nueropathy, adrenal insuficiency (hypoglycemia, \nweakness, K+ on the high side of normal, abs eos #=400-500). Pt \nwas given several liters of IVF in the ED and still mildly \northostatic. Adrenal insuficiency was considered in setting of \nhypoglycemia, muscle weakness, K+ on the high end of normal, \nmild eosinophilia (abs eos=400-500). Morning cortisol was 3.3 \nand cosyntropin test bumped cortisol up to 28, 2 hrs later. ACTH \nstill pending. Given the normal results of this cosyntropin \ntest, it is unlikely that pt has primary adrenal insuficiency. \nHowever, secondary adrenal insuficiency still possible (although \nunlikely), pending ACTH results. Autonomic neuropathy was \nconsidered in pt with long standing diabetes and end organ \ninvolvement. However, EKG did reveal respiratory variation of RR \ninterval making this diagnosis less likely. Additionally, pt not \ntachycardic, which  is often seen in pts with autonomic \nneuropathy.\n-Pending ACTH results from ___ and ___\n.  \n#. Type 1 Diabetes\/Hypoglycemia: Last hemoglobin a1c 12.8. \nPatient reports episodes of am hypoglycemia last ___ weeks. \nHypoglycemia may be related to adrenal insufficiency. It is also \npossible that pt has antibodies to insulin (from being exposed \nto non-purified insulin several decades ago), causing the NPH to \nstay in her system longer (taking longer to clear), resulting in \nhypoglycemia. This, combined with recent poor PO intake, likely \ncontributed to her symptoms. Additionally, pt has limited Cr \nclearance, likely impairing secretion of insulin and \nsubsequently increasing basal rates. It is also possible that pt \nis not giving herself the accurate amount of insulin since she \nhas poor eye-sight. ___ followed pt during admission. Pt was \ngiven NPH 45U in the AM and will continue this regimen at home. \n(Her home prior regimen was NPH 60U in AM and 20 U in ___  \n.  \n#. Proximal muscle weakness: Pt reports proximal muscle \nweakness, however, she is ___ throughout on neuro exam. CK, TSH, \nLFTs, cortisol syntropin test all wnl. ESR 28 but normal CRP. Pt \ndenies jaw claudication or temporal headaches. Muscle weakness \nlikely ___ hypoglycemia.  Pt's insulin regimen was adjusted \ninhouse.\n.\n# Fall: Pt fell on ambulation from the bathroom to her bed. Fall \nwas secondary to poor eye site. Pt fell on her buttocks. Pt had \nno head trauma, no LOC. She did have some tenderness along \nligaments and muscles of spine. Pt told that this was likely \nmusculoskelet and not a fracture, and she was offered an X-ray \nbut pt declined. Pt had full range of motion. Pt was given \noxycodone and baclofen for pain and discomfort.\n.  \n#. UA positive for trace leuks: urine culture negative.  \n.  \n#. HTN: Initialy held lasix and diovan in setting of \northostasis. Both medicatiosn were reintroduced at lower \ndosages. She was given lasix 80mg every other day and diovan \n80mg daily.  \n.  \n#. Hypercholesterolemia: Continued statin and zetia  \n.  \n#. Glaucoma: Continued eye drops  \n.  \n#. Vitamin D\/B12 deficiency: Continue B12\/D  \n\nPENDING LABS:\n-ACTH from ___ and ___\n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\n-Full code\n-reccomend pt continue to get workup for her symptoms of \nhypoglycemia, weakness. ACTH results still pending. Pt might \nbenefit from repeat co-syntropin test and from checking \naldosterone. She had adequate response to co-syntropin, however \nmorning cortisol was low at 3.\n-Hypoglycemia: reccomend pt ultimately be switched to glargine \nfor long acting control. Pt declined during this \nhospitalization. Also reccomended that she start using the \ninsulin pen given her poor vision. Pt will follow up with \nendocrinologist.\n\n \nMedications on Admission:\n___ year old woman with longstanding Type 1 DM c\/b nephropathy, \nneuropathy, gastroparesis, and retinopathy here with labile \nblood sugars and ortostatic hypotension.  \n.  \n#. Orthostatic hypotension: Pt found to be orthostatic in the \nED. Differential: volume depletion from combo of diovan and \nlasix, autonomic nueropathy, adrenal insuficiency (hypoglycemia, \nweakness, K+ on the high side of normal, abs eos #=400-500). \nNormal electrolytes, especially normal sodium and lack of \nongoing hypotension, fever, abdominal pain argue against acute \nadrenal insufficiency. However, chronic primary or secondary \nadrenal insufficiency is possible given morning hypoglycemia, \nfatigue, and proximal muscle weakness.  \n- final results ___ stim test. It appears that cortisol: \n3.3-->29, but checking with lab since the timing of studies \nmight have been off.  \n- repeat orthostatics this AM  \n- ___ consult  \n- re-start lasix (80 every other day, per pt) and diovan (80) \nfor now  \n- If this is autonomic neuropathy and pt is disabled with \northostasis, would consider midodrine or fludrocortisone which \nwould likely exacerbate fluid retention if no improvement  \n- compression stockings  \n.  \n#. Type 1 Diabetes\/Hypoglycemia: Last hemoglobin a1c 12.8. \nPatient reports recent episodes of am hypoglycemia last ___ \nweeks. She recently had ED visit for hyperglycemia on ___ but \nstates this was secondary to attempts to increase PO intake \ngiven low am blood sugars. Hypoglycemia may be related to \nadrenal insufficiency and\/or hypoglycemia associated autonomic \nfailure or insulin excess.  \n- QID fingersticks with no bedtime coverage  \n- continue NPH 45 units qam per recent adjustment (home regimen: \n60 AM and 20 ___  \n.  \n#. Proximal muscle weakness: Pt reports proximal muscle \nweakness, however, she is ___ throughout on neuro exam. \nDifferential dx includes adrenal insufficiency or other \nendocrinopathy such as hypo\/hyperthroidism or deconditioning or \npolymyositis.  \n- check TSH, CK, LFTs, cortisol  \n- ___ consult  \n.  \n#. UA positive for trace leuks: Follow up urine cx, pt without \nurinary symptoms.  \n.  \n#. CRI: Cr 1.2 at baseline.  \n.  \n#. HTN: BP 160-170s overnight. Currently hypertensive while \nsupine but remains orthostatic.  \n- Hold lasix  \n- hold diovan for now but will likely need decreased dose of \ndiovan for renal protection and will order as 80mg prn SBP>180  \n-prior home regimen: lasix 80 every other day, diovan 200 and \n160 alternating days->160 daily.

Dental consultation is recommended. \n\nMRI head ___:\nIMPRESSION:   \n1. Evolving subacute infarcts in the splenium of the corpus \ncallosum and \nparietal lobe. \n2. Punctate focus of questionable restricted diffusion in the \nsuperior medial left thalamus, which may represent an acute \ninfarction versus artifact. Otherwise, no new large acute \ninfarct or mass effect. \n\nCarotid ultrasounds ___:\nIMPRESSION:  \n1.  Patent left ICA stent.  Mild homogeneous plaque in the left \nICA results in less than 40% stenosis.   \n2.  No right-sided carotid vasculature atherosclerotic disease. \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nPlease see previous discharge summary for details.\n\nIn summary, Mr. ___ returned for another recurrent episode of \naphasia\/dysarthria. An MRI showed a left thalamic infarct which \nwas new in the interim since prior admission, in addition to the \nknown left splenium infarct. This was also not felt to be \nexplaining his symptoms and felt to be an indication of ongoing \nthrombogenic physiology. Etiology of these recurrent \nTIAs\/strokes remained unknown. Coumadin was stopped as it was \nfelt to not be of additional utility. Platelet function and \nclopidogrel test was sent and suggested some degree of \nclopidogrel resistance. Per agreement with Vascular surgery and \nVascular medicine, decision was made to stop the clopidogrel and \nstart a trial of ticagrelor instead. A repeat swallow evaluation \nwas also performed to exclude risk of aspiration in setting of \npharyngeal\/laryngeal fibrosis from previous radiation therapy. \nTEE was attempted at the recommendation of Vascular medicine, \nhowever it was unsuccessful due to inability to pass probe \nthrough his oropharynx due to fibrosis- no further attempts were \nmade. He was fitted with a Zio patch cardiac monitor in attempt \nto capture any occult arrhythmia as a source of cardioemboli.\n\nAside from stopping Coumadin and clopidogrel, and starting \nticagrelor, no other medication changes were made. His \nneurologic examination at discharge was at baseline.\n\nTransitional issues:\n[ ] Please continue aspirin and ticagrelor indefinitely for \ncarotid artery stent and secondary stroke prevention.\n[ ] Please follow up results of Zio patch cardiac monitoring; if \nany cardiac arrhythmia found we strongly suggest starting \nsystemic anticoagulation (please consult with Stroke provider if \nthis is found).\n[ ] Stroke, Neurosurgery and Vascular Surgery followup arranged.\n[ ] Patient's home antihypertensives were all resumed with \nexception of metoprolol which was halved to 6.25mg BID. Please \ncontinue to monitor and titrate for a long term goal of \nnormotension.\n[ ] Continue atorvastatin for lipid-lowering therapy and obtain \nrepeat LDL in ___ months.

Found to be in Afib\/RVR and acute dCHF. Was given a couple \ndoses of IV lasix with rapid improvement, then kept on 40mg PO \nlasix (on 20mg at home) with stable creat, O2 sats, BP. Thought \nis that she has worsening of her chronic dCHF due to Afib rhythm \nand poor HR control. Initally rates were 100-110s, so her \nmetprolol was titrated up from 50mg BID to ___ QID (home on \n200mg bid). Rates still 90-100s, so digoxin added per cardiology \nconsult. Rates now ___ with dig on board and given her CKD, \nshe will be discharged on digoxin 0.125mg QOD. Appears from her \nchart that she was admitted with similar symptoms in ___ (dCHF \nin setting of afib) and spontaneously had converted and had been \nmostly sinus in her outpt follow up visits. Has been on amio as \noutpt per Dr. ___.  Given she is on amio, checked TSH to see \nif this was contributing to her conversion to Afib, and she was \nin fact, found to be hyperthyroid. Her synthroid dose was \nreduced. It was felt in past that she does better in sinus, but \ncardiology aggreed that we unlikley would be able to acheive \nsuccessful cardioversion while she is in hyperthyroid state and \nwe should instead focus on rate control. One concern is that \nonce she flips to NSR, dose of BB is quite high so she was \nwarned about sudden LH or weakness (check pulse). Her INR were \nborderline so her coumadin dose was slightly increased (2mg \n5days a week, 4mg TTh). Her Avapro dose was reduced 300 to 150 \nto allow titration of metoprolol. She did overall very well here \nwith improvement in her resp status. Her chest pain on admission \nwas likely due to acute pulm edema and resolved after diuresis \nand she was ruled out. She had one episode of confusion where \nshe did not know where she was. her vitals\/labs\/UA\/CXR\/CT ___ \nat the time were unremarkable and she improved by next morning. \nShe did well with ___. she will go home where her sister will \ncare for her for a few days and is searching for more around the \nclock care, though pt is otherwise very sharp and independent. \nShe will have CHF ___ and home ___.

No masses or thrombi are seen in the \nleft ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall \nmotion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear \nstructurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic \nstenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears \nstructurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is \nno mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure \ncould not be determined. There is a trivial\/physiologic \npericardial effusion. \n\nIMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with \nregional systolic dysfunction c\/w Takotsubo cardiomyopathy or \nmid-LAD lesion. \n.\nEchocardiogram \n___\n\nThe left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect is seen by \n2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure is ___ \nmmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left \nventricular cavity size is normal. There is moderate regional \nleft ventricular systolic dysfunction with mid to distal \nanterior, distal septal and apical akinesis and distal lateral \nhypokinesis. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left \nventricle. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right \nventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The \naortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic \nstenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The \nmitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral \nvalve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is \na small pericardial effusion. No right ventricular diastolic \ncollapse is seen. There is brief right atrial diastolic \ncollapse. \n\nCompared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, \nthe LVEF has decreased.\n.\nCardiac MR\n___ Pending at time of discharge \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ with no known cardiac history who had witnessed cardiac \narrest, s\/p resuscitation, with concern for LAD lesion, now \ntransferred from ___ ICU to ___ CCU for cardiac \ncatheterization.\n\n1. S\/p cardiac arrest: It was unclear how long pt was down \nbefore compressions started but he was in ventricular \nfibrillation and after being shocked, he returned to sinus tach \nwithin ten minutes.  Pt was not cooled because he was responsive \nand moving around by the time he reached ___.  Also, cooling \nprotocol had not been initiated at OSH and by time he reached BI \nhe was out of the window to start cooling.  On arrival he was \ntubed and sedated.  Pt was loaded with amio.  Over the next ___ \nhours, weaned off vent and pt responded appropriately.  He did \nnot have any other dangerous arrhythmias.  Etiology of vfib was \nmost likely secondary to ischemia.  EKG and Echo were concerned \nof mid-LAD lesion. Initially cardiac cath was performed and \nshowed that there appeared to have been a probable LAD territory \ninfarct\/thrombus that spontaneously resolved with medical \ntherapy.  EP was consulted and performed EP study, placed single \nchambe ICD with no complications.  A CMR was performed and \npreliminarily suggested some scaring but final read is still \npending at time of discharge.  It was rec f\/u with Dr. ___ \n___ from cognitive neurology at time of d\/c. He will need \nrepeat echo ___ wks after d\/c.\n.\nCardiomyopathy: Pt was previously healthy and now with depressed \nLV function with apical hypokinesis.  Most likely secondary to \nischemia, but concern given coronary arteriogram did not show \nany direct evidence occlusion.  Echo pattern was somewhat \nconsistent with takatsubo's.  Pt was started on metoprolol, \nlisinopril and coumadin (apical akinesis) at time of discharge.  \nHe was euvolemic without need for diuresis, so was not started \non lasix on discharge.  \n.\nSTE in lateral leads: Post cath, pt had persistent STE in \nlateral leads and he was asymptomatic.  CE were relatively flat \nwith exception of CK (but pt had rhabdo).  Concern for coronary \nvasospasm, so started on diltiazem drip, but this did not \nresolve to elevations.  Pt was re-cathed, but coronaries were \nclean.  Concern that these elevations are secondary to \nmyocarditis.  Labs were notable for mildly positive rheumatoid \nfactor, negative varicella and EBV.  At time of d\/c ___, viral \ncx and antimyocardial ab were all pending.  Pt was discharged on \nhome dose of asa and started on plavix 75.   \n.\nH. flu PNA: RML consilidation found post extubation.  Sputum cx \ngrew out h. flu and pt has not had prior vaccination.  He was \ntreated with azithromycin and ctx.  At time of d\/c he had two \nadditional days of ctx so was started on cefpodoxime to finish \nthe abx course.  \n.\n# Rhabdomyolysis: Thought to be secondary to amiodarone and \nAtorvastatin. Pt's CKs rose to >11K but kidney function remained \nnormal throughout.  He also had mild transaminitis.  With \naggressive fluid resuscitation, CK's trended down and were wnl \nby time of d\/c.

Left ventricular wall \nthickness, cavity size and regional\/global systolic function are \nnormal (LVEF >55%) Right ventricular chamber size and free wall \nmotion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The \naortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic \nstenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The \nmitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral \nregurgitation. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic \nhypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.\nIMPRESSION: Normal global and regional biventricular systolic \nfunction. Moderate pulmonary hypertension. \n.\nTTE (___):\nIMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with \npreserved global and regional biventricular systolic function. \nMild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Mild mitral \nregurgitation.\nCompared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, \nthe findings are similar. LVEF > 55%.\n..\nPATHOLOGY:\nBONE MARROW BIOPSY (___):\nACUTE MYELOID LEUKEMIA.\nImmunoperoxidase stains show that the majority of the cells are \npositive for CD34.  Subsets stain for CD68 and myeloperoxidase. \nThese findings suggest myelomonocytic differentiation. In \naddition, the morphologic findings within erythrocytes in the \nperipheral blood are highly suggestive of concurrent iron \ndeficiency anemia.\n.\nBONE MARROW BIOPSY (___):\nDIAGNOSIS:\nPersistent\/recurrent acute myeloid leukemia, see note.\nBone marrow with chemotherapy effect.\nNote: While the core biopsy seems to be depleted consistent with \nchemotherapy effect, focal areas of the core and predominantly \nin a single focus within the attached clot biopsy reveals \nclusters and sheets of immature monocytes.  This along with flow \ncytometry is strongly suspicious of recurrent\/persistent \ninvolvement of acute myeloid leukemia.  As discussed at the \nclinical hematopathology combined conference (___), while \nthe morphological \/ flow cytometry evidence is strong for \npersistent increased blasts within the specimen submitted, we \nare unable to equivocally determine if these blasts are in the \nprocess of being ablated. Correlation with clinical and \ncytogenetic studies is recommended.\n..\nRADIOLOGY:\n.\nCT ABDOMEN\/PELVIS (___):\nIMPRESSION:\n1. No evidence of retroperitoneal bleed.\n2. Evidence for acute uncomplicated diverticulitis without focal \nfluid\ncollection.\n3. Ill-defined retroperitoneal fat infiltration extending also \nalong the\niliac chains bilaterally may relate to stated underlying \ndiagnosis of AML,\nthough evaluation for change is limited without priors.\n4. Splenomegaly with focal hypodense lesions..\n5. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions.\n6. Ill-defined small ground-glass attenuation nodules at the \nleft lower lobe a nonspecific finding.\n7. Cholelithiasis.\n.\nCT CHEST (___):\nIMPRESSION:\n1. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions with RLL consolidation.\n2. Multiple hazy peribronchovascular and centrolobular pulmonary \nnodules\nlikely reflect small airways disease, infectious or \ninflammatory.\n3. Extensive retroperitoneal soft tissue stranding around the \nceliac axis may be leukemic or lymphomatous tissue, \nextramedullary hematopoiesis, or less likely early developing \nretroperitoneal fibrosis.\n4. Splenomegaly with 1.1 x 1.4 ill-defined hypodense lesion in \nthe spleen,\nunchanged.\n.\nCT ABDOMEN\/PELVIS (___):\nIMPRESSION:\n1. Increased bilateral pleural effusions with associated \nparenchymal volume\nloss. No evidence of empyema. Superimposed infection cannot be \nexcluded.\n2. Mesenteric stranding and colonic wall thickening which may \nrepresent\nindolent diverticulitis; however, other pathologies causing \nfocal wall\nthickness, such as mass\/lymphomatous disease, should be \nconsidered. Endoscopy maybe useful.\n3. Hepatosplenomegaly.\n4. Cholelithiasis without evidence of acute cholecystitis.\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nIn summary, Mr. ___ is a ___ y\/o M with newly diagnosed AML \ns\/p \"7+3\" regimen with AraC and Idarubicin now transitioning to \nsupportive care.\n.\n# AML \/ BLAST CRISIS:  WBC count of 96.9 on admission was \nconcerning for new presentation of acute leukemia. Bone marrow \nbiopsy on admission confirmed the diagnosis of AML with greater \nthan 50% blasts.  Emergent leukophoresis was considered but \ndeferred. He was treated with \"7+3\" regimen with cytarabine and \nidarubicin, which he tolerated moderately. Tumor lysis labs were \nmonitored and he was treated symptomatically. To help his blood \ncounts return to normal, G-CSF was started on a daily basis.\n.\n30 days after the start of induction chemotherapy, a repeat bone \nmarrow biopsy was done.  The full results are provided above; \nfindings were most consistent with relapsing leukemia.  \nPeripheral smears in the days that followed showed increasing \nnumbers of blast cells.  At time of discharge it is clear that \nhis disease is relapsing.  However, after discussion with both \nMr. ___, his wife and his daughter, the decision has been \nmade to hold off on more chemotherapy.  The risks of more \ntreatment, including prolonged neutropenia, fevers, infection, \nand longer hospitalization, outweigh the benefits to be had in \nterms of survival.  There have been several family meetings and \nthe course we have agreed upon is for supportive care with \ntransfusions and antibiotics.  \n.\n# PANCYTOPENIA:  He had thromboctopenia with PLT 21 and anemia \nwith HCT 25 on admission.  After chemotherapy, he continued to \nhave low counts and was transfused on an almost daily basis with \npRBC and PLTs. Etiology of instability was explored (antibody \nworkup, hemolysis workup); however, no clear source was \nidentified. On ___, he developed a fever and SOB while \nreceiving blood and triggered for a transfusion reaction.   He \nnow always receives tylenol with his transfusions.  However, the \nworkup was negative and it was thought at the time that his \nunderlying fevers (drug vs infxn) and fluid-overloaded status \nprovided a better explanation for his symptoms.\n.\n# FEVERS:  He developed fevers up to 104. Given his \npost-chemotherapy neutropenia, he was worked up for infectious \ncauses and covered with broad-spectrum antimicrobials. Lung \nstudies (CXR\/CT) showed findings consistent with pneumonia; \nhowever, he did not have significant cough and all of his blood \ncultures were negative.  A urine culture grew VRE and he \nreceived a ten-day course of daptomycin.  Abdominal CT showed \ncolonic fat stranding and wall thickening indicative of \ndiverticulitis.  He was treated with meropenem and this \ntransitioned to a PO regimen of ciprofloxacin and metronidazole. \n At time of discharge, he has been afebrile for over one week \nand his diarrhea has resolved.  He will continue on PO \ncipro\/Flagyl in the setting of prolonged neutropenia.\n.  \n# CHEST PAIN \/ DYSPNEA ON EXERTION:  He presented with DOE and \nhe had been complaining of SOB\/chest pain intermittently during \nhis stay in the hospital. His cardiac enzymes remained flat on \neach occasion and the chest pain resolved on its own. GI causes \nwere also considered, especially since he has been c\/o \ndifficulty swallowing; however, speech and swallow studies did \nnot reveal a clear source of dysphagia\/odynophagia.  He was \ntreated with pantoprazole and chest pain resolved.  \n.\n# VOLUME STATUS:  Because of his anemia and thrombocytopenia, he \nhad to be transfused with pRBC and platelets on a daily basis \nwhich resulted in severe fluid overload (2+ leg edema, scrotal \nedema, pulmonary effusions, mild pulmonary edema).  He was \nplaced on O2 and nebulizer as needed and aggressive diuresis was \nstarted with furosemide 40mg IV TID. Repeat TTE showed no \nworsening in heart function after chemotherapy with \nanthracycline.  Gradually as his transfusions became less \nfrequent the standing Lasix was stopped.  He now gets 20 mg IV \nlasix when he needs transfusions.  At time of discharge he \ncontinued to have 2+ pitting edema and he is satting in the mid \nto high 90's on room air.\n.\n# DIARRHEA:  He developed severe diarrhea in the setting of \nneutropenia. C diff was negative multiple times and stool \nstudies were non-revealing.  As above, CT abdomen showed colonic \nwall changes consistent with diverticulitis, and his diarrhea \nresolved after treatment with meropenem transitioned to levo and \nFlagyl which he will continue for one week after discharge.\n.\n# RENAL FAILURE:  Baseline creatinine was unknown at admission.  \nIncreased NSAID usage was likely contributing, but also there \nwas likely a prerenal component and possibly some degree of uric \nacid nephropathy given uric acid of 14.9 on admission. He was \ntreated with continuous IVF with sodium bicarbonate, allopurinol \nand hydroxyurea.  His kidney function normalized and these \nmedications were discontinued prior to discharge.\n\n \nMedications on Admission:\nNaproxen (Aleve)\nNo prescription meds  \n\n \nDischarge Medications:\n1. Please obtain a standard wheel chair with elevating leg rests \nto be delivered to the patient's home. \n2. Please obtain a 3-in-1 bedside commode to be delivered to the \npatient's home.\n3.

You received chemotherapy but the cancer could not be fully cured. Since you received chemotherapy your blood counts have been low and you have required multiple blood transfusions and will likely continue to require these transfusions. You were also diagnosed with diverticulitis (inflammation of your colon) and are being treated with antibiotics for this. We have added medications to your regimen. These include antibiotics to help treat and prevent infection. To treat the diverticulitis, you will need to take 500 mg of ciprofloxacin twice daily for 7 days and 500 mg of flagyl three times daily for 7 days. You should not consume alcohol while you are on flagyl as this can cause an adverse reaction. You will also need to permenantly take 12.5 mg of metoprolol twice daily."}

CTA of \nthe abdomen and pelvis also showed hyperenhancement of adjacent \nliver parenchyma, which is also consistent with acute \ncholecystitis. Patient's abdominal exam remained stable and ___ \ndid not have any guarding, rebound tenderness or ___ sign. \nAdditionally, patient's abdominal pain resolved after the first \nday of presentation and ___ remained asymptomatic. Patient \notherwise remained AFVSS, with downtrending leukocytosis (11 on \ndischarge), as well as negative blood cultures. Per ACS, will \ndefer inpatient cholecystectomy, and recommended medical \nmanagement. Patient was treated with cipro\/flagyl \n(___) per Dr. ___ recommendations. Patient \nwas well-appearing with a very stable abdominal exam on the day \nof discharge. ___ will follow-up with ACS in the outpatient \nsetting for evaluation and planning of cholecystectomy. \n\n#Duodenal ulcer, gastric ulcer, esophagitis: On presentation, \npatient had N\/V that included a few streaks of blood. ___ did not \nhave any melena. ___ was evaluated by the inpatient GI team who \nperformed an EGD, which showed a 3 cm ulcer without high risk \nstigmata of bleeding was found in the duodenal bulb. Patient was \nalso found to have a few small shallow ulcers in the stomach \nbody, severe esophagitis in the mid esophagus, and friability in \nthe lower esophagus. Patient was managed conservatively with IV \nPPI followed by transitioning to PO PPI. H pylori testing was \nnegative. Per GI, patient would benefit from repeat endoscopy in \n10 weeks. This was discussed with patient and family with aid of \ninterpreter who cited understanding and will arrange outpatient \nfollow up for repeat EGD. Patient did not have any evidence of \nGIB while ___ was hospitalized. \n\n#Leukocytosis: Patient with leukocytosis that peaked at 25.6 but \nsubsequently downtrended to 11.6 on the day of discharge. This \nis likely in the setting of acute cholecystitis. \n\n# Acute on chronic COPD exacerbation: During this admission, \npatient developed mild-to-moderate shortness of breath with \nwheezing on exam that was likely due to a COPD flair. ___ was \nbriefly started on 1L NC and as his wheezing\/respiratory status \nimproved, was weaned to room air. Patient was treated with \nstanding duonebs with PRN albuterol, as well as a ___t the time of discharge, his respiratory \nexam was clear bilaterally, ___ was satting well on RA, and had \nan ambulatory O2 >96%. Patient was resumed on his home COPD \nregimen on discharge. \n\n#Calcified abdominal mass: Patient was found on CT Abd\/Pelvis to \nhave a partially calcified lesion measuring 2.7 x 1.6 x 1.4 cm \nalong the small bowel mesenteric root is indeterminate. The \ndifferential considerations include calcified aneurysm versus \nmesenteric mass. This lesion is not amenable for biopsy. On the \nCTA Abd\/pelvis, this was again visualized at the branch of the \nSMA in the mid-abdomen. Per radiology, this was likely due to a \nthrombosed aneurysm and chronic. Carcinoid is less favored given \nthe absence of small bowel abnormality and jejunal location. \nBased on read seems most likely benign and is in a location \nwhich is not amenable to biopsy limiting our ability to work it \nup further.

No PFTs in our system but reports had been done \nin the past. Not on inhalers at home. The patient was placed on \nstanding duonebs and completed a 5 day course of prednisone 40mg \nand doxycycline on ___ with improvement of symptoms. Remained \nafebrile. Discharged home with nebulizer and duonebs with plans \nfollow-up with pulmonology clinic for further management.\n\n# Afib with RVR: On admission, the patient was noted to be in \nAfib with RVR with rates in 150s likely secondary to COPD \nexacerbation and dehydration. Had a transient episode of \nhypotension in ED with BP ___ which resolved with IVF \nbolus; mentating well throughout and no sensation of \npalpitations. Cardiology consulted and performed bedside TTE \nthat showed normal squeeze and no pleural effusion. The patient \nwas admitted to the CCU for further management. After admission, \nhe developed worsening chest pain with RVR in 140s which did not \nrespond to IVF bolus or diltiazem, and therefore he was loaded \nwith amiodarone gtt and 2 doses of digoxin. Troponins negative \nand EKG negative for ST changes. He then converted to NSR. He \nwas later transitioned to amiodarone 200mg daily and continued \non dabigatran for CHADS2VASc score of 3 (HTN, CHF, PAD). He \nremained in NSR and HD stable throughout the rest of his \nhospitalization.\n\n# Chest pain: The patient had chest pain in the setting of Afib \nwith RVR and COPD exacerbation. Troponins negative and EKG \nremarkable for Afib but no e\/o ST changes. CTA negative for PE. \nInitially there was concern for pericarditis given positional \nnature of the chest pain and recent URI symptoms (c\/f viral \npericariditis) and the patient was started on colchicine in the \nCCU. The medication was later discontinued once transferred to \nthe floor as concern for pericarditis was low-- no rub on exam, \nno PR depression or diffuse ST elevations on ECG and his chest \npain resolved. It was likely that the patient's chest pain was \ndue to his underlying COPD and persistent coughing which \nresolved as his symptoms improved.\n\n# Hypertension: The patient has a history of refractory \nhypertension currently on Amlodipine, lisinopril, carvedilol, \nand labetolol. These medications were initially held in the \nsetting of hypotension. His blood pressure improved s\/p \nconversion to NSR and he again became hypertensive with SBPs as \nhigh as 180. He was restarted on his home regimen with plans to \nfollow-up with Dr. ___ his primary care physician for \nfurther management. \n\n# HFpEF: BNP elevated to 1800 upon admission, but close to\/less \nthan prior value. CXR showed mild pulmonary congestion but exam \nwas negative for crackles in the lungs or peripheral edema. TTE \n___ with LVEF >55%, mild AR, very small pericardial effusion \nconsistent with prior echo from ___. No evidence of acute \nexacerbation in the hospital and the patient was restarted on \nhis home regimen once he returned to ___ and hypotension \nresolved. \n- preload: continued on Lasix 40mg PO daily\n- afterload: continued home lisinopril\n- contractility: initially started on metoprolol in CCU later \ntransitioned to home  carvedilol and labetalol on ___\n- strict I's and O's\n- low salt diet\n- daily standing weights\n\n# Hypotension: Became hypotensive in ED with SBP in ___ in the \nsetting of afib RVR (rates in 150s). Improved with IVF and \nconversion to NSR as above. Patient asymptomatic and mentating \nwell throughout. No further episodes of hypotension throughout \nhis hospital stay.\n\n# ___: Patient's creatinine elevated to 1.3 on admission likely \nin the setting of Afib with RVR and transient hypotension and \ndehyrdation. Resolved with IVF and returned to baseline of 0.9 \nupon discharge. \n\n#Anxiety: The patient suffers from significant anxiety \nespecially in the hospital environment. Maintained on his home \ndose of Ativan 0.5mg qid with prn doses as needed. Will need \nfurther management following discharge.\n\nCHRONIC ISSUES: \n# CAD s\/p DES ___: Continued ___, and restarted \nlabetolol and carvedilol upon discharge \n\n# PAD s\/p bilateral iliac stents ___: Continued ___, \naspirin, and pravastatin\n\n# Anemia: Long history of normocytic anemia with Hgb of 11.1 on \npresentation, relatively stable at 10.5.

Highest \nconcern was for recurrence of malignancy. The patient underwent \na dx and therapeutic thoracentesis of 1600ccs. The fluid was \nsent for cell count, culture and cytology. The fluid was \nconsistent with an exudate but did not seem infectious in nature \n(875 WBCs, 81% lymphs, 6% atypical cells; pH 7.44, LDH 107, \ntotal protein 4.3, glucose 91). Cytology is pending at this \ntime. Prior to thoracentesis, the patient's oxygen saturation \nwas in the low ___ on room air. After the procedure, she was \nsatting in the mid ___ on RA with ambulation. Her post-procedure \nchest x-ray did demonstrate persistance of a mild to moderate \neffusion and the patient was counselled that her symptoms may \nvery well recurr. In addition to the above studies, a \nnasopharyngeal swab was sent for viral culture and retuned \nnegative. She was asked to seek medical attention should her \nsymptoms recurr and follow up with her PCP ___ 2 weeks for \ncytology results and consideration of further chest imaging \ndepending on cytology results.\n\n# Hyponatremia. This resolved quickly with the administration of \n2L NS and may have been provoked by free water intake in a \npredisposed host who has had intermittent hyponatremia in the \npast. She was instructed to drink to thirst in the future and \nnot to exceed ___ L of volume intake. Her exam and labs \n(slightly altered upon arrival, tongue trauma, elevated CK) \nsuggested that she had symptomatic hyponatremia complicated by a \nseizure. Neurology was consulted and recommended MRI\/A of the \npatient's brain which was done and was negative for mass or \nvascular abnormality. After reviewing, the MRI\/A, the \nneurologists agreed that she likely seized due to acute \nhyponatremia and recommended against anti-epileptic medications \nbut, rather, just recommended control of sodium levels. In \naddition, given her elevated CK, she was instructed to hold her \nstatin until further discussion with her PCP.\n \n# Back pain. CT from ___ reported several compression \ndeformities. Given above c\/f malignancy, this was relayed to the \npatient to be followed up on by her PCP. While in house, her \nmotor, sensory and reflex exams were normal and she was treated \nsymptomatically with a lidopatch, valium, oxycodone and tylenol. \n \n   \n# Initial report of hematemesis and hemoptysis were further \nclarified. It seems the patient was coughing up blood tinged \nsputum and did not, in fact, experience hematemesis. This was \nclarified after the patient's sodium returned to normal and her \nmental status cleared. \n\nThe patient remained full code throughout her hospitalization. \n\n \nMedications on Admission:\nLISINOPRIL - (Prescribed by Other Provider) - 40 mg Tablet - 1  \n(One) Tablet(s) by mouth once a day  \nSIMVASTATIN - (Prescribed by Other Provider) - 20 mg Tablet - 1  \n\n(One) Tablet(s) by mouth once a day  \n.  \nMedications - OTC  \nCALCIUM CARBONATE-VITAMIN D3 - (OTC) - 600 mg-400 unit Tablet -  \n\n1 (One) Tablet(s) by mouth twice a day  \nMULTIVITAMIN - (OTC) - Tablet - 1 (One) Tablet(s) by mouth  \nonce a day  \n\n \nDischarge Disposition:\nHome\n \nDischarge Diagnosis:\nPrimary: \nPleural Effusion with associated lung collapse\nHyponatremia \nSeizure\nHypertension\n\nSecondary: \nDuctal Carcinoma of the right breast s\/p masectomy in ___\n\n \nDischarge Condition:\nMental Status: Clear and coherent.\nLevel of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.\nActivity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.","summary":"You were admitted to the hospital for shortness of breath with a low oxygen level and a low sodium level. You were found to have fluid in the space between your lung and your diaphragm. This fluid was drained using a procedure called a thoracentesis. The reason for the fluid accumulation is not clear and there are labs tests pending to help us determine the cause of the fluid accumulation. It is quite possible that this will happen again so you must seek medical attention if you become more short of breath or have any other new symptoms. Your sodium level may have dropped because of large volumes of water ingestion. Your sodium level increased to normal with IV infusion of salt water and remained normal for the rest of your hospital course. You should only drink between 1 and 1.5 liters of fluid per day. Because of concern for a seizure, you were seen by a neurology team. They recommended a MRI\/A of your brain which they reviewed. After reviewing your MRI, they felt you likely had a seizure related to low sodium and not any abnormalities in your brain. Your CT scan from ___ showed compression of several of your vertebrae. You were treated with pain medications and anti-spasm medications while in the hospital which you are being given to go home with as well. You should not drive or make important decisions while taking these medications."}

The grade 2 \nanterolisthesis of C6 on C7 and grade ___ anterolisthesis of C4 \non C5 are little changed allowing for differences in rotation. \n\n___ C-spine Xray: The patient is status post posterior fusion \nspanning C3-C6. There is again seen grade II anterolisthesis of \nC4 over C5 which measures 9 mm and is stable. There is also \nanterolisthesis of C6 over C7, which measures 11 mm and is also \nrelatively stable. Degenerative changes with loss of \nintervertebral disc height at multiple levels is seen. There is \nsclerosis of the C7 vertebral body. Overall, there has been no \nappreciable change. \n\n___ C-spine Xray:\nSingle side lateral film of the cervical spine shows posterior \nfusion hardware extending from C3 through C6. There is osseous \nanterior fusion of C2 and C3 as well as C5 and C6. There is a \ngrade 2 anterolisthesis of C4 on C5 and C6 on C7 with appearance \nunchanged from similar bedside exam 23 minutes earlier. \n\n___ portable chest Xray: No significant changes since prior \nstudy. Lungs are well expanded and clear bilaterally. There is \nno pleural effusion, masses or lesions.  There is no \npneumothorax. The cardiomediatinal silhouette is within normal \nlimits and stable. Pleural surfaces and osseous structures are \nunremarkable. \n\n___ CT cervical Spine: IMPRESSION: \nLimited study due to streak artifact from hardware demonstrates \nnew \nanterior cervical discectomy and fusion from C4 to T1. Expected \npostoperative changes. \n\n___ Chest Xray: As compared to the previous radiograph, there \nhas been a cervical fusion. There is no evidence of pneumonia or \nother pathologic changes in the lungs. Unchanged mild symetrical \napical thickening. Normal size of the cardiac silhouette. No \npleural effusions, no pneumothorax. \n\n___ Lower extremity doppler US: no evidence of DVT\n\n___ CT C-spine-\n1. C4-T1 anterior and C3-T3 posterior fusion. Increasing \nfluid\/air \ncollections throughout the prevertebral, intraspinal, and \nperivertebral spaces and superior mediastinum could represent \npost-surgical changes, but it is difficult to exclude \nsuperimposed infection. If clinically indicated, \ncontrast-enhanced study of the neck and chest could be ordered \nto assess for possible abscess, fistula, and\/or mediastinitis. \nThis was paged to nurse ___ on ___ \nat 12:50 a.m. \n2. Moderate retropharyngeal edema. Limited evaluation of \nsupraglottic \nstructures due to retained secretions \n\n___ CXR-\n: As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has \nreceived a \nleft-sided PICC line. The course of the line is unremarkable, \nthe tip of the line projects over the mid SVC. There is no \nevidence of complications, \nnotably no pneumothorax. \n\n___ CXR\nFINDINGS: Compared to the previous radiograph, there is no \nrelevant change.  The tip of the endotracheal tube projects 2.7 \ncm above the carina. The course of the left-sided PICC line is \nconstant. No acute lung changes. Normal size of the cardiac \nsilhouette. Vertebral stabilization devices in unchanged \nposition. \n\n  \n___ CXR: FINDINGS: In comparison with study of ___, the tip of \nthe endotracheal tube measures about 5 cm above the carina. \nNasogastric tube extends well into the stomach. No acute \ncardiopulmonary disease. \n\n___ EEG:\nIMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study \nbecause \nof a slow and disorganized background. There is diffuse slowing \nof \nbackground for a few hours which could be indicative of \nmedication \neffect. However, the background activity appears again after \nthat \nportion of the recording. These findings are indicative of a \nmild \ndiffuse encephalopathy which is etiologically non-specific. \nThere were \nno focal asymmetries or epileptiform features. Compared to the \nprior \nday's recording, there is slight improvement and more \norganization of \nthe background activity. \n\n___ CXR A tracheostomy is in place. At the periphery of these \nfilms, cervical fixation hardware is noted. The apices are \nobscured by overlying mask.  Allowing for this, the lungs appear \nhyperinflated. Heart size is at the upper limits of normal. \nThere is upper zone redistribution, without overt CHF.  There is \nminimal hazy density in the left lung, which most likely \nrepresents mild atelectasis. No frank consolidation or gross \neffusion. Left subclavian PICC line tip overlies mid\/lower SVC. \nAllowing for artifact due to the oxygen mask, no pneumothorax is \ndetected. \n\n___ LENIES\nFINDINGS: Grayscale and color Doppler sonograms with spectral \nanalysis of the bilateral common femoral veins, superficial \nfemoral and popliteal veins was performed. There is normal \ncompressibility, flow and augmentation. There is normal flow and \ncompressibility in the left peroneal and posterior tibial veins. \nThe right calf veins were not visualized.   \nIMPRESSION: No bilateral lower extremity DVT. Right calf veins \nnot \nvisualized. \n\n___: CT C-spine\/neck\nIMPRESSION: \nPreliminary Report1. 2.5 x 2.1 x 6.2 cm fluid collection at the \nsurgical access site at the posterior cervical spine extending \nfrom C2 to T1 might be postsurgical, however, superimposed \ninfection cannot be excluded. \n2. Interval decrease of the previously seen prevertebral and \nsuperior \nmediastinal fluid collections.  3. 2.4-cm \nsupraglottic\/pre-epiglottic soft tissue mass. DDx includes \nectopic thyroid, atypical thyroglossal duct cyst or supraglottic \ncarcinoma.  \n\n___:\nFINDINGS: The liver shows no focal or textual abnormalities. \nThe portal vein is patent showing hepatopetal flow. \n  \nMultiple small gallbladder stones are seen. \nNo thickening or edema is seen in the gallbladder wall. \nThere is no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary duct dilatation. The \nCBD measures 0.3 cm.  \n  \nThe right kidney measures 10.2 cm and is normal without \nhydronephrosis or \nstones. The left kidney measures 8.8 cm and is normal without \nhydronephrosis or stones. \nAtherosclerotic disease of the aorta. \nIMPRESSION: Cholelithiasis without signs of cholecystitis. \n  \n___:\nMRI of head- \nIMPRESSION:  \n1. Hyperintense signal on diffusion weighted and FLAIR images in \nright medial frontal and parietal lobe without corresponding low \nsignal on ADC images. This likely represents seizure related \nchange. \n2.FLAIR hyperintensity in left posterior temporal lobe sulci, \nwhich is \nunchanged since the prior study. This likely represents a \ncortical vein \n3. Focal and confluent T2\/FLAIR hyperintensities in bilateral \nperiventricular and subcortical white matter of bilateral \ncerebral hemispheres and pons. The differential for this finding \nincludes demyelination, changes of chronic small vessel ischemic \ndisease or changes of vasculitis.  \n4. No abnormal leptomeningeal or parenchymal enhancement. \n\n___ MRI of c-spine: \n1. Post-operative changes in the form of anterior fusion from C4 \nto T1 \nvertebrae and posterior fusion at T2-T3 level. Although it is \ndifficult to \ncompare across imaging modalities, and the MR images are \nobscured by artifact \nfrom the fusion hardware, anterolisthesis of C3 over the fused \nvertebrae \nappears more severe than the prior CT. Repeat CT is advised if \nclinically \nindicated.   \n2. Peripherally enhancing collection in posterior paraspinal \nsoft tissues \nfrom C2 to C5 level which likely represents post-operative fluid \ncollection. This has decreased in size since the prior study.   \n3. Hyperintense signal in the spinal cord at C6-C7 level, which \nlikely \nrepresents edema from prior compression.   \n4. No abnormal leptomeningeal or intramedullary enhancement.  \n5. Supraglottic mass which is better evaluated on the prior CT \nimages. \n\n___ EEG:\n \nFINDINGS:  \nCONTINUOUS EEG RECORDING: Began at 7:01 on the morning of ___ \n___ and \ncontinued through 19:53 that evening.

Her imaging studies were uploads and \nrevealled C7 to T1 listhesis.  \nPatient was admitted to the intensive care unit and placed in \ncervical traction. After reducing adequately, she was taken to \nthe Operating room on ___ and underwent a ___ \nCorpectomies and C4-T1 Fusion. This was without complication. \nShe was extubated, removed from traction and transferred back to \nthe ICU. Post operative CT revealed good fusion. A SOMI brace \nwas ordered and she was liberalized to HOB at 45 degrees. \n\nThe patient was febrile to 102.6 on ___ with a leukocytosis of \n17.7.  Blood and urine cultures were sent. CXR did not show a \ndefinite infiltrate however the patient did have a productive \ncough.  In the setting of elevated WBC, fever and cough she was \nstarted on Levofloxacin for PNA.  Sputum culture was requested. \nLower extremity dopplers were negative for DVT.\n\nA speech and swallow eval was ordered given patient's swallowing \ndifficulties and was performed on ___.  Unfortunately the \npatient failed the study and so she was placed on strict NPO \ndiet.\n\nOn ___ she was taken back to the OR and underwent a C3-T3 \nfusion. During positioning she was noted to have a sacral \ndecubitis so a wound care consult was called. INR was 1.5 and \nHCT was 22 so she was transfused with PRBC's and FFP. Post \noperatively she was not extubated due to laryngeal edema \n(difficult intubation) therefore ENT was consulted for \nevaluation. They recommended steroids, PPI and to keep her \nintubated. She was continued on vanc\/gent for prophylaxsis. On \n___ her exam was grossly stable but difficult to examine due to \nbeing intubated. CT C-spine revealed moderate retropharyngeal \nedema but no hardware malfunction or misalignment. On ___ she \nremained stable, extubation was discussed but she was not doing \nwell on CPAP trial and also did not have a cuff leak.\n\nOn ___, patient self extubated. She was breathing well on face \nmask. Strength was full post operatively and her pain was being \ntreated with morphine.  \n\nOn ___, the decadron was being weaned due to delirium and she \nrequired the addition of olanzapine. She was febrile to 101 on \n___ and she was pancultured. On this day she was reintubated \nfor hypoxia. She required high sedation to prevent self \nextubation. \n\nOn ___ the patient was being prepped for the OR with ENT but \nwas noticed in the afternoon to be unresponsive with eyes \ndeviated laterally and out, with flickering of the eye lids. She \nwas given dilantin and ativan and a stat Head CT was performed \nwhich was questionable for a right temporal hypodensity. Per \nneurorad recommendation an MRI was performed. This was negative \nfor stroke or lesion therefore an EEG was ordered to rule out \nseizure activity. EEG was negative therefore it was discontinued \nalong with the dilatin.\n\nOn ___ the patient was very lethargic so her sedation was held \n(> 1 hr) for examination. During this time she self-extubated. \nO2 sats were stable but she was noted to be aspirating therefore \nshe was reintubated and subsequently trached.\n\nOn ___ she was neurologically stable and vent was weaned to a \ntrach collar. Her staples were d\/c'd.\n\nOn ___ patient was transferred to the floor. However, she spiked \nanother low grade temp of 100.8 and was recultured and had an \nadditional chest x-ray. Fever work-up was negative, except for \npositive pan-sensitive pseudomonas on sputum culture. \n\nOn ___ Infectious disease consult was called due to patient's \nleukocytosis and continued fevers. They recommended switching \nher antibiotics to Cefepime, obtaining a mini-bal, a clostridium \ndifficile culture, and possible ___ guided LP. These studies were \nfound to be negative. \n\nOn ___ Her INR was found to be trending upwards.  Hematology was \nconsulted for their input and recommended Vit. K+.  Her PEG was \ndelayed because on her fever and wbc.  Nutrition recommendations \nfor TPN was initiated. ENT was also re-contacted for possibility \nof scoping this pt for eval of possible para-vocal mass that was \ninitially seen on intubation for ACDF. Due to concern \nsurrounding her waxing\/wanning mental status\n\nOn ___ Her INR returned to normal, her TPN was initiated as per \nnutrition. ENT did a fiberoptic evaluation and they found poor \nmanagement of secretions, but no mass and they signed off. She \nhad her LP in INR on this day. Neuromedicine saw her and fel;t \nthat she was in a oculogyrate crisis. Benadryl was given without \ngood effect. She was transfered to medicine due to the \ncomplexity of her problems.\n\nHer medical floor course can be summarized as follows:\n======================================================\nINACTIVE TISSUES:\n=================\n#. FEVERS\/LEUKOCYTOSIS:  She was inherited on vanco\/cefepime \nbroad spectrum antibiotics without clear source of infection- a \npan sensitive psuedomonas was found in the sputum but no \nradiographic evidence of pneumonia was ever apparent. On ___, \nher antibiotics were discontinued due to the lack of fevers and \na downtrending WBC.  A small fluid collection seen on CT along \nthe posterior cervical surgical incision site was sampled via \n___, with a bland fluid not suggestive of \ninfection.  Urine, blood cultures were negative, as were C dif.  \nOn ___, she spiked to 102, she was then restarted on vanco and \ncefepime. She had pan culture which at the time was all \nnegative. Her only + culture was from sputum the day before with \npan-sensitive pseudomonas, although there was no radiologic \nevidence of infection (pneumonia) this was thought to be causing \nelevation in WBC- so she was treated with cefepime for a total \nof 10 days last day was on ___ and she has been afebrile since \nthen. \n\n#. DELIRIUM\/ENCEPHALOPATHY: she showed a waxing and waning level \nof responsiveness.  EEG had previously shown only diffuse \nslowing of encephalopathy, which could have been from her \nsurgical interventions, steroids, zyprexa, infection.  There was \nconcern for seizure activity due to contraction of the arms and \neye deviation, so an extended EEG was conducted without definite \nevidence of seizures. Deliriogenic meds avoided. She was then \ntreated for seizures with Keppra and then Dilantin was added \nsince she continue to have seizure activity. Within hours of her \ndilantin infusion, she developed a severe rash. So this was \nstopped and she was continued on keppra and started on \nLacosamide. She was doing well and then had her last episode of \nconfusion last week in the setting of receiving trazadone for \nsleep and pain meds. Her sedating meds were held and pt has been \ndoing much better. Now A+O x 3. She was restarted on oxycodone \nfor pain and I would consider restarting Ambien once pt is \nstable on her new location. There were multiple head images \nwhich did not show anatomical cause of her confusion or seizures\n\n#. OCULOGYRIC CRISIS:  she had a dystonic reaction from zyprexa \nwith an unclosable mouth and eye deviation.  This lysed with IV \nbenadryl on ___.  She had similar symptoms on ___ which again \nresponded to IV benadryl.  Anti-psychotics were avoided.\n\nACTIVE ISSUES:\n===============\n\n#  Seizures: Has been having unusual EEG activity and three \nconfirmed seizures since ___, most recently on ___. She was \nloaded on Keppra on ___. Loaded with dilantin on ___ but \nexperienced a drug rash. She then had recurrence of witnessed sz \nover the weekend on ___ that lasted 3 min with lip smacking, \narm movement and blinking. No other event since then. Spoke to \nneurology who recommended increasing dose of Lacosamide from \n200-> 300 mg on ___. We still uncertain what is causing the sz \nactivity, multiple head images did not show anatomical causes. \nPossible encephalalitis r\/t medications.  However, pt has \nremained stable. Neuro is okay with us restarting pt on \nneurontin for neuropathic pain, so this was done on ___ and \ndose was increased to BID. \n- Continue ___ Keppra 1500mg BID and Lacosamide 300mg BID\n- Started on neurontin 300mg ___ on ___ for neuropathic pain \nwhich can increase to BID today if tolerating well and may \nincrease to TID \n- Neurology will be calling your facility to schedule a \nfollow-up appointment within 2 weeks. \n\n# s\/p Tracheostomy: Patient was complaining of sore throat and \ndiscomfort. No change in oxygen saturations. Dr. ___, \n___ surgeon, did not feel she was amenable to a trach \nrevision to a smaller trach.  Recommended ENT evaluation for \nincreased secretions, failed speech and swallow, apparent \ndifficulty with the trach. ENT saw pt on ___t \nbedside and findings are consistent with weakened muscles and \naspiration, so no intervention at this time, except for cont \nwith trach care, humidified oxygen and speech therapy. She also \nhad video swallow on ___ that showed aspiration. So for now pt \nshould cont to be NPO.  \n- Continue supplemental oxygen via trach mask\n- Trach care\n- Cont to work with speech therapy\n- Pt able to clear secreations and to use passmier valve\n.\n\n# s\/p cervical fusion\/Anterolisthesis: she was taken to the \noperating room on ___ and underwent a ___ Corpectomies \nand C4-T1 Fusion. This was without complication, but as noted \nabove she had multiple complications. Anterolisthesis (anterior \ndislocation of her spinous process) was found to have worsened \non the most recent MRI c-spine.  SOMI cervical brace was placed \nper Neurosurgery and should be on at all times. The brace was \njust adjusted yesterday and is fitting more comfortable by \npatient. She has small pressure ulcer on her chin that is \nhealing and on the back of her head that is also healing. \nNeurosurgery will be following the patient and she has \nappointment on ___. She will have a repeat CT scan at \nthat time.  \n- Per neurosurgery: Patient must be lying flat if she is in an \naspen collar, otherwise she must be put in a full neck brace at \nall times (would prefer not changing from SOMI brace to Collar \nsince concern for dislocation).\n\n# Pain: pt with pain at her surgical site and due to position \nrelated to brace. She has also chronic neuropathic pain and has \nbeen on neurontin and multiple meds prior to her admission. She \nasked to have neurotin restarted. Neuro was okay in adding this \nmedication. \n- Cont on tylenol ___ Q 6 hours as needed \n- Restarted on oxycodone 5mg Q 6 hours as needed\n- Restarted on neurotin 300mg once ___, will increase to BID \ntomorrow if tolerates and to TID on the following day\n.\n# CP\/SOB: Patient had previously reported having new, sudden \nonset chest pain that was sharp and substernal ___. Normal EKG, \nCXR and Trop. CKMB was initially 18.8 and has been trended down \nto 11. Given downward trend and current clinical status there is \nno concern for ACS.  Demand ischemia was considered but cardiac \necho performed on ___ showed that the left ventricular regional \nand global systolic functions are normal w\/ only mild aortic \nregurgitation.  CKMB may be originating from brain tissue.\n-Continue lipitor, low dose aspirin, and metoprolol\n.\n# Brain imaging findings: There were initial concerns about \nvasculitis since MRI of brain on ___ that showed focal and \nconfluent T2\/FLAIR hyperintensities in bilateral periventricular \nand subcortical white matter of bilateral cerebral hemispheres \nand pons. The differential for this finding includes \ndemyelination, changes of chronic small vessel ischemic disease \nor changes of vasculitis. So, rheumatology was consulted for \nevaluation of vasculitis, especially given her hx of + ___. She \nalso had a MRA brain on ___ was not c\/w vasculitis. Rheum panel \nwas sent w\/ only abnormality being anticardiolipin antibody IgM \nelevated to 16.2, which may occur with vasculitis, SLE or ACA \nsyndrome. However rheumo does not think that pt's findings are \nconsistent with vasculitis. \n.\n# Drug rash: Due to dilantin given timing of rash with dilantin \nadministration. Allergy list updated\n- Hold dilantin\n.\n# Blurry vision: Pt c\/o \"foggy vision at times\" which has been \nhappening since surgery. She with normal visual acuity. She was \nalso evaluted by neuro and had multiple head images which did \nnot show an anatomical abnormality. This does not appear to be \nan acute issue. The other potentially cause could be optic \nneuritis due to MS. ___ has not been r\/o yet as the MRI findings \nare some what suggestive.\n- she will be followed by neuro\n.\n# SKIN: pt with a small healing ulcer on submandibular are and \nscab on posterior occipital area. She also had a very small \nsacral decubitus ulcer that has healed. No signs of infection. \nCont with positioning and skin care.  \n.\n.\n# FEN:  replete electrolytes, NPO on TPN, Q4H oral care \n# Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin (MAY BE D\/C WITH INCREASE \nMOBILITY), ppi, bowel regimen  \n# Access: peripherals  \n# code: Full code (from chart) \n# Communication: Patient and her husband \n# ___ at ___\n\nTRANSITION OF CARE:\n===================\n\n# She will need to follow-up with Neurology who will be calling \nto schedule appointment with 2 weeks. If you do not hear from \nthen by ___, please call the neurology office to schedule \nf\/u appointment at ___\n\n# Continue to monitor for seizures, pt may continue to have occ \nseizures (usually associated with blank starring with blinking \nof the eyes, and arm movement. This has only lasted a few \nminutes at the time. During her last episode on ___ she had an \nepisode of hypoxia and had to have supplement 02 via AMBU bag \nfor a short period of time and this quickly improved with \nsupportive care.

Heart attacks are caused by blockages in the coronary arteries that supply the heart muscle, whose pumping function depends on a constant supply of oxygen delivered by the blood supplied by these arteries. Severe blockages in the coronary arteries can cause the symptoms that you experienced because they deprive your heart of oxygen. During this hospitalization, the blockage in your coronary arteries that were causing your symptoms was opened during a procedure called a cardiac catheterization. During this procedure, a device called a stent was placed in the blocked artery to open the artery, restore blood flow through the artery and, in turn, restore oxygen supply to your heart muscle. This procedure should help to improve your symptoms and prevent future heart attacks. The catheterization, however, is only one part of your treatment; the other part of your treatment is your new medication regimen."}

Based \non history, suggestive of upper source (also BUN\/Cr ratio quite \nhigh), possible ulcer, especially in light of chronic prednisone \nuse. However, the patient was adamant that she did not want an \nEGD or colonoscopy. This was discussed with her family as well. \nShe understood the risks of forgoing endoscopy. She felt like \nshe was too old and did not want any interventions. She \ncontinued to have melena throughout her hospital stay, but her \nH\/H stabilized. She received a total of 3 units pRBCs and 1 unit \nof platelets during this hospital stay. Her most recent blood \ntransfusion was on ___ and from then until discharge on ___, \nher H\/H remained stable and she was hemodynamically stable. Her \nwarfarin was held on discharge until she can follow up with her \nPCP. This was discussed with the patient and she understood that \nthere is a risk of stroke off warfarin. \n\n# ___\nBaseline Cr ~1.4-1.5, presented with 2.0. Most likely this was \npre-renal from bleeding and concurrent diuresis. Her Cr returned \nto baseline (1.4) by the time of discharge. Her torsemide was \ninitially held, then resumed at half her home dose until she can \nfollow up with her PCP. \n\n# Hypernatremia\nLikely from volume depletion and from diuresis. This improved \nwith increased PO intake.\n\n# R ankle pain\n# Severe RA\nShe had no swelling or erythema and per patient no recent \ntrauma. Ankle XR showed no fracture or dislocation. ESR is up \nfrom ___ but CRP is down. This was consistent with her prior \nRA flares. She was continued on her home dose of prednisone 5 mg \ndaily. Her methotrexate was held. She was also given \nacetaminophen and a lidocaine patch. The lidocaine patch \nsignificantly relieved her pain.\n\nCHRONIC\/STABLE PROBLEMS:\n# CAD\n# LV Aneurysm\n# Chronic Systolic Heart Failure\n# Severe Aortic Stenosis\nLV aneurysm and history of strokes make the therapeutic decision \nof ongoing anticoagulation along with unresolved etiology of GI \nbleeding challenging. As discussed above, her warfarin was held \non discharge due to ongoing melena with stable H\/H. Unclear why \npatient is not on aspirin. She appeared euvolemic on exam \ndespite holding torsemide for most of her hospital stay. Her \nhome atorvastatin, metoprolol, and lisinopril were continued. \n\n# History of DVT\n- pneumoboots used in the hospital\n\nMs. ___ is clinically stable for discharge.

She developed transient hypovolemic shock, \nlikely secondary to dehydration in the setting of diarrhea and \nnausea, complicated by syncope. She was transferred to the ICU, \nand started on broad spectrum antibiotics (cipro\/flagyl\/vanc), \nand received 3L LR. Blood pressures improved, but due to \nborderline MAPs and rise in lactate to 2.2, she briefly required \nlevophed for several hours. Her diarrhea improved and BPs \nremained stable off pressors, and she was transferred to ___, \nwhere she remained stable. \n\nACUTE ISSUES\n============\n#Diarrhea\n#Colitis\nMs. ___ presented with diarrhea, which was thought to be a \ntreatment complication of protocol ___. She has a history of \nC. Diff, but testing was negative. CT A\/P revealed \"acute \ncolitis extending from the descending colon through the rectum, \nlikely infectious in etiology.\" Per GI, there was no need for \nendoscopic intervention unless diarrhea recurred. They felt the \ncolitis was likely secondary to ischemia, given that the \nterritory involved was likely supplied by single vessel. \nDiarrhea was complicated by hypovolemic shock and vasovagal \nreaction for which she was briefly in ICU. Diarrhea resolved \nwith short course of loperamide. She was also treated with \nempiric cipro\/flagyl (___), and completed a 5 day course of \nempiric antibiotics. She will hold antibiotics until being seen \nby her oncologist in ___. \n\n#Hypovolemic Shock\n#Syncope\nShock was thought to likely be secondary to fluid losses from \nsignificant diarrhea, which has now\nresolved. She also experienced an episode of syncope during this \nacute hypotension\/diarrhea. She never had any focal neurologic \ndeficits. Hypotension was also thought to be in part due to \nconcurrent use of Metoprolol and Diltiazem for her Atrial \nFibrillation. Cortisol stimulation testing was negative for \nadrenal insufficiency. TTE showed low normal LVEF and mild \nvalvular abnormalities. She received fluid resuscitation and \nbrief pressors in ICU, and remained normotensive on the floor.\n\n#AFib (on apiaxaban)\nDuring her hospitalization, she was intermittently in AFib and \nintermittently in normal sinus rhythm. While hypotensive, she \nwas found to be in AFib with RVR. Home medications were briefly \nheld in the setting of recent shock, but heart rates remained \nelevated. Eventually, Ms. ___ was discharged on a new \nregimen of only Metoprolol 50 BID. She continued on her home \nApixaban.\n\nCHRONIC\/RESOLVED ISSUES\n=======================\n#Follicular lymphoma (Protocol ___\nMs. ___ is a patient of Dr. ___.

She found him on the ground next to the couch upon which \nhe\nhad been sleeping.  She said that he seemed somewhat disoriented\nand was unable to recount what had happened.  She got him up \ninto\nthe chair.  She had him raise his right arm which he did\npromptly.  She then asked him to raise his left arm and he \nraised\nthe right.  She asked again and he then raised the left but it\nseemed slower and weaker.  He told her he was ok and for her to\ngo to work today.  When she got home from work she noted that he\nwas still somewhat disoriented and favoring his left side.  His\nother family members also noted that he was not attending to the\nleft side.  They called oncology who instructed him to come to\nthe ER.  In the ER he was noted to have a left drift and left\nneglect.

There \nis a new \nfocus of hypodensity identified in the right frontal lobe \ninvolving both the gray and white matter. The appearance is most \nconsistent with cytotoxic edema secondary to acute infarct. \nThere is minimal mass effect on the adjacent frontal horn of \nlateral ventricle. Ventricles otherwise normal in size and \nconfiguration. There is no shift of midline structures. There \nare no abnormal extra-axial fluid collections. The gray-white \nmatter differentiation in the basal ganglia is preserved. \nVisualized bones demonstrate no acute abnormality. Paranasal \nsinuses and mastoid air cells are normally aerated. \n.  \nIMPRESSION: New hypodensity in the right frontal lobe, with \nappearance \nsuggestive of cytotoxic edema suggesting acute infarction. \nFurther evaluation with MRI is recommended. \n.\nMRI\/A Head and Neck (___):\nFINDINGS: There is no hemorrhage. There are multiple areas of \nabnormally \nrestricted diffusion involving the right frontal lobe, including \nthe large \narea seen on CT, as well as multiple punctate and smaller foci \nin the \nperisylvian region, within the right basal ganglia, in the \ncortex as well as the periventricular white matter, all within \nthe MCA territory distribution.  Most of these are now bright on \nT2\/FLAIR images as well. There is some local mass effect, \nparticularly from the largest of these lesions, but no shift of \nnormally midline structures, and no effacement of the right \nlateral ventricle. There is no hydrocephalus. There is mild \nprominence of ventricles, sulci and extra-axial CSF spaces. \nThere is mucosal thickening of scattered ethmoid air cells and a \nretention cyst in the left maxillary sinus. \n.  \nIMPRESSION: Several acute to subacute infarcts within the right \nMCA \nterritory. Findings are most suggestive of an embolic etiology. \n.  \nMRA OF THE HEAD: The study is limited by motion. There is a \npaucity of M3 \nand M4 branches within the right middle cerebral artery. There \nmay be an \nright MCA branch (102:6). There is no large aneurysm. \n.  \nIMPRESSION: Loss of flow signal within multiple M3 and M4 \nbranches in the \nright middle cerebral artery territory, and possible vessel \nocclusion, are \nalso compatible with embolic phenomenon. \n.  \n3D NON-CONTRAST TIME-OF-FLIGHT MRA OF THE NECK: The common and \ninternal \ncarotid arteries appear normal in caliber throughout their \ncourse, as do the vertebral arteries, without evidence of \nocclusion or hemodynamically \nsignificant stenosis. The origins of the great vessels are not \nwell seen. \n.  \nIMPRESSION: No evidence of hemodynamically significant stenosis \nor occlusion within the vessels of the neck. \n.  \n___ (___):\nIMPRESSION: Extensive deep vein thrombosis bilaterally extending \nfrom the \ncommon femoral vein to the popliteal vein. \n.\nTransthoracic Echocardiogram (___):\nDue to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion \nabnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular \nsystolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). There is a \ntrivial\/physiologic pericardial effusion. \n.\nIMPRESSION: Extremely limited study. Grossly-preserved left \nventricular systolic function. \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nMr. ___ is a ___ year-old right-handed man with a past \nmedical history including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and \npappillary renal cell cancer (metastatic to retroperitoneal and \nparacaval lymph nodes) who presented with left sided weakness \nand neglect.  He was admitted to the stroke service from ___ \nto ___.\n.\nAs there was concern for a right hemispheric stroke, an emergent \nCT of the head was performed.  The study demonstrated a \nhypodensity in the right frontal lobe associated with cytotoxic \nedema suggesting acute infarction. An MRI of the head and  neck \ndemonstrated several acute to subacute infarcts within the right \nMCA \nterritory.  MR angiography revealed loss of flow signal within \nmultiple M3 and M4 branches in the right middle cerebral artery \nterritory, and possible vessel occlusion thought to be \ncompatible with embolic phenomenon. The vessel imaging in the \nneck showed no contributory abnormalities to suggest artery to \nartery emboli.  \n.\nIn the setting of acute stroke, the aspirin was restarted at \nfull dose (325 mg po daily).  Blood pressure was allowed to \nautoregulate.\n.  \nIn the context of extended immobility and malignancy, there was \nconcern for deep vein thrombosis (DVT).  Ultrasound imaging of \nthe lower extremities confirmed extensive deep vein thrombosis \nbilaterally extending from the common femoral vein to the \npopliteal vein. Accordingly, a heparin drip was started with a \ngoal PTT of 50 to 70, and aspirin was discontinued.  At Dr. \n___ oncologist) recommendation, lovenox 1mg\/kg \nevery 12 hours (rather than coumadin) was started prior to \ndischarge for long-term anti-coagulation.  The lovenox should be \ncontinued for at least six months. Of note, if renal function \ndeclines (eg creatinine increases above 2), the lovenox dosing \nshould be adjusted to 1mg\/kg q 24 hours.\n.\nGiven the embolic apperance of the strokes and the presence of \nDVTs, a transthoracic echocardiogram was done to evaluate for a \npatent foramen ovale (PFO).  Unfortunately, the study was \nsub-optimal and could not determine whether or not a PFO was \npresent. The estimated systolic function was normal (LVEF >55%).\n.\nTo evaluate modifiable risk factors for stroke, lipids and \nglycosylated hemoglobin were measured.  As the LDL was found to \nbe 119, the statin dose was increased to 10 mg daily to 20 mg po \ndaily with a goal LDL of approximately 70.

Patient has underlying dementia at \nbaseline per prior OMR records, but per daughter the current \nsymptoms are acute. Patient was alert and oriented at time of \ninitial exam, but speech was very tangential\/rambling. The \npatient's mental status waxed and waned over the course of this \nadmission. Given recent fall, there is concern for possible late \nsubdural bleed, although head CT negative. Patient's UA was \nsuggestive of possible UTI (culture ultimately grew E. coli), \nand per nursing urine was foul-smelling. Infection could also \ncause acute delirium. Pain in arm from fall could also \ncontribute. Finally, patient reports recent frequent vomiting \nand may have become dehydrated - this could also contribute to \ndelirium. The patient received IVF to correct dehydration. \nTramadol was stopped. Acetaminophen was started to control any \npain from his fall. Telemetry and Foley were ultimately \ndiscontinued to minimize lines. The patient was re-oriented as \nneeded. UTI was treated with antibiotics. The patient's mental \nstatus improved, although not quite to his baseline per \ndaughters. The patient and his family were cautioned that the \ndelirium may come and go over the next few days to weeks. The \npatient was asked not to drive until after his follow up \nappointment with his PCP. \n \n# UTI. UA was positive on admission. Patient self-catheterizes \nat home three times daily given BPH. This is likely to introduce \norganisms into the bladder, and long periods of urine stasis \nlikewise will promote infection. Prior cultures in our system \nhave grown coag-positive staph and enterococcus. Patient \nreceived ceftriaxone until cultures returned positive for \npan-sensitive E. coli on the day of discharge; he was then \nconverted to ciprofloxacin to complete a 10-day course for \ncomplicated UTI.\n\n# Recent fall. Per patient, this was a mechanical event - states \nhe slipped on ice which he mistook for a puddle. He landed on \nhis left elbow but feels most pain in his left shoulder. No \nvisible markings on elbow which patient states is because he was \nwearing a heavy overcoat. No acute changes on plain film from \n___. He was observed to use his arm minimally, although \npassive range of motion was intact. Additional plain films of \nthe humerus were obtained which showed no fracture. He was seen \nby occupational and physical therapy services, who recommend \ninitial home OT followed by outpatient ___ until recovered. He \nwas placed on standing acetaminophen 500 mg QID while in-patient \nto minimize pain (although patient had few complaints at rest) \nas well as contribution of pain to altered mental status. \nTramadol was discontinued.\n\n# Vomiting. Per patient, has vomited several times over past few \ndays in response to eating. He attributes N\/V to the tramadol \nwhich also causes a \"bitter taste.\" Gastroenteritis also a \npossibility. No N\/V during this admission. The patient received \nIVF as above to correct any dehydration. Tramadol was held as \nabove. \n\n# Vertigo. Patient reports vertigo symptoms (\"the room is \nspinning\") earlier on the day of admission. Has symptoms on and \noff at baseline. During this admission, patient's symptoms were \nmild. Continued on meclizine.\n\n# Urinary retention. Secondary to BPH. ___ was placed \ninitially, but prior to discharge ___ was removed and patient \nwas allowed to straight cath himself. He was able to do so \nsuccessfully (not limited by pain in his left arm\/shoulder), but \nthe nurse noted that patient's clean technique could use \nimprovement. \n\n# Hypercholesterolemia. Continued on simvastatin.\n\n# Insomnia. Continued on oxazepam as the patient reported he \ntakes this medication nightly. If delirium persists, would \nconsider weaning off as an outpatient.\n\n# Anemia. Hct found to be at baseline (mid-30s).

A type 1 choledochal \ncyst is noted, measuring 4.6 x 4.2 x 6.5 cm (TRV x AP x CC), \nbest seen on (series 2, image 23 and series 601, image 16). \nOtherwise, there is no pancreatic ductal dilatation or \nintrahepatic ductal dilatation. The pancreas is unremarkable. \nThe gallbladder itself is normal in appearance, and thin-walled, \nwith no evidence of gallstones or gallbladder wall thickening. \nThe spleen, bilateral adrenal glands, bilateral kidneys, stomach \nand intra-abdominal loops of large and small bowel are normal in \nappearance. The kidneys demonstrate symmetric nephrograms and \nexcretion of contrast, with no evidence of obstruction or \nhydronephrosis. Enteric contrast is seen to the level of the \nsigmoid. There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric \nlymphadenopathy. No intraperitoneal free air or free fluid is \nidentified. \n  \nCT PELVIS: The pelvic loops of large and small bowel are normal \nin \nPreliminary Report appearance. Although the appendix is not \ndefinitely visualized, no secondary signs of appendicitis are \nseen. Trace simple free fluid is noted in the pelvis (2:64). The \nbladder and terminal ureters are unremarkable. The prostate is \nnormal. There is no pelvic sidewall or inguinal lymphadenopathy. \n\n  \nOSSEOUS STRUCTURES: No lytic or blastic lesion suspicious for \nmalignancy is identified. \n  \nIMPRESSION: \n1. No acute pathology in the abdomen or pelvis. \n2. Incidentally noted type 1 choledochal cyst, with no evidence \nof complication. No cholelithiasis or cholecystitis is present. \n---PRELIMINARY REPORT---\n\n# MRCP w\/ and w\/p ___\nAt the junction of the left hepatic duct, right anterior hepatic \nduct, right posterior hepatic duct there is bulbous dilatation \nof the origin of the common hepatic duct to 2.0 cm (TV) x 1.0 cm \n(AP) x 1.3 cm (CC) which is continuous with a common bile duct \nbulbous dilatation to 6.5 cm (TV) x 3.1 cm (AP) x 6.6 cm (CC).  \nThese findings are suggestive of a bilobed choledochal cyst, \ntype IV.  Within the common bile duct portion of this bilobed \ncholedochal cyst, there is a 3.8 cm (TV) x 1.7 cm (AP) x 3.7 cm \n(CC) lesion which is hypoinense to liver and pancreas on \nT1-weighted imaging, hyperintense on T2-weighted imaging, and \ndemonstrating enhancement as well as restricted diffusion, and \nsuggestive of a malignancy, likely cholangiocarcinoma.  This \nmass has a broad \nattachment to the posterior wall of the common bile duct with \nirregularity of the posterior aspect of the common bile duct \nwhich are concerning for invasion through the wall. At the \njunction of the IVC and left renal vein, no clear fat plane is \nidentified between this mass within the posterior aspect of the \ncommon bile duct and the left renal vein. A non-enhancing focus \nis noted in this mass and likely representative of necrosis \n(1003:76). \n  \nThe intrapancreatic portion of the common bile duct appears \nwithin normal \nlimits and the pancreatic duct is not clearly identified on this \nstudy. The liver is otherwise within normal limits.  There is \nconventional hepatic arterial anatomy.  The splenic, super \nmesenteric, main portal, and right and left portal veins are \npatent. \n  \nThe cystic duct inserts into the common bile duct portion of the \ncholedochal cyst. The gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, stomach, \nbilateral kidneys, bilateral adrenal glands are within normal \nlimits. There is no significant free fluid. There is no \nmesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. Bone marrow \nsignal is within normal limits. \n  \nIMPRESSION:  \n  Bilobed choledochal cyst involving the common hepatic duct and \nthe proximal common bile duct to the level of the pancreas.  \nWithin the common bile duct choledochal cyst is a 3.8 cm \nenhancing mass with restricted diffusion that is highly \nconcerning for cholangiocarcinoma. This mass has a broad \nattachment to the posterior wall of the common bile duct with \nirregularity of the posterior aspect of the common bile duct, \nwhich is concerning for invasion into and through the wall; \nparticularly at the junction of the IVC and left renal vein \nwhere no clear fat plane is identified between this mass within \nthe posterior aspect of the common bile duct and the left renal \nvein.  No lymphadenopathy or other lesions. \n  \nNo intrahepatic bile duct dilation with the tiny right and left \nhepatic ducts inserting into the dilated CHD.  Normal cystic \nduct caliber and normal appearance of the gallbladder. \n\nERCP report ___\nFindings: Esophagus: Limited exam of the esophagus was normal \nStomach: Limited exam of the stomach was normal \nDuodenum: Limited exam of the duodenum was normal \nMajor Papilla: Normal major papilla \nCannulation:  Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful and \ndeep with a sphincterotome using a free-hand technique. Contrast \nmedium was injected resulting in complete opacification.  \n \nFluoroscopic Interpretation of the Biliary Tree: The scout film \nwas normal. The bile duct was deeply cannulated with the \nsphincterotome. Contrast was injected and there was brisk flow \nthrough the ducts. Contrast extended to the entire biliary tree. \nThere was diffuse fusiform dilation of the CBD extending from \nthe distal CBD to the CHD in keeping with a possible Type I \ncholedochocele. The LHD was filled with contrast and appeared \nnormal. The RHD and IHBDs were not well visualized. There were \nno filling defects\/strictures seen. A biliary sphincterotomy was \nmade with a sphincterotome. There was no post-sphincterotomy \nbleeding. Excellent bile and contrast drainage was seen \nendoscopically and fluoroscopically.  \nProcedures: A sphincterotomy was performed in the 12 o'clock \nposition using a sphincterotome over an existing guidewire.\n\nSpyglass cholangioscopy was performed. Abnormal mucosa \ncharacterized by erythema, friability and vascularity was seen. \nThe appearance was concerning for malignancy.

On further eval, \nmost likely cause of presyncopal episode was dehydration in the \nsetting of bradycardia on a beta blocker. Patient was also found \nto have ___ on admission, with further workup revealing R \nkidney hydronephrosis not amenable to intervention.\n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\n===================\n[ ] Patient will need close monitoring of renal function by PCP \n___ 1 week of discharge, along with post-hospitalization \nfollow up. \n[ ] Her Keppra was dose-adjusted given her persistent ___. If \nher ___ improves or worsens, this will need to be dose-adjusted \nagain.\n[ ] If worsening renal function on next ___ check, will need \nurgent referral to ___ in ___ clinic to discuss long \nterm management of UPJ obstruction. Please call ___. \n[ ] Metoprolol was held given bradycardia during \nhospitalization. \n[ ] Glipizide was held given well-controlled A1c during \nhospitalization and risk of hypoglycemia.\n[ ] Patient is on aspirin- this medication was held during \nhospitalization and should not be restarted until discussion \nwith PCP.\n[ ] Lisinopril was held in the setting ___ during \nhospitalization.\n[ ] Follow up with neurologist Dr. ___ concern for \nseizures precipitating falls\/syncopal episodes \n[ ] Continue wearing compression stockings to improve possible \northostatic hypotension.\n[ ] follow up with GI or surgery as an outpatient given chronic, \nrecurrent volvulus. Communicated recommendation to PCP who can \nrefer as needed\n\nACUTE\/ACTIVE ISSUES\n==================\n# Acute kidney injury \nBaseline Cr 0.7-1.1, elevated to 1.8 in ED. Initially thought \nprerenal iso poor PO, but did not improve with fluids. Given \npossible falls recently, rhabdomyolysis was considered, but CK \nwas normal. SPEP was normal. There was also concern for possible \nintrinsic renal injury such as ATN given elevated urine Na, but \nno casts were seen on U\/A. Patient had renal ultrasound on ___ \nwhich showed grade 4 severe hydronephrosis of the R kidney and \nhypotrophic L kidney. Patient had no signs of pyelonephritis or \ninfection at the time. Patient underwent CT abdomen\/pelvis \nwithout contrast, with no obstructing stone seen, but did show \nacute on chronic large sigmoid volvulus with large bowel \nobstruction likely causing moderate-severe R hydronephrosis by \nmass effect. It is unclear if the hydronephrosis is acute or \nchronic, and whether volvulus is related. ___ likely in setting \nof unilateral hydronephrosis with hypotrophic L kidney. Urology \nand renal were consulted and patient underwent renal nuclear \nstudy on ___ to evaluate for UPJ obstruction and determine if \nrenal function was preserved. Scan showed partial obstruction at \nthe R UPJ, with decreased bilateral blood flow but essentially \nnormal L renal function. Given partial renal function and \ndiscussion with patient's healthcare proxy of the patient's \ngoals of care in the setting of her comorbidities and baseline \ndementia, urology team recommended attempting non-operative \ntreatment at this time as long as renal function remains \nrelatively stable. Patient will need renal function monitored \nclosely by her PCP given no plans for inpatient intervention at \nthis time. If renal function worsens in outpatient setting, \npatient should be urgently referred to ___ in ___ \n___ clinic to discuss long term management of UPJ \nobstruction. Patient's home lisinopril was held iso ___. \nDischarge Creatinine of 2.1.\n\n# Chronic large sigmoid volvulus, not actively obstructed \nPatient has history of large bowel obstruction presenting with \nsubtle symptoms and is also s\/p colectomy. Given history and \nconcern that patient unable to verbalize symptoms ___ baseline \ndementia, patient underwent abdominal X-ray on ___ which showed \nnonspecific non obstructive bowel gas pattern. Given R kidney \nhydronephrosis (as detailed above) obtained CT A\/P without \ncontrast that showed acute on chronic large sigmoid volvulus \nwith large bowel obstruction likely causing moderate-severe R \nhydronephrosis by mass effect. Reassuring as it is acute on \nchronic, imaging read as decreased compared to ___, and \npatient hemodynamically stable. ACS was consulted and was not \nconcerned for clinical obstruction, therefore recommend \noutpatient follow up and no need for emergent or urgent surgical \nintervention. GI was consulted and did not feel there is a role \nfor colonoscopy at this point and thought that the patient needs \neventual, non-urgent surgical intervention. Serial abdominal \nexams were monitored and reassuring. \n\n#Unresponsive episode\nPatient found to be unresponsive on ___ AM and was hypotensive \nto 70\/48, last seen normal 20 minutes prior. FSBG 142. Patient \nwas bolused IV fluids and SBP improved to 130s. After BP \nimproved, her mental status returned to baseline. Neuro exam at \nthis time was unremarkable, as was abdomen, cardiovascular and \nrespiratory exams. EKG revealed mild sinus bradycardia, \nunchanged from prior. VBG notable for elevated CO2 but likely in \nsetting decreased respiration during episode. CT head WO \ncontrast was without acute findings. 24-hour EEG was reassuring \nagainst seizure activity. Hypotension could be related to NPO \nstatus and initiation of low dose amlodipine, although would not \nexpect such a quick response to anti-hypertensive. On review of \nprevious notes and in talking to niece, patient does have \nhistory of possible orthostasis as well as autonomic \ndysfunction, and niece notes several of these similar \nunresponsive episodes at home over the past few months. \nOrthostatic vital signs were positive but did not correct with \nfluid resuscitation and therefore think patient may have some \nunderlying autonomic instability leading to these episodes. Also \nconcern for possible non-convulsive seizure vs post-ictal state \n(which could also lead to autonomic dysfunction) given patient \nhas history of seizures. Patient did not have any incontinence \nor tongue biting. Obtained 24hour EEG which was unremarkable. Of \nnote, her Keppra was dose-adjusted given her persistent ___ and \nthis will need to be monitored as an outpatient. Patient has \nscheduled follow up with neurologist.\n\n# Near fall at home, concern for presyncope\n# History of vasovagal syncope \nPatient presents after a third episode of presyncope. Likely \netiology is combination of dehydration in patient with \nbradycardia on beta blocker. Neurology was consulted in ED and \nmentioned a well-documented h\/o vasovagal\/neurocardio syncope \nbut unclear where this has been documented. Despite seizure hx, \nneuro not concerned for seizure as etiology (previous seizures \nhave occurred iso acute illness eg volvulus\/infection). Unlikely \ninfection given no leukocytosis, afebrile, negative U\/A. \nOrthostatics in ED were reportedly negative. Patient not \nhypoglycemic on admission, although patient is on a sulfonylurea \nso higher risk of low sugars. Patient noted bradycardic with HR \nin ___ on metoprolol, so may have contributed to presentation. \nNo PR prolongation or e\/o heart block on EKG. Last TTE was \n___, had LVEF 30%. Troponin negative. Also was some \nconcern for hypothyroidism given patient always turns AC off per \nniece, but TSH normal. No chest pain or hypoxia to suspect PE. \nPatient at baseline mental status per niece. Patient was \nmonitored on telemetry during stay. TTE was not repeated because \nthought unlikely to be high yield given no murmur on exam. \nPatient's home metoprolol was held as below. \n\n# Bradycardia - NSR in ___, concern for possible symptomatic \nbradycardia as above. No PR prolongation or e\/o heart block on \nEKG. Trop negative, TSH normal. Patient was monitored on tele. \nHome metoprolol was held as patient was likely symptomatic from \nbradycardia. Plan to hold on discharge for patient to discuss \nwith PCP. HR has been stable in 50-60s. \n\n# Hypertension \nPatient hypertensive to 220\/90 upon arrival to the floor, has \nintermittently been so throughout prior admissions. Likely not \nacute, will plan to only lower by ~20% to SBPs 160-170s. IV \nhydralazine 10 x1 with subsequent drop to 90\/50s. Patient's goal \nBP while inpatient was 160-170s\/90s. Home lisinopril 40mg qd was \nheld iso ___. As per above, she was briefly trialed on \nAmlodipine 5mg but the patient became subsequently hypotensive - \nas such, this was discontinued. If remains hypertensive at PCP \nfollow up, consider reinitiation of an anti-hypertensive.\n\nCHRONIC ISSUES: \n=============== \n# Normocytic anemia: Hb 9.2 on admission, at prior baseline. No \nevidence of bleeding. CBC was trended daily and an active T&S \nwas maintained.\n\n# Dementia: At baseline per niece. Patient oriented only to \nself.

Stridor: Initially unclear cause of his stridor given normal \nlaryngoscope on last visit. Pt intubated on admission and \nstabilized on vent. CT scan of the neck did not show any \nextraluminal masses compressing. ___ an attempt was made to \nextubate him, but he afterwards developed stridor and had to be \nre-intubated. During the brief extubation, a laryngoscopy was \ndone that was concerning for at least partial paralysis of the \nvocal cords. He was treated with 24 hours of IV solumedrol in \ncase there was a contribution of airway swelling. ___ he had a \ntracheostomy placed by the ENT service with some difficulty \nbecause of his severe scoliosis and altered anatomy. Afterwards \nhe was quickly weaned to a trach collar. With the concomitant \ndysphagia, there was concern for neuromuscular weakness, so \nneurology was consulted.

She had a ___ \nsecond pause in P-wave conductin without ventricular escape \nbeats before transfer to ___. Upon transfer patient was found \nto be in normal sinus rhythm. During her hospitalization she had \ntwo episodes of heartblock, Mobitz II. She did not develop any \nsymptoms of syncope or pre-syncope, chest pain, or shortness of \nbreath. Beta blockers and other nodal agents were avoided. \nPacemaker placement was deferred in the setting of active \ninfection (being treated for pneumonia) the patient's age, and \ngoals of care. She is being discharged with plan for an event \nmonitor and will re-evaluate for pacemaker placement as an \noutpatient once she has cleared her active infection. \n\n# Hypoxemia: \n# Pulmonary edema:\n# Acute on Chronic Heart Failure Exacerbation:   \nPatient presented with a new oxygen requirement up to 4L NC from \nroom air prior to her procedure. She had crackles on exam \nincluding pulmonary edema on CXR. Patient did not have a history \nof known heart failure so it was thought that she flashed in \nsetting of increased IVF and episode of a-fib with RVR after her \nprocedure at ___. Workup at ___ included a proBNP \nof >5000s, and a TTE that showed a depressed LVEF of 40% with \nregional systolic dysfunctdion c\/w CAD (PDA distribution) and \nmoderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation. She was \naggressively diuresed with IV Lasix and subsequently able to \nreduce her oxygen requirement to her baseline of room air. \nRepeat proBNP was 2100 from 5000s. She was transitioned to PO \nTorsemide prior to discharge. Patient was started on Lisinopril \nand Amlodipine for afterload reduction.    \n\n# Hospital Acquired Pneumonia:  \nPrior to transfer from ___, patient developed a \nfever, leukocytosis, new cough, and new oxygen requirement in \nthe post-operative setting. A L basilar opacity was noted on \nchest Xray concerning for hospital acquired pneumonia. Upon \narrival to ___, the patient was started empirically on \nCeftazidime and Vancomycin. Blood cultures and urine cultures \nwere negative. While on antibiotics, the patient's leukocytosis \ntrended down to normal, she remained afebrile, and she \nclinically improved. MRSA swab was negative so Vancomycin was \ndiscontinued. She was then transitioned to PO Levofloxacin prior \nto discharge. The antibiotic course will be completed on ___.  \n\n# CAD: \nDuring workup for pulmonary edema a TTE was performed and showed \na depressed LVEF of 40% with regional systolic dysfunctdion c\/w \nCAD (PDA distribution) and moderate to severe (3+) mitral \nregurgitation with reduced ejection fraction. Due to the \nevidence of CAD on echo she was started on Atorvastatin 40mg and \nASA 81mg. A beta blocker was not started due to her heart block \nas described above. She will follow-up with cardiology as an \noutpatient to determine whether a cath is within her goals of \ncare. \n\n# Hypertension:  \n - Discontinued home carvedilol in the setting of high-grade \nheart block.   \n - Held home valsartan 80 mg PO BID   \n - Started Lisinopril 10mg QDAY on  \n - Started Amlodipine 5mg QDAY on \n\n# S\/p spinal surgery: Pain was well controlled with Tylenol. Per \nher surgeon, Dr. ___ anticoagulation is okay to \nstart on POD ___. His number is ___. The patient \nwas on standard spine precautions with no deep bending or \ntwisting, no lifting greater than 5 lbs. Physical therapy worked \nwith the patient and recommended discharge to rehab. \n\n# AMS: On arrival to ___ the patient was lethargic and \noriented only to person, which was significantly changed from \nher baseline. Her AMS was likely due to infection, hypoxemia \nfrom pulmonary edema, and pain from surgery. The patient's \nunderlying conditions were treated as detailed above and she \nsignificantly improved. Prior to discharge the patient was alert \nand oriented, conversational, and had returned to her baseline \naccording to her family. \n\n# Asthma   \n - Continued Ipratroprium Q6H PRN  \n - Continued Albuterol 2 PUFF q6H PRN  \n\n # Hypothyroidism:  \n - Continued home levothyroxine 50 mcg daily  \n\n # Back pain:  \n - Continued home gabapentin 200 mg PO qHS  \n\n # GERD:  \n - Continued home omeprazole 20 mg PO daily  \n\n====================\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES: \n====================\nMEDICATIONS CHANGED, ADDED, or DISCONTINUED: \n[] Lisinopril 10mg DAILY started for afterload reduction and BP \ncontrol\n[] Amlodipine 5mg started for blood pressure control \n[] Torsemide 10mg every other day started for diuresis in \nsetting of CHF\n[] Potassium Chloride 10meq Daily STARTED. \n\n[] Valsartan 80mg BID, held during hospitalization, consider \nre-continuing once electrolytes and blood pressures stable as \noutpatient \n\n[] Carvedilol. Discontinued, patient should not be on nodal \nagents or beta blockers due to heart block \n\n[] DO NOT start beta blockers or nodal agents due to concern for \nhigh grade Mobitz II heart block. \n\nITEMS REQUIRING FOLLOW-UP: \n[] The patient has required significant potassium and magnesium \nrepletion during diuresis.

You were treated with Vancomycin for possible line infection. Your blood cultures are no growth on discharge and we feel a line infection is less likely. We will follow your blood cultures to ensure they are negative and call your dialysis if they become positive. Your heart markers were mildly elevated - most likely due to volume overload and renal failure. You had an ECHO which showed no change to suggest a heart attack. Your INR was high on admission consequently we have held your coumadin. Re-start your coumadin on ___ and have your level checked at dialysis on ___. Have the results forwarded to the ___ clinic who can make adjustments as needed. Attend your regular dialysis session tomorrow."}

An adherent blood clot was noted \nat this area with erythema surrounding the ulcer. (thermal \ntherapy)\nNo ulceration\/bleeding was noted in the deuodenum. Metal stent \narising from the ampulla appeared to be filled with food debris. \nPost ampullary investigation was normal.\nOtherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum\n\nERCP ___\nSmall amount of old blood in the stomach cardia\/fundus \ncompatible with the previously noted ___ ulcer that was \ntreated with cautery. \nThe previous fully covered metal biliary stent was found at the \nmajor papilla having migrated slightly distally into the \nduodenum. \nThis appeared to be occluded by stone debris, and there was \nmalignant-appearing ampullary tissue around the stent. \nGiven the concern for cholangitis, the decision was made to \nremove the metal biliary stent. \nThe previous fully covered metal stent in the biliary duct was \nremoved from the major papilla. \nLimited cholangiogram was performed given the current \ncholangitis. \nFilling defects that appeared like sludge and stone debris were \nseen in the common bile duct. \nMultiple balloon sweeps were performed of the biliary duct with \nremoval of pus, sludge, and stone debris successfully. \nA 10mm x 60mm WallFlex Biliary RX fully covered metal stent was \nplaced successfully in the common bile duct. \nAfter placement it appeared that the distal end of the stent was \nat the level of the ampulla and not completely crossing the \nampullary tissue, so the decision was made to place another \nstent below that crossing the ampulla. \nA 10mm x 40mm WallFlex Biliary RX fully covered metal stent \n(Ref: ___, ___ was placed successfully in the common \nbile duct and across the ampulla.\n\n___ EGD\nImpression:\nMedium hiatal hernia. Many small diffuse angioectasias in the \nantrum and duodenal bulb, likely radiation-induced mucosal \nchanges. Single spot of heme from one angioectasia in the \nstomach antrum, suggesting this as the source of the patient's \nGI bleeding. APC was applied for hemostasis successfully. \nErythema, granularity and congestion of the mucosa in the second \npart of the duodenum. Previous metal stent at the ampulla, with \na small ulceration of the tumor alongside the metal stent. Small \nspot of heme at this area, suggesting this as the source of the \npatient's GI bleeding. APC was applied for hemostasis \nsuccessfully. On withdrawal, a small ___ Tear was \nnoted at the hiatal narrowing, with a small amount of fresh \nblood. There was no active bleeding from the tear, so no therapy \nwas necessary. Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the \nduodenum.\n\nSuccessful EGD with identification and treatment of 2 possible \netiologies for the patient's GI bleeding: ulceration at the \ntumor alongside the indwelling metal stent, and an angioectasia \nin the stomach antrum. The ___ Tear was unlikely to be \nthe source of the patient's GI bleeding.\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ w\/ h\/o Stage IIB ampullary adenocarcinoma w\/local \nmetastases, h\/o class A cirrhosis, \nesophagitis\/gastritis\/duodenitis without prior varices, who \npresents with melena and Hct of 15.\n\n# UGIB: Presenting with melena, hemodynamically stable during \nhospital stay - on admission he was thought to be most likely \nbleeding from ampullary cancer.

On last admission, \nthere was also concern raised of possibility of pseudoaneurysm \naround head of pancreas which could be source of bleeding as \nwell. Patient was transfused a total of 3u prbcs during his ICU \nstay and appropriately corrected. He was transferred to the \nfloor where he remained hemodynamically stable with no further \nepisodes of melena. He was maintained on PPI BID during hospital \nstay. EGD with duodenoscope showed 2 possible etiologies for the \npatient's GI bleeding: ulceration at the tumor alongside the \nindwelling metal stent, and an angioectasia in the stomach \nantrum. The ___ Tear was unlikely to be the source of \nthe patient's GI bleeding. The patient's Hct was monitored \npost-procedure and was noted to have a slow progressive drop in \nhis Hct. He remained asymptomatic with no further symptoms and \nwas transfused 2 units prior to discharge.

The patient intermittently required a small dose of \nphenylephrine. Blood cultures grew E coli (resistant to early \ngeneration beta lactams) and enterococcus (not VRE). She was on \nempiric vanc\/Zosyn since ___, which has now been narrowed to \nvanc\/CTX based on sensitivities. Her urine culture was negative \nand her CT showed no obvious biliary pathology. The perc biliary \ndrain has been uncapped for external drainage in the setting of \npossible cholangitis and the patient improved. On transfer to \nthe medical floor,the patient's antibiotics were narrowed to \nCipro\/Ampicllin. She subsequently developed renal failure \nthought to be due to betalactams so Vancomycin was restarted.  \nUnfortunately, she developed recurrent lft and bilirubin \nelevation, and underwent repeat PTBD placed on ___, with \nsubsequent improvement.  She was discharged to complete a 2 week \ncourse of ciprofloxacin and ampicillin (ampicillin was restarted \nas likelihood of AIN was quite low per nephrology, with ATN more \nlikely).\n\n#PANCREATIC ADENOCARCINOMA \n#Malignant biliary obstruction. \nDiagnosed ___ by EUS\/FNA.

She was followed by interventional \nradiology and had placement of metal stent on ___ with \nremoval of external PTBD, and then replacement after she \ndeveloped recurrent obstruction as described above.  She will \nhave ___ follow up next week for repeat stent evaluation to try \nto clarify reason for rapid failure of stent.\n\n#ACUTE RENAL FAILURE\nThe patient developed acute renal failure. She was seen by \nnephrology who felt her renal failure was likely due to either \nAIN in the setting of antibiotics or ATN from sepsis.  Her renal \nfunction slowly improved, but plateaued at approximately 2.

She also had 3 events in the\nemergency department, two of which were characterized by \nrigidity\nwith some bilateral arm movement, lasting 30 seconds. There was\nno apparent postictal period, no oral trauma, and no bowel or\nbladder incontinence.  The last episode consisted of 30 seconds\nof staring into space, which resolved.  It also appears that she\nhad withdrawal to light shining in her eyes during 1 of these\nepisodes.  She did receive 2 mg IV Ativan for these episodes.\nWork-up included positive cocaine in urine.\n\nPlan initially was to admit for EEG, but hospitalist declined, \nas\nhe felt that cvEEG would be more appropriate. Therefore, patient\nwas transferred to ___.\n\nWith regards to her seizure history, patient reports that she\nbegan having seizures 3 months ago, with no clear trigger.

She has had only one episode of urinary incontinence\nwith a seizure and no episodes of tongue bite.  She also has\nnever had any seizures at work, and only seems to have seizures\nat home.\n\nPer the neurology consult note, patient has been admitted\nrecently in early ___ to ___, after presenting with\nclaims of being sexually assaulted.  In the ED, she had 3\nreported generalized tonic-clonic seizures, each lasting about \n30\nseconds.  At that time, her toxicology screen was positive for\nbuprenorphine, cocaine, and cannabinoids, and blood alcohol \nlevel\nwas 226.  During that hospitalization, patient had to be\nintubated for agitation post-Ativan.  Workup included a head CT\n(normal) and a 20-minute EEG which was normal, but did not\ncapture any events.  She was evaluated by neurology at that \ntime,\nand they increased her lamotrigine to 100 mg twice a day. \n\nIt appears that the neurology consult team thought that it was\nlikely that at least some of the seizures could be in the \nsetting\nof substance use, and that some episodes were also likely to be\nnonepileptic.  \n\nOf note, it is somewhat unclear what AEDs patient is supposed to\nbe taking.

She also had 3 events in the ___ \n___ emergency department, two of which were characterized \nby rigidity with some bilateral arm movement, lasting 30 \nseconds. There was no apparent postictal period, no oral trauma, \nand no bowel or bladder incontinence. The last episode consisted \nof 30 seconds of staring into space, which resolved. It also \nappears that she had withdrawal to light shining in her eyes \nduring 1 of these episodes. She did receive 2 mg IV Ativan for \nthese episodes.

Today at 1500, pt developed \"racing heart with \nflutters and some palpitations\", then, suddently, almost blacked \nout for 5 seconds. This episode described as warmth, blackness, \nno LOC although he is not completely sure. This episode resolved \nafter 5 seconds and he was still sitting down.  \n\nOver course of afternoon, palpitations got worse, called PA at \noffice, was told to go to ___ EKG, which he did. \nHe left the facility, felt worsening palpitations, called and \nwas told to go to ED.

As INR subtherapeutic and \nprocedure was initially being considered, patient was started on \nheparin gttWe consulted EP in morning after the patient was \nadmitted.  Their recommendation was to medically manage with \nsotalol and serial EKGs to monitor for prolonged QT.  We \ntherefore discontinued the diltiazem gtt in the setting of \nbrady-arrhythmias on telemetry.  The patient remained \nasymptomatic throughout this hospitalization.  We continued home \nwarfarin and closely followed ___.  The patient was \nstarted on 80mg BID of sotalol, monitored for QT prolongation \n(QTc's of 0.47-0.48), which were WNL and on the morning of \ndischarge the patient's dose was escalated to 120mg BID, and \nagain monitored for QT prolongation; QTc prior to discharge was \n0.46. \n.\n# CORONARIES: The patient has no known history of \nhyperlipidemia.  We continued the patient on his home dose of \naspirin.  \n. \n# PUMP: The patient has mildly depressed systolic function on \nlast echocardiogram.  We continued the patient on his home dose \nof lisinopril. We initially held the patient's metoprolol in the \nsetting of diltiazem gtt.  The diltiazem drip was discontinued \nafter roughly 8 hours in order to begin rate control therapy \nwith sotalol.   \n. \n# HYPERTENSION: Continue home lisinopril. Holding metoprolol in \nthe setting of sotalol.  Given the patient's borderline \nbradycardia, we held the metoprolol at discharge, with the \npatient to follow up with his cardiologist about possibly \nrestarting the metoprolol in the future.\n.\n[]TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\n-patient discharged with holter monitor\n-patient will f\/u with Dr. ___ \n \n___ on Admission:\nPreadmission medications listed are correct and complete.  \nInformation was obtained from Patient.\n1.

MRI of the C-spine and \nT-spine did not demonstrate any evidence of cord compression or \nother structural abnormality to account for these symptoms. \nAdditionally, he reported persistent change in his voice and \ndifficulty swallowing liquids after being attacked and struck on \nhis neck. The patient was not noted by staff to be aspirating \nliquids or solids during his stay. The patient remained \nconcerned over the presence of a lumbar vertebral fracture. We \noffered to evaluate the lumbar spine with plain films, given his \nhistory of chronic low back pain exacerbated in the setting of \nrecent assault, but he declined as he felt the team would not \nchange their opinions. Of note, he became agitated and \naggressive towards staff when we refused to provide a \nprescription for narcotic pain medication upon discharge. \n\n# Drug seeking behavior\nThis decision to attempt to avoid narcotic medications was aided \nby discussion with his PCP (Dr. ___ at ___ \n___) who reported that he had previously sought out \nadditional narcotic pain medications following the amputation of \nhis toe on the right foot (___). She reports that he \nuntruthfully claimed to have not been given any pain medication \nupon discharge following this surgery in ___, and so she \nprescribed a small number of narcotic pain pills. She later \nreceived a call from his pharmacy, stating that he had in fact \nreceived narcotics from his surgeon, and had attempted to fill \nher prescription as well. This account, coupled with his \nbehavior surrounding this issue, raised concerns for \ndrug-seeking behavior on this admission. Additionally, he admits \nto using 3+ different pharmacies, and has multiple PCP's who he \nhas seen over the last year. During the admission process, in \nattempting to reconcile his home medications, we received \nmultiple very different lists of current medications from the \npatient, his multiple pharmacies, and his PCP of record, Dr. \n___. As a result, it was very difficult to reconcile his \nmedications, and the final list is correct to the best of our \nknowledge. He was discharged with a prescription for Ultram for \ncontrol of back pain s\/p assault. \n\n# Hypertension: Well controlled on this admission. He was \ncontinued on his home regimen of labetalol. \n\n# HLD: Stable. Restarted home regimen on discharge. \n \n# Diabetes: Blood glucose was well controlled on this admission. \nHe was restarted on his home insulin regimen upon discharge.\n \nMedications on Admission:\nUnable to obtain information regarding preadmission medication \nat this time.

Patient's orthostatics exam was equivocal in the ED and \nnegative on the medicine floor and 2L normal saline. Her UTI may \nhave also contributed.  This is unlikely to be cardiac in \netiology (ACS, valvular abnormalites, arrhythmia) given absence \nof clinical systems, normal cardiac exam, normal EKG, and normal \ntelemetry overnight. There was low suspicion for seizure \nactivity given no evidence of postictal state or witnessed \nconvulsive activity. Electrolytes and BS were within normal \nrange. There was no trigger to suggest a vasovagal response. She \nreceived IVFs overnight and encouraged to take PO.

She described losing her step \nupon getting out of bed, and had symptoms of lightheadedness at \nthe time. She denied any loss of consciousness. For her \northostatic hypotension, patient at baseline is on midodrine. It \nis possible that ___ midodrine in combination with her \nbeta blocker and lisinopril is contributing to her orthostatic \nhypotension. Patient is on chronic pred 5mg for PMR and there \nwas initially a concern for possible adrenal insufficiency but \nthis was ruled out (see below for more information). Patient \nalso has peripheral neuropathy, and poor ambulatory function at \nbaseline, both of which causes her gait to be unsteady as well. \nPatient denied any prior history of sudden LOC to suggest \ncardiac etiology. She also denied any palpitations or chest \nsymptoms. She was monitored on tele without any notable cardiac \nevents. Patient has a history of AF but remained in SR while she \nwas hospitalized. There was no physical exam findings to suggest \naortic stenosis. Hence, overall there is a low suspicion for \nstructural heart disease. She denied any prior seizure history \nand was not post-ictal after her fall. ___ BP was in \n120s-140s\/60s-70s prior to discharge and she was not \northostatic. All together, we believe patient suffered a fall in \nthe setting of being on midodrine, and antihypertensives \n(lisinopril, metoprolol), in combination with poor \nbalance\/peripheral neuropathy at baseline. Patient was continued \non home midodrine on discharge, and after a discussion with her \nPCP, ___ lisinopril was discontinued and metoprolol \ndecreased to 25mg XL daily. Patient will follow-up with PCP to \ndetermine whether she should have any other adjustments to her \nmedication doses.\n\n#R\/o adrenal insufficiency: Patient is on chronic pred 5mg for \nPMR, and in the process of working up for her fall, an AM \ncortisol returned at 1.1. This was likely artifact. We obtained \na repeat cortisol, which returned as 15 and is more consistent \nwith prior cortisol levels in our system. This repeat cortisol \nlevel was also drawn at a more appropriate time of the day. \nGiven that patient did not have any orthostasis, without sodium \nor glucose abnormalities, and absence of other adrenal \ninsufficiency symptoms, this level is likely a laboratory error. \nPatient was able to ambulate without any dizziness or other \nsymptoms. This questionable cortisol result was communicated \nwith outpatient PCP via phone call, who agreed that it is likely \na non-issue. We continued patient back on home prednisone for \nher PMR upon discharge. \n\n#Acute blood loss anemia: Patient developed acute blood loss \nanemia in the setting of her fall and developing a large R flank \nhematoma. Hgb on discharge was 7.6 (baseline ___. She did \nnot have any active evidence of bleeding on discharge, and her \nCT did not show any active extravasation. Patient will follow-up \nwith her PCP, and should have her CBC repeated as an outpatient.\n\n#R flank\/extrathoracic hematoma: Patient suffered a fall and \ndeveloped a large R flank hematoma. A CT scan showed the \nflank\/extrathoracic hematoma was 18 x 12 x 4.3cm without any \nevidence of active extravasation. This was progressively \nresolving and improved at the time discharge. \n\n#L radial fracture, R midshaft clavicle fracture: Patient with \nfractures from prior fall in ___ and is s\/p by ortho. Per \northo, ___ fractures are healing well and is best managed \nnon-operatively. Per ortho, patient can be WBAT for LUE and RUE. \nShe will follow-up in outpatient orthopedics clinic. \n\n#PMR: ___ PMR was stable during this inpatient \nhospitalization. We continued ___ home prednisone on \ndischarge. \n\n#DMII: Patient was treated with ISS while inpatient with sugar \nlevels remaining largely at goal. She was resumed on her \noutpatient DM regimen upon discharge.\n\n#GERD: We continued patient on home omeprazole.\n\n===============================================================\nTransitional Issues:\n1. Please follow-up on ___ orthostatic hypotension. After \ndiscussing with her primary care physician, ___ \ndiscontinued her lisinopril, decreased her metoprolol to 25mg XL \ndaily and continued her home midodrine.\n2. Please follow-up on her acute blood loss anemia and repeat \nCBC during primary care appointment. Hgb on discharge was 7.6. \n3. Please follow-up regarding her ACTH level (pending on \ndischarge). Note that this was sent due to low cortisol (1.1), \nbut the 1.1 was likely a lab error as the repeat cortisol level \nwas 15. \n4. Please follow-up regarding the healing of her L radial and R \nclavicle fractures. \n\n# CODE: Full Code \n# CONTACT: Daughter, ___ ___ \n\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

There \nis a small possibility this was the precipitating factor in his \nhemolytic anemia therefore if patient requires diuresis upon \ndischarge would either use ethacrynic acid or monitor counts \nwith resumption of Torsemide. \n-Discharge Weight 85kg (dry weight). \n-Either resume diuresis with ethaycrynic acid or monitor for \nrecurrent hemolytic anemia if using sulfa-based loop diuretic \n-Will need cardiology f\/u \n-Hematology f\/u (they will call patient)\n\n#Bilateral Lower Leg Weakness\n#Polyradiculopathy\n#Falls\/unsteady gait\n#Concern for Myelopathy\/myositis \nNeurology and neurosurgery both consulted per neurology \nassessment\n\nNeurological examination revealed diffuse, distally-predominant\nlower extremity weakness, decreased reflexes except at the left\npatella, and pan-modal sensory deficits in the distal lower\nextremities. MRI of the spine demonstrated multi-level\ndegenerative disc disease associated with severe canal and\nforaminal stenosis in the lumbar spine. Serum studies have been\nnotable for hematological abnormalities, elevated inflammatory\nmarkers, and elevated CK and LFTs that are tending toward \nnormal.\n\nThe degenerative changes in the lumbosacral spine could \ncertainly\nbe playing a prominent role in the lower extremity weakness. The\nquickly and spontaneously normalizing CKs (even while on a\nstatin) seem to point away from a primary muscle process (e.g.\ninclusion body myositis). \n \nNEUROLOGY RECOMMENDATIONS:\n- follow clinically\n- nerve conduction studies\/electromyography could be helpful, \nand\nmay be done on an outpatient basis (will be arranged by \nneurology)\n- obtain bilateral ankle-foot orthotics \n- fall precautions\n- rehab\n- Neurosurgery consulted recommended lumbar decompression \npreviously recommended at ___, is quite certain he does \nnot want surgical intervention at this time.

They felt this is likely from known lumbar degenerative disease but there are other rarer possibilities still on the table. They would like to see you in neurology clinic.

Pt \ngot a CXR and CT that showed Tree and ___ opacities. Pulmonology \nwas consulted and they decided that the most likely diagnosis is \npneumonia due to aspiration due to hx of GERD. They discussed \nlifestyle modifications with him (small meals, not eating before \nbed, raising head of bed). Patient got azithromycin and \nceftriaxone in the hospital, discharged on levofloxacin for at \ntotal of 7 days of antibiotics. He initially required 3L of O2 \nby nasal cannula but on discharge spo2 was 92-93% at rest and \nwhile ambulating on RA without symptoms of dyspnea. We continued \nto treat his hypertension and GERD with his home medications. Of \nnote, patient also appeared to have a UTI on admission based on \nresults of his UA which showed leuk esterase, WBCs, bacteria, \nand RBCs (however was asx and culture was negative).

Reassuring that he denies any other\nconstitutional symptoms such as fevers, nightsweats. No\nlymphadenopathy appreciated. LDH elevated at 271. Most likely \n___ to pneumonia. Recommend it is followed up and if weight loss \ncontinues then undergo further workup in outpatient setting.\n\n#Proteinuria\/bacteruria\nPatient had +leuk, protein, bacteria, and WBCs in urine at time \nof admission. Culture was negative but if sample was from after \npatient received ceftriaxone then we would expect a negative \nculture. Repeat UA showed small leuk esterase, 15 WBCs, and 8 \nRBCS which is significantly better than his prior UA. Presuming \npt had a UTI that is improving with ceftriaxone.

No clinically significant valvular disease. \nModerate pulmonary artery systolic pressure.  \n\n___ EGD\nFindings: Esophagus:  \n Excavated Lesions A single non-bleeding 9 mm clean base ulcer \nwith white exudates on top from prior banding was found in the \nlower third of the esophagus .  \n Other No evidence of Barretts ro active bleeding was identified \n \nStomach:  \n Contents: White liquid fluid was seen in the entire stomach. A \nhemoclip was found in the fundus. where the Dielofoy lesion was \nidentified. No active signs of bleeding  \n Mucosa: Localized discontinuous mosaic appearance of the mucosa \nwith no bleeding was noted in the stomach body. These findings \nare compatible with mild portal gastropathy.  \n Other No evidence of active bleeding, ulcers or polyps  \nDuodenum:  \n Protruding Lesions A sub-mucosal non-bleeding 1.5 cm mass of \nbenign appearance was found at the second part of the duodenum. \nThe scope traversed the lesion.  \n Other No active bleeding was identified in the duodenum  \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ year old woman with ETOH, HCV cirrhosis, actively drinking \nETOH with evidence of Alcoholic hepatitis on labs who presented \nwith hematemesis and melena, s\/p banding grade 3 esophageal \nvarices and dieulafoy clipping. Patient was admitted to ICU for \nUGIB.  Following EGD patient remained hemodynamically stable, \nwas sucessfully extubated and was transferred to medical floor. \n\n# Upper GI bleeding: Patient presented with UGIB.  Received a \ntotal of 3 units pRBCs and FFP at OSH.  Bleeding resolved after \ndieulafoy clipping and variceal banding.  TIPS is an option \nshould bleeding recur. Hct has been stable since \nclipping\/banding. Patient was continued on octreotide gtt for 72 \nhours after bleeding stopped. She received protonix 40 mg IV \nBID.  She was started on ceftriaxone 1 g Q24 for 5 days after \nbleed for SBP prophylaxis.  Patient was started on carafate \nslurry and nadolol 48 hrs after cessation of bleeding.  She \nremained hemodynamically stable and was called out to medicine \nfloor where she had no recurrence of her bleed. She was \ndischarged on a PPI, nadolol and a fourteen day course of \ncarafate.   \n \n#  Encephalopathy: Etiology likely hepatic encephalopathy \ntriggered by GI bleed or Alcoholic Hepatitis although could be \nmedication effect vs UTI.  No evidence of PVT\/Budd Chiari or \nliver mass on RUQ US. Mental status improved with extubation and \nlactulose.  Patient was continued on lactulose and rifaxaimin \nwith improvement in encephalopathy. She was oriented, \nappropriate and without asterixis at discharge.  \n\n# Alcoholic Hepatitis: Patient was actively drinking leading up \nto this admission and labs show evidence of Alcoholic Hep with \nelevated AST, Tbili, INR. Following extubation, encouraged \naggressive nutrition with Dobhoff tube but patient refused so \nshe was encouraged to drink six Ensures a day in addition to her \nregular meals. Pentoxyfylline was started and her liver enzymes \ninitially continued to trend up with discriminant factors > 50. \nRepeat EGD was performed to determine whether it would be safe \nto start steroids but this showed prominent ulceration and \ngastropathy that seemed susceptible to bleeding so steroids were \nnot started. At discharge her LFTs were stabilizing so she was \ndischarged on a 28 day course of pentoxyfylline. She was \nencouraged to follow-up with her outpatient hepatologist. Social \nwork and the team expressed to her the importance of abstaining \nfrom alcohol and entering relapse prevention. \n\n# Decompensated cirrhosis with encephalopathy: MELD is 22. \nSecondary to ETOH and untreated hepatitis C. Viral load was \n88,000 and genotype was pending at discharge. Patient continued \non lactulose, rifaxamin, nadolol as above.  \n\n# ETOH abuse: Patient had withdrawal at OSH treated with IV \ndiazepam.  She was intubated on arrival as she was \nobtuned\/required airway protection prior to procedures.  Patient \nwas continued on CIWA scale, but this was discontinued in ICU as \nshe had no further withdrawal symptoms.  Patient was continued \non multivitamin, thiamine, folate.  Social work was consulted \nand patient was given information regarding relapse prevention. \n.\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES\n- Patient will require EUS to biopsy submucosal mass in the \nduodenum found on repeat EGD\n- HCV genotype was pending at discharge\n \nMedications on Admission:\nMedications home: \nNabumetone\n\nMedications on transfer:\nOcretotide drip\nPantoprazole drip\nCeftriaxone\n\n \nDischarge Medications:\n1.

We performed an EGD that isolated and treated the source of bleeding. You were transferred out to the medicine floor, where we continued treating your liver disease. Your bilirubin continued to rise and we started a medicine called pentoxyphylline to decrease the inflammation in the liver which you will need to continue taking for the next month. This inflammation was due to your recent alcohol use. A repeat endoscopy showed no active bleeding but you still have ulcers that are very susceptible to bleeding. As our team and our social worker discussed with you, you must refrain from any future alcohol intake, otherwise you will get even more sick and may even die. Since you refused to have a feeding tube placed, please remember to try to drink ___ Ensures a day to help with your nutrition as this will also help your liver heal.

Mild cardiomegaly is re- \ndemonstrated.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged with \ndense atherosclerotic calcification of the aortic knob noted. \nMild pulmonary vascular congestion is similar compared to the \nprior study. More focal patchy opacity in the retrocardiac \nregion could reflect an area of atelectasis though infection is \nnot completely excluded. No large pleural effusion or \npneumothorax is identified.  Marked degenerative changes of both \nacromioclavicular joints are seen. High riding right humeral \nhead suggests underlying rotator cuff disease. Remote right \neighth rib fracture is again seen. \n  \nImpression: Mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Retrocardiac \nopacity likely reflects atelectasis but infection is not \nexcluded in the correct clinical setting. \n\n***************\nCXR ___\n**************\nFINDINGS:  \n  \nPediatric sternal wires are present. A prosthetic cardiac valve \nis unchanged in configuration.  The heart size is top-normal.  \nThe aortic arch is moderately calcified.  There is no \npneumothorax or pleural effusion.  The central pulmonary vessels \nare prominent, without edema or congestion. \n  \nThere persistent left retrocardiac opacity is again seen, \nslightly more \nexaggerated on the current examination due to lower lung \nvolumes, likely reflecting atelectasis, although underlying \nconsolidation cannot be entirely excluded. \n  \nIMPRESSION:  \n  \nMinimal change since the ___ chest radiograph. \nPersistent left \nretrocardiac opacity is difficult to differentiate between \natelectasis and small consolidation. \n\n***************\nCXR ___\n***************\n\nFINDINGS:  \n  \nThe chin obscures the right apex. The heart is mildly enlarged.  \nThe hilar and mediastinal contour course are unchanged.  \nPediatric sternal wires and a cardiac valve are unchanged in \norientation. There is new pulmonary vascular congestion with \nmild edema and new small bilateral pleural effusions. \n  \nIMPRESSION:  \n  \nNew pulmonary vascular congestion and mild pulmonary edema, with \nnew small bilateral pleural effusions. \n\n***************\n___ ___\n***************\n\nFindings:  \n  \nSome of the images were repeated due to motion artifact. There \nis no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage, edema, mass \neffect, or large vascular territorial infarction. Mildly \nprominent ventricles and sulci are likely secondary to age \nrelated atrophy. Periventricular, deep, and subcortical white \nmatter hypodensities, extensive but grossly unchanged, are \nlikely sequela of chronic small vessel ischemic disease in a \npatient of this age. \n  \nRight maxillary sinus is atelectatic and completely opacified. \nThere is mild mucosal thickening within the left maxillary \nsinus. There is also mild mucosal thickening within bilateral \nanterior ethmoid air cells and frontoethmoidal recesses. Right \nfrontal sinus is hypoplastic. There is minimal mucosal \nthickening in the right sphenoid sinus anteriorly. Mastoid air \ncells are well aerated bilaterally. \n  \nImpression: \n1. No evidence for acute intracranial abnormalities.  MRI would \nbe more \nsensitive for an acute infarction, if clinically warranted. \n2. Chronic right maxillary sinusitis with atelectasis of the \nright maxillary sinus. \n\n***************\nMRI Head ___\n***************\nFINDINGS:  \n  \nAs mentioned on the preliminary read, there is a tiny focus of \nslow diffusion in the head of the right caudate series 500 and \n502, image 19, representing a small acute infarct. Another tiny \nfocus noted in the left frontal lobe anterior to the central \nsulcus series 502, image 24 is not convincingly identifiable on \nthe ADC sequence on the FLAIR sequence and is too small to be \naccurately characterized. This can represent another tiny \ninfarct versus artifact. No significant surrounding edema or \nmass effect noted around these. No abnormal enhancement. \n\nThe ventricles, the extra-axial CSF spaces, cerebral sulci and \ncerebellar \nfolia are mildly prominent related to some degree of diffuse \nparenchymal \nvolume loss. \n\nThere are extensive FLAIR hyperintense foci in the \nperiventricular and \nsubcortical white matter on the frontal and the parietal lobes \nand a few in the left temporal lobe series 7, image 10, \nnonspecific in appearance and mildly progressed since the prior \nstudy. The small foci in the left temporal lobe are new on the \nprior study of ___. No abnormal enhancement is noted in these \nfoci however. There is no obvious abnormal pachymeningeal or \nleptomeningeal enhancement. \n  \nA tiny T1 hyperintense focus on the spin echo postcontrast \nimages series 10, image 7, may relate to the adjacent bone, as \nnot identifiable on the MPRAGE sequence. The major intracranial \narterial flow voids are noted. There is fetal PCA pattern on the \nleft side. The venous sinuses are unremarkable. Sella, pineal \ngland and the craniocervical junction regions are unremarkable. \n  \nMild ethmoidal mucosal thickening. Sphenoid sinus septations \ninsert on the carotid grooves. The imaged orbits are \nunremarkable. The mastoid air cells are grossly clear. Slightly \nhypointense marrow signal of the calvarium, as before, can \nrelate to cellular marrow, myeloproliferative or \nlymphoproliferative disorders. \n  \n  \nIMPRESSION:  \n  \nTiny acute infarct in the head of the right caudate and a \nquestionable focus in the left frontal lobe anterior to the \ncentral sulcus.  No surrounding edema or mass effect or abnormal \nenhancement. Extensive nonspecific cerebral white matter \nchanges, some of which are progressed since the prior study of \n___. Small foci in the left temporal lobe, new since the prior \nstudy. No abnormal enhancement in the brain parenchyma or \nmeninges. Close Followup as needed. \n\n***************\nTTE ___\n***************\n\nFindings  \nThis study was compared to the prior study of ___.  \nLEFT ATRIUM: Elongated LA. \n\nRIGHT ATRIUM\/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal interatrial septum.

There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic \nhypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. \n\nCompared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, no \nclear change.   \n\n***************\nRUQ ___\n***************\nFINDINGS:  \n  \nLIVER: The hepatic parenchyma appears within normal limits. The \ncontour of the liver is smooth. There is no focal liver mass. \nMain portal vein is patent with hepatopetal flow. There is no \nascites. \n  \nBILE DUCTS: There is no intrahepatic biliary dilation.

There was penetration with thin \nand nectar thick consistencies of barium. Patient also \ndemonstrated evidence of gross aspiration with nectar thick \nliquids. \n  \nIMPRESSION:  \n  \n1. Penetration with thin and nectar-thick barium. \n2. Gross aspiration with nectar thick barium. \n\n=================\nEEG Recording\n=================\n___: This is an abnormal continuous ICU EEG monitoring \nstudy because of diffuse background, occasional right temporal \nand near continuous bi-posterior slowing. These findings are \nindicative of a moderate encephalopathy of nonspecific etiology, \nwith the more focal right temporal slowing concerning for focal \nsubcortical dysfunction in this region also of nonspecific \netiology and the bi-posterior slowing concerning for a possible \nstructural lesion. The multifocal and generalized discharges \nwith triphasic morphology (GPD+R) are indicative of global \ncortical irritability with a possible underlying toxic-metabolic \ncomponent. By formal criteria, no electrographic seizures are \nrecorded. \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n=================\nSUMMARY STATMENT\n=================\n___ with extensive cardiac history including atrial fibrillation \nand congestive heart failure (ejection fraction of 35-40%) \npresented with altered mental status (unresponsive), likely \nsecondary to pneumonia and ischemic right caudate stroke, with \noverlying toxic metabolic encephalopathy as measured on EEG. She \ncompleted a course of antibiotics for her pneumonia, was already \non maximal medical therapy for stroke prevention and treatment, \nand began antiepileptic treatment with Keppra. Because of her \naltered mental status and stroke, she failed speech and swallow \nand ultimately required placement of a nasogastric tube for \nnutrition. On admission she also had elevated troponins, which \nwere attributed to demand ischemia, and LFTs, both of which had \nresolved. She has improved slightly since admission--she is \nalert and interactive--though far from baseline; her recovery \nfrom the stroke is likely limited given presence of vascular \ndementia and multiple cardiac comorbidities.\n\n=================\nACTIVE ISSUES\n=================\n\n# Altered mental status:\nAt baseline she has dementia but is normally talkative and \nresponsive. She was found unresponsive ___ @ ~5:30AM after \ngoing to sleep the night before, so it was unclear when the \ninsult occurred. Initial evaluation did not show any evidence of \nbleeding (NCHCT), significant electrolyte abnormalities (only \nhad slight hyponatremia to 133, hypocalcemia to 8.3 with ionized \ncalcium 1.07, and hypomagnesemia to 0.9 which improved with \nrepletion), or digoxin toxicity (level 0.9; no bradycardia or AV \nblock on EKG and Cr at baseline). There was concern for \ninfection give patient's history of becoming slightly confused \nwith UTIs, but initially she was afebrile and without \nleukocytosis. Her UA was clear and CXR showed evidence of \npotential LLL PNA. She was started on broad spectrum \nantibiotics, which were discontinued after a negative LP on \n___. However, that evening, she spiked a fever and developed \nhypoxia (see active issue \"Pneumonia\" below) and was restarted \non antibiotics, which were later narrowed. Her full antiobiotic \ncourse is listed below. An MRI also revealed evidence of a \nstroke (see active issue \"Stroke\" below). Because patient \ncontinued to exhibit abulia and remained minimally verbal \n(though improved from admission), an EEG was obtained, which \nshowed abnormal discharges (see active issue \"Abnormal EEG\" \nbelow).   Antibiotic history:\n-Vanc 1000mg IV bid ___ \n-Zosyn 4.5g IV q8hr ___\n-Ampicillin 2g IV q6hr ___\n-Cefepime 2g IV bid ___\n-Levofloxacin 750mg IV daily ___\n\n# Ischemic Stroke:  \nShe exhibited persistent left-sided weakness, depressed mental \nstatus, aspiration, and non-specific EEG changes. MRI on ___ \nshowed a small acute infarct in the right caudate and a \nquestionable focus in the left frontal lobe. Family was informed \nthat she has a guarded prognosis given that she developed a \nstroke on optimal medical management of stroke risk factors and \nlimited recovery since presentation. Because she is already \nanticoagulated on warfarin, she does not require additional \ntreatment with aspirin.\n\n# Abnormal EEG:\nVideo EEG monitoring started on ___. She was noted to have \nbeta and delta wave slowing with non-specific discharges and \nsome focality in temporal region, consistent with possible \nmetabolic toxic abnormality. At the recommendation of neurology, \nshe was started on Keppra (500mg -> 750mg bid) and showed \nimprovement on EEG. \n\n# Community Aquired Pneumonia:\nFive day course of antibiotics completed.  Patient had RLL \ninfiltrate on admission chest x-ray, fever, and hypoxemia.  \n\n# Aspiration\nConcern for aspiration from CXR obtained for fever\/hypoxia on \n___. Patient coughed with all consistencies on ___ and \ndesatted to the ___ at one point. On ___ S\/S eval did not \ncough but still desatted. On ___ Video swallow demonstrated \npenetration with thin and thick liquids and gross aspiration \nwith nectar thick. on ___ patient had delayed cough with ice \nchips and pureed foods; still at significant risk for \naspiration.\n\n# Nutrition\nPatient has been kept NPO ___ ___. Giving maintenance fluids \nD51\/2NS with close attention to fluid status given history of \nCHF. After initial unsuccessful attempts at NGT placement, she \nreceived one on ___ and was started on tube feeds of Glucerna \n1.2 @ 55ml\/hr, which she tolerated well\n\n# Goals of Care\nFamily meetings were held throughout her hospitalization. \nUltimately, the decision was to make Ms. ___ DNR\/DNI given \nthat CPR is not indicated for her.  On the day before discharge, \na family meeting was held with ___ (HCP, daughter), ___ \n(son), ___ (husband), Dr. ___ from palliative care, \nand her primary team.  We offfered a framework for discussing \nthree realms of priorities: (a) comfort & dignity, (b) length of \ndays, (c) physical location of care.  Also discussed the options \nfor feeding and the risks \/ benefits of each:  (a) nasogastric \ntube, (b) PEG tube, (c) supervised feeding by mouth.  Patient is \nbeing transferred to an acute rehabilitation facility to \noptimize her chances of recovery from her acute stroke, and to \ncontinue a trial of tube feeds.  However, ___ \n___, is far from home and difficult for her husband, ___ to \naccess as he does not drive long distances.  Family plans to \nconvene with patient's brothers on ___ and ask her what she \nwants, and honor her wishes.  They hope to ultimately bring the \npatient closer to home.  ___ signed DNR\/DNI form which is \nplaced in paper chart and copy was given to her.  \n\n# Transaminitis:\nElevated AST\/ALT and alk pho with normal bili, suggesting \nhepatocellular pattern. Wide differential with negative work-up \nincluded: hepatitis (viral abs negative), medication effect \n(statin held initially), a\/calculous cholecystitis (would expect \nleukocytosis and higher LFTs; further RUQ U\/S on ___ \nnegative), or parasitic infection (smear negative). LFTs \ndowntrended to within normal limits and her statin was \nrestarted.  However, upon restarting atorvastatin 80mg, her LFTs \nwere beginning to trend up again.  She previously tolerated \natorvastatin at a dose of 20mg, so upon discharge, atorvastatin \nwas reduced to 40mg.  LFTs should be repeated after several days \nof the decreased dose.\n\n# Periorbital edema \/ erythema:  \nLikely due to fluid overload \/ hypoalbuminemia.  Negative \nscreening tests for inflammatory disease \/ multiple myeloma.\n\n=================\nINACTIVE ISSUES\n=================\n\n# Congestive Heart Failure:\nDiastolic dysfunction with recent LVEF 40% on ___ TTE. CXR on \n___ revealed patchy diffuse opacities so diuretics were \nrestarted. BNP at that time was ___. She was discharged on her \nhome medications.  \n\n# Troponinemia:  \nTroponins elevated at the ED and peaked ___ at 0.30 without \nelevated CK-MB (5, 6) or acute EKG changes, suggesting demand \nischemia without infarction. Underlying causes for increased \ndemand likely infection or CHF exacerbation (see above). Of \nnote, patient had similar elevation of troponins in the recent \npast. TTE performed on ___ notable for left ventricular \nsystolic function that is mildly to moderately depressed (LVEF= \n40 %) with inferior\/infero-lateral hypokinesis and septal \ndysynchrony \/ hypokinesis.\n\n# Atrial Fibrillation:\nChronic condition; CHADS2 score of 4 (CHF, HTN, Age, DM). She \nwas monitored on telemetry and appropriately anticoagulated \n(reversed temporarily for LP procedure on ___. We discussed \nwith her family on ___ that her stroke is likely secondary to \nAF and that patient is already receiving maximal treatment for \nthis.\n\n# Coronary artery disease:\nHistory of MI in ___. Cardiac medications as above.\n\n# Diabetes Mellitus Type 2:\nOn metformin at home, treated with insulin sliding scale while \ninpatient. Proteinuria was seen on admission UA.\n\n# Chronic Issues\n-Anemia ___ B12 and iron deficiency): continue B12 1000mcg \ndaily\n-GERD: held omeprazole 20mg daily given potential to cause \nhypomagnesemia\n\n====================\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES\n====================\n-code status:  DNR\/DNI, CPR not indicated, discussed with health \ncare proxy (___) in presence of secondary health care proxy \n(___) and husband (___)\n-please check LFTs on ___, atorvastatin dosage reduced ___ \nfor mild LFT elevation, if LFTs do not improve or worsen, \nconsider discontinuing or changing to pravastatin\n-ongoing anticoagulation management for afib on warfarin, next \nINR check on ___\n-recommend repeat speech & swallow evaluation on or after ___, \nto help guide discussions about nutrition\n-follow-up with neurology 1 mo after discharge to rehab \n-with future infections, avoid antibiotics that significantly \nlower seizure threshold\n\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

We performed an extensive work-up that showed evidence of a recent stroke, a likely pneumonia, and small areas of abnormal discharges on EEG brain monitoring which may put ___ at risk for seizures. ___ did not require any additional medications for your stroke because ___ already taking the appropriate ones. ___ completed a course of antibiotics for your pneumonia. Finally, ___ started an antiseizure medication called Keppra. After your stroke, when eating or drinking, food would sometimes go down the wrong pipe and into your lungs. Because of this, ___ received feedings through a tube that goes directly to your stomach. In the ED, they also found that your troponin levels were elevated. Troponin is an enzyme that indicates how much stress the heart is experiencing. Because another heart-specific laboratory test (CK-MB) was normal and because your EKG did not show any new changes, we did not think that ___ were having a heart attack. Instead, we think your heart was just stressed from the underlying infection and stroke. Additionally, in the ED, they found that your liver enzymes were elevated. We did an ultrasound of your abdomen that showed a normal liver and gallbladder. Your gallbladder did have gallstones, which are common in older individuals, but they were not blocking anything.

A dual-lead left-sided pacer remains in place.  The heart \nremains\nenlarged.  There are bilateral effusions, left greater than \nright, with\nassociated bibasilar airspace disease, left greater than right, \nwhich may\nreflect compressive atelectasis, although pneumonia or \naspiration should also be considered.

Prominent right lower extremity superficial soft tissue \nedema.\n3.  Right sided ___ cyst (medial popliteal fossa cyst).\n \n___ left UE US:\nIMPRESSION:  No evidence of DVT in the left arm.  No superficial \nvein\nthrombosis.\n\n___ CXR:\nIn comparison with study of ___, the hazy opacification \ninvolving \nthe right hemithorax is unchanged, consistent with moderate \nright pleural \neffusion.  However, the layering effusion on the left has \nsubstantially \ncleared, though some of this could reflect change in patient \nposition.  The pulmonary vascularity has substantially improved. \n Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette persists.  Dual-channel \npacer device remains in place. \n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ yo female with CKD, HTN, diastolic CHF, AF on coumadin, s\/p \nnephrectomy, chronic right pleural effusion with pleurex \ncatheter in place, and chronic bilateral massive edema presents \nwith leg erythema consistent with cellulitis.  Course \ncomplicated by new diagnosis of lung cancer, acute on chronic \nrenal failure, acute on chronic CHF exacerbation, anemia and \nthrombocytopenia\n  \nACTIVE ISSUES:\n# CELLULITIS:\nUnilateral erythema and warmth in right leg consistent with \ninfection.  She was initially started on broad coverage with IV \nvancomycin on ___ and was narrowed on ___ to doxycycline with \nvery good effect. She finished a 7 day course of doxycycline on \n___ \n\n# ADENOCARCINOMA OF THE LUNG: \nPleural fluid cytology was consistent with adenocarcinoma of the \nlung. Thus, the effusion was likely partially malignant in \nnature. She will likely not pursue further therapy but will \nfollow-up with oncology as an outpatient to discuss options. \n \n# PLEURAL EFFUSIONS: Multifactorial. Pleural fluid studies were \nmostly consistent with transudate but LDH elevated suggesting \nexudate. Initially attributed to acute on chronic diastolic \nheart failure but patient failed to improve with diuresis. \nDiagnosis of lung cancer was then made from the cytology thus \nsuggesting the effusion could be partially malignant in nature. \nShe was initially diuresed aggressively with IV lasix and \neffectively lost volume, but effusions did not improve much, \nlikely as they were partially malignant in origin. She already \nhad a pleural catheter in place on the right so this was drained \nmultiple times during her hospitalization for 300-500cc each \ntime. Given her persistent left effusion despite diuresis this \nwas drained by thoracentesis with a total of 1.2L removed.  She \nexperienced good relief initially, but unfortunately the \neffusion reaccumulated quickly, so IP placed a pleurex catheter \non ___ for periodic drainage at rehab and at home. Her lasix was \ninitially increased but then decreased back to her home dose at \ndischarge. New dry weight is ~62.1kg.\n\n# ANEMIA AND THROMBOCYTOPENIA:\nNoted incidentally to have a decrease in platelets from \npreviously normal values to 60-70K on admission, which appears \nto have developed in ___. She also had a slow decrease in \nher hemoglobin\/hematocrit over that time period and some \npositive markers of hemolysis, including a positive coomb's \ntest.  Given these two findings, it was thought that she may \nhave ___ (warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia and \nthrombocytopenia).  Hematology was consulted and reviewed her \nsmear, which was not consistent with hemolytic anemia, so they \nthought anemia may be due to chronic slow blood loss (esp given \ncoumadin use).  Thrombocytopenia thought to be ITP vs \ndrug-induced, so ranitidine was stopped since that is a \nmedication that can have this effect.  Platelets improved to \n>100K on discharge. She will follow up with hematology on ___ \nand should have her CBC monitored at her next PCP ___.\n \n# ACUTE ON CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE:\nCr up to 1.8 from baseline ~1.4 on admission.  Likely due to \ncardiorenal syndrome and venous congestion, as creatinine \nactually improved back to baseline with diuresis.\n  \nINACTIVE ISSUES BY PROBLEM:\n# ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: Coumadin held intermittently during \nhospitalization for planned procedures such as the thoracentesis \nand pleurex placement, but it was restarted on discharge.  She \nshould have her next INR on ___ at rehab. \n \n# CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE:\nPlavix held prior to pleurex placement.

The Ramus \nstent was totally occluded once again.\n\nInterventional Details\nA 6 ___ XBLAD3.5 guiding catheter was used to engage the LMCA \nand provided sub-optimal support. A 180 cm ___ Pro12 \nguidewire was then successfully delivered across the lesion. \nThis required a 6 ___ Guideliner and a Turnpike LP for \nsupport to cross as Pilot ___ and Samurai wires would not cross. \nThe CP 12 appeared and felt free after the mid vessel but was \nfree thereafter.\nCollateral flow could not confirm intraluminal position. With \ndifficulty, advanced the Turnpike into the distal vessel. \nInjection showed a portion of the vessel to be dissected but the \nwire was in distal position.\nPerformed PTCA with a 2.0 mm balloon in the ISR as well as the \ndissection, tacking it up. Prolonged inflations maintained flow. \nFinal angiography revealed normal flow, stable Type A dissection \nin the mid vessel and 40% residual stenosis. In light of CKD and \nstable angioplasty result and the lack of desire to add more \nstents to this vessel that has developed recurrent CTO, we \nelected to leave a POBA result.\nImpressions:\n1.

His Isosorbide was ultimately \nincreased from 60 mg Daily to 90 mg daily.  He was maintained on \na heparin drip while he awaiting cardiac catheterization.  For \nmore details concerning the catheterization please refer to that \nreport, detailed previously.  He underwent POBA to 100% occluded \nRAMUS stent with TIMI flow 2.  He reported relief of his \nsymptoms and continued to ambulate the unit with no further \nchest pain.  His troponins remained flat throughout his stay.  \nHis Torsemide and Spirinolactone were held post catheterization \ndue to an increase in his creatinine to 1.9.  He trended down to \n1.8 on the day of discharge.  He was advised to continue to hold \nthese meds for an additional day and to resume them on ___, \n___.  \nHis INR was therapeutic on the day of discharge at 3.1, up from \n2.1 on ___.  He will continue with all of his medications \nas prescribed with this one change in Isosorbide.

A \nphysical exam was performed. The patient was administered \nmoderate sedation. A physical exam was performed prior to \nadministering anesthesia. Supplemental oxygen was used. The \npatient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position and an \nendoscope was introduced through the mouth and advanced under \ndirect visualization until the jejunum (110 cm) was reached. \nCareful visualization of the upper GI tract was performed. The \nprocedure was not difficult. The patient tolerated the procedure \nwell. There were no complications.\nImpression: An actively bleeding dieulafoy was located at 110 cm \nin the jejunum.

She was given a capsule endoscopy on the first day of her \nadmission, which eventually showed active bleeding int he small \nintestines on the same day that her Hct dropped from 29 to 23.  \nShe underwent a push enteroscopy by gastroenterology, which \nshowed an active dieulafoy bleed in her jejunum that was then \ncauterized.  Her Hct remained stable in low ___ throughout the \nremainder of her hospitalization, which was extended by several \ndays given the need to bridge her on heparin gtt to therapeutic \nINR levels of 2.5-3.5 given her mechanical valves.  She was \ncontinued on pantoprazole PO bid for GI prophylaxis.\n\n# Fever: Found to have a fever 101.6 and worsening \nwheezing\/cough the day after her push enteroscopy.  Initially \nconcerned for HCAP, though CXR negative ___ and ___ and no \nleukocytosis. Fever may have been related to transient \nbacteremia from procedure, or from transfusions.  Blood, urine, \nand sputum cultures were all negative.  The patient's \nwheezing\/cough improved to baseline within 2 days, and she never \nneeded antibiotic therapy (but did use nebulizer treatments).  \nThis was likely due to a short course of viral bronchitis.  \n\n#) Mechanical valves - She was considered to be at risk for \nhemolysis or for SBE in appropriate clinical setting, but did \nnot appear to have either during her hospitalization.  She was \nbridged with heparin gtt to goal INR 2.5-3.5, and on the day her \nINR was 2.7, she was discharged on her home dose of coumadin 3mg \n6x\/week and 1.5mg 1x\/week.\n\n#) Afib - remained rate-controlled throughout her \nhospitalization.

Unclear source as pt with no localizing \nsymptoms other than headache. No stiff neck\/meningismus to \nsuggest meningitis. Most likely cause was thought to be viral \nsource, possibly URI, given complaints of general \nfatigue\/malaise and headache, although resp panel negative. \nReceived 1g Vancomycin in ED as well as 1g Tylenol. This was \ndiscontinued on admission as she did not have a central line and \nhad no signs of skin breakdown.

Patient did complain of \nflare symptoms (crampy abdominal pain and clots in stool) on \n___ AM, and then had pink stools on ___ and worsening \nabdominal pain. Patient's infectious work up remained stable \nafter 5 days in hospital, and patient noted her usual UC flares \nusually are accompanied by fevers. Therefore, patient was deemed \nsafe for discharge given she appeared clinically well and had \nstrong desire to be home. The fevers she continued to spike even \nwhile on Cefepime were thought to be from her UC flare.

We gave you with antibiotics to treat you for any possible infection. All of your studies returned normal, without evidence of infection, which does happen at times. You likely had a viral illness which went away on its own. However toward the end of your hospitalization you continued to spike fevers to 101.5. Given that your vitals remained stable, and that you did not have any new symptoms EXCEPT for symptoms which you describe as your typical Ulcerative colitis flare symptoms, it is likely that these fevers are due to a UC flare.

He has had an increase \nin his flares recently and this has caused him to go to multiple \nhospitals for this.  As evidence by the records obtained from \nhis outside GI physician, ___ has had several \nstents placed with varying degrees of success.  He has also had \nimaging done outside that has not shown findings consistent with \nchronic pancreatitis.  As a result, the differential diagnosis \nof his abdominal pain was broadened to include cecal volvulus, \nconstipation related, acute intermittent porphyria, autoimmune \nvasculitis or SLE\/RA related, hernia related, PUD or IBS\/IBD.  \nGI was consulted in house and advised checking a TTG for celiac \ndisease (negative) ESR\/CRP (CRP was elevated) and IGG4 for \nautoimmune pancreatitis (negative).  Due to persistent abdominal \npain, the patient got a plane film abdominal XR which showed \nfindings suggestive of cecal volvulus.  A CT of the abdomen and \npelvis was obtained which was negative for an acute process.  \nThese films were reviewed with the radiologist to evaluate a \nnarrowed and dilated segment near the patients prior colostomy \nbut they felt this was just several slices missed in the CT \nscanner.  The patient also had a RUQ US which was wnl.  \nHepatitis serologies, RF, ___ and ANCA were also done and were \nnegative.  H. pylori serology was negative.  The patient \nendorsed persistent pain and was treated with a morphine pca for \nseveral days and made npo and given IV fluids.  The patients \npain marginally improved.  His diet was slowly advance, which he \ntolerated well.  He was discharged home on a bland diet and a \nPPI BID.  He should follow closely with a pancreas specialist \nfor further evaluation.\n.\n# History of alcoholism with persistent pain without an obvious \norganic cause:\nThe patient reports not using alcohol since ___.  The patients \nfamily voiced some concerns about narcotic\/opioid dependence.  \nIn addition, after extensive evaluation and conservative \nmanagement, the patient was still requiring high dose of IV \nmorphine (in the 200-300 mg IV range in 24 hours) from his PCA \nwithout any obvious cause.  The pain service was consulted and \nthey advised using gabapentin, Tylenol and discontinuing the pca \nand using both long and short acting morphine.  The day \nfollowing removal of the PCA, the patient had a minimal narcotic \nrequirement.  Thus, he was sent home with just short acting \nmorphine for breakthrough pain in addition to a lower dose of \ngabapentin to prevent sedation.  He was also sent home with \nNSAID's, tramadol and a bowel regimen.\n.\n# Urinary retention\nThe patient has had issues with this in the past without any \nobvious cause.  His retention was exacerbated with his high \nnarcotic use.  A Foley needed to be placed.  The patient was \nweaned off his narcotics and his Foley was then taken out.  He \nwas able to urinate on his own\n.\n# Schistocytes on automated smear and persistent abdominal pain \nwith weight loss\nThe hematology\/oncology service was consulted for further \nevaluation of an occult malignancy vs. a hematologic process \nthat was causing the patients symptoms.  The patients smear was \nreviewed by the hematology team and it was negative for \nschistocytes.  They recommended checking urine PBG (was \nnegative) and a testicular US for occult malignancy (negative).  \nCan consider checking 24 hr urine test for ALA, PBG, and total \nporphyrins as an outpatient.  LDH was also normal and the \npatients smears did not show any signs of MDS or \nmyeloproliferative disorder.     \n.\n# Dysthymia\nThe patient endorsed depressed mood without SI or HI.  \nPsychiatry was consulted per pain recommendations and they \nrecommended d\/c of the patients hydroxyzine and starting Remeron \nat night.

Nasal bone fractures are probably chronic, be correlated \nclinically. \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ with unclear past medical history (possible previous \nsubstance abuse\/psych admissions for agitation), who was \nadmitted on ___ after being found unresponsive after \nunknown substance ingestion. Soon after arrival to the hospital \nhe became acutely agitated and violent, requiring physical and \nchemical restraints. The ingested substance(s) were never \ndefinitely established, but the toxidrome and history pointed \ntoward a synthetic cannabinoid ingestion (patient's girlfriend \nat one point admitted that patient had recent \"K-2\" use). Tox \nscreen was positive for benzodiazepines and oxycodone. PCP \nscreen was sent and was pending at discharge. Collateral from \npatient's\ngirlfriend revealed that he told her that he had used K2 and\nheroin, which he admitted to psychiatry moonlighter on ___. \nHe later told that psychiatry ___ on ___ that he had \nused Xanax and gabapentin. \n\nHis agitation in the ED manifested as violent thrashing and \nuncooperative behavior requiring multiple security personnel to \nrestrain him for the safe administration of medications. He \nrequired large doses of benzodiazepines, neuroleptics, and \nketamine and was eventually intubated for airway protection.\n\nWhile intubated, he required large doses of propofol, fentanyl, \nand precedex with intermittent breakthrough midazolam to \nmaintain safe and adequate sedation.\n\nOn ___, he was extubated however developed severe agitation \nwith required 4-point leather restraints and escalating doses \nHaldol, thorazine, and lorazepam. Ultimately, the patient's \nagitation became so violent that he required re-initiation of \npropofol and fentanyl with re-intubation. Psychiatry was \nemergently consulted and recommended control of agitation with \nliberal use of benzodiazepines given high suspicion for \nsynthetic cannabinoid ingestion.\n\nBy ___, patient was able to be extubated again. Agitation was \ncontrolled with benzodiazepines and intermittent physical \nrestraints. Agitation slowly waned and patient became more \ncooperative. His family and loved ones agreed that he was \nreturning to his baseline mental status.\n\nHospital course was complicated by rhabdomyolysis with CK \npeaking >6000, likely secondary to violent thrashing against \nrestraints. he was treated with IV fluids with sustained \ndowntrending CK. Patient also has some skin\/soft tissue injuries \nfrom fighting against restraints. These were dressed and cared \nfor by nursing without signs of infection or local \ncomplications.\n\n=====================\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\n=====================\n[ ] Patient needs to establish primary care with a local PCP. \nFollow up with a psychiatric or mental health specialist is also \nstrongly encouraged.\n[ ] Patient is strongly encouraged to abstain from any further \nsubstance use, especially with illicit drugs such as synthetic \ncannabinoids, non-prescribed benzodiazepines, and non-prescribed \nopioids. \n\n#COMMUNICATION: Girlfriend ___ ___\n#CODE: Full (presumed)\n\n \nMedications on Admission:\nNone\n \nDischarge Medications:\nNone\n \nDischarge Disposition:\nHome\n \nDischarge Diagnosis:\nPrimary Diagnosis: Toxic Ingestion, unspecified, suspected \nsynthetic cannabinoid toxicity.\n\n \nDischarge Condition:\nMental Status: Clear and coherent.\nLevel of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.\nActivity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.","summary":"You were admitted to ___. You were found unresponsive and then became extremely agitated and demonstrated dangerous behavior. In addition, you had injury to your muscles (rhabdomyolysis) causing a high level of CK in the blood, which can cause kidney damage. All of these problems were probably the result of drug use, likely from synthetic cannabinoids (for example, K-2). To control your agitation and to keep you safe, you required large doses of powerful medications to calm you. At times your behavior was so dangerous that you had to be heavily sedated and put on a breathing machine. To protect your kidneys from the muscle breakdown, you received intravenous fluids. Finally, you were evaluated and followed by the psychiatry department as well as the hospital social worker. You need to stay hydrated by drinking lots of water and lead a healthy lifestyle. You should avoid all drugs including K-2 and other synthetic cannabinoids, heroin\/oxycodone\/opiates, Xanax\/other benzodiazepines, marijuana, and alcohol. You are encouraged to get treatment for dangerous substance use through a drug counseling program."}

She was admitted to the hospital \nfor intravenous antibiotics (vancomycin) for purulent \ncellulitis. She was transitioned to oral clindamycin and \ncompleted a 7 day course on ___. She was also found to have \nright ventricular hypokinesis and a primarily restrictive \npattern on pulmonary function testing. She will follow up with \npulmonary and cardiology to continue her work up and treatment.\n\n# Right lower extremity cellulitis: Pt presented with RLE pain, \nerythema, edema, and skin break down.  The pt endorsed a \ntraumatic incident to the RLE without active bleeding but with \ndisruption of the skin barrier.  This represented the likely \nportal of entry for bacteria.  The pt was initially treated with \nKeflex as an outpatient, but her cellulitis persisted.  While \nnot much purulence was present on admission to the hospital, the \npt showed a picture on her phone with copious pus emanating from \nher RLE.  She was admitted to the hospital for IV vancomycin for \npurulent RLE cellulitis that failed outpatient management.  Day \n1 of vancomycin was ___.  On ___, she was transitioned \nto oral clindamycin.  She completed a 7 day clindamycin course \non ___.\n\n# Oxygen Requirement: Pt has desaturations to ___ with \nambulation while in the hospital.  She had a chest xray with \nevidence of mild CHF.  She had a TTE showing right ventricular \nhypokinesis.  She had a DDimer of 1008 and an inconclusive CTA.  \nGiven low concern for PE and body habitus, she did not have a VQ \nscan.  She also had PFTs showing a restrictive pattern, possible \nobstruction, and mild diffusion defect.  She was evaluated by \ncardiology and pulmonology.  The etiology of her O2 requirement \nwas felt to be multifactorial including heart failure, pulmonary \nhypertension, and OHS.  She will have further workup and \npossibly a stress test and right heart catheterization as an out \npatient.  She will also continue to use her CPAP as she can and \nwill use supplemental oxygen. She was encouraged to follow up \nwith bariatric surgery given concern that a large component of \nher disease is due to obesity.\n\n# Heart Failure: During the hospital course, the pt had chest \nxrays showing evidence of pulmonary congestion and had ___ edema. \n Her weight was over 220 kg and her most recently documented dry \nweight was 213 kg.  She was 220 kg on discharge.  She had IV \nfurosemide in the hospital with good urine output.  Her IV \ndiuresis was stopped when her creatinine increased to 1.4.  She \nwas discharged on 20 mg PO furosemide daily.  Her chlorthalidone \nwas held while she was undergoing diuresis.  She will need outpt \nmonitoring of wt and volume status as well as titration of \nfurosemide.\n\n# Obesity: Pt very concerned about weight and understands that \nweight is contributing to various medical problems.  She would \nlike to lose weight.  Her A1c was 5.8 on ___.  She is \ninterested in working to lose weight.  She has also been \nreferred to the ___ Clinic to work on \nweight management and encouraged to f\/u with bariatric surgery.\n\n# Chronic venous stasis: She has chronic venous stasis changes \non the bilateral lower extremities.

It was also considered very unlikely to be \nnecrotizing fasciitis given steady improvement in erythema.  He \nhad a PICC line placed and will need to continue vancomycin (no \nmore clinda or imipenem per ID) for ___ weeks total (starting \nwhen it first started receding on ___, complete on ___, \nwhen he has follow-up with ID - ___ at 9:30 am on \n___ will need OPAT weekly labs CBC\/LFTs\/BUN\/Cr\/vanco \ntrough). He was discharged on tylenol and percocet #40 for his \npain, and was instructed to not drink alcohol or drive after \ntaking percocet.\n\n# Anemia\/UGIB: Complained of melena soon after admission, and \nhis hematocrit steadily dropped from 37 to 22 in three days.  He \nunderwent an EGD, which showed a large duodenal clot and \nbleeding duodenal dieulafoy lesion.  He was monitored in the \nFICU for two days for abdominal pain, CT abdomen negative, and \nimproved on simethacone and bowel regimen.  He was placed on \npantoprazole gtt then IV bid, and was discharged on PO bid.  His \nHpylori was negative.  He will need repeat endoscopy in ___ \nweeks, and likely colonoscopy at some point as outpatient.  He \nshould not take NSAIDs and should abstain from alcohol as well.\n\n# gout: had a flare on medial L great toe on ___, typically \ngets flare once per year and it has been approximately one year \nsince his last one.  Because he is not able to get NSAIDs given \nhis recent GI bleed, he was started on prednisone 40mg for one \nday, then 20mg for 3 days (to be completed on ___\n\n# COPD: stable in-house, did well with duonebs standing and prn.\n\n# HTN: stable.

After \nbreakfast, she started to feel a sudden onset of weakness, and \ndiaphoresis. She thought that she hadn't eaten well, so she hda \na lung of ham, mashed potatoes and soda, but after this meal \nstarted to develop palpitations. The palpiations were located in \nthe ___ her chest, but did not cause her any pain, and did \nnot cause any lightheadedness. She has had palpitations \nintermittently over the past week. She also had a recent recent \nadmission for pneumonia\/bronchitis two weeks ago. On her ROS she \nendorses nighttime hot flashes, as well as an unspecified amount \nof weight loss ove rthe psat month.

She also endorses increased urinary frequency. \nThe palpitations were the predominate reason she presented to \nthe ED.  \n.  \nIn the ED, initial VS 97.2 133 131\/58 18 100%. On transfer, 98.4 \n- 96-30 147\/65 98 %.

Arterial \ncalcifications, including coronary artery calcifications, and \naortic and dense mitral valve calcifications.  \n.\nEKG ___: Baseline artifact. Regular narrow complex \ntachycardia at 125 per minute with pseudo S waves inferiorly \nmost consistent with A-V nodal re-entrant tachycardia type of \nparoxysmal supraventricular tachycardia. Left axis deviation \nconsistent with left anterior fascicular block. Compared to the \nprevious tracing of ___ paroxysmal supraventricular \ntachycardia is new with previous tracing showing frequent atrial \nectopy. Minuscule R waves or Q waves are again noted inferiorly. \nCannot exclude prior inferior wall myocardial infarction. \nClinical correlation is suggested.  \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nSUBCARINAL MASS: Patient does not have obvious risk factors for \nmalignancy short of her age. She does not drink heaviliy and \ndoes not smoke, and there is no family history of any \nmalignancy. The radiologic differential includes metastasis, \nesophageal cancer, and lymphoma. On further review, she does \nendorse some symptoms concerning for malignancy, such as weight \nloss, loss of appetite, and fatigue. She did have an odd \nauto-diff with 10% \"others\", which were later read as immature \nmonocytes.  IP performed an EBUS and biopsy yesterday that the \npatient tolerated well.  She will follow up in thoracic ___ \nclinic.\n.\nAV NODAL REENTRANT TACHYCARDIA: The patient initially presented \nwith palpitations, which had occurred once before the episode \nshe presented with, and recurred once again during her \nhospitalization.  Her EKGs in the ED and on the floor during \nthese episodes were consistent with AV nodal reentrant \ntachycardia.  She was hemodynamically stable during these \nepisodes, although she was symptomatic with palptiations.  In \nthe ED, she received IV fluids and the episode resolved.  On the \nfloor, she received metoprolol 12.5 mg PO and eventually the \nepisode terminated, although it is not clear if either of these \ninterventions actually caused her to return to a normal rhythm.  \nTSH was checked, which was slightly low, but her free T4 was \nnormal.  Regardless, she was discharged on metoprolol succinate \n25 mg PO daily for prophylaxis.\n.  \nELEVATED D-DIMER: The patient does not have a pulmonary embolism \nor DVT on imaging.\n.  \nHYPOTHYROIDISM: She has a slighltly low TSH with a normal T4, so \nit is unlikely that hyperthyroidism is contributing to her \narrhythmias.

Heart size \nis normal.  \nLungs clear. No pleural abnormality. Healed left middle rib \nfracture. \n\nFINDINGS: Mild atelectasis is noted at the lung bases. There are \nno pleural effusions. Note is made of a left fat-containing \nBochdalek hernia. \n  \nThe heart is normal in size, with trace pericardial effusion. \nRight atrial \npacemaker lead courses in expected position. Calcifications are \nnoted in the mitral annulus and descending thoracic aorta. \n  \nNote is made of a small hiatal hernia. \n  \nABDOMEN: Again seen are multiple hepatic hypodensities measuring \nup to 7 mm in segment VI (4:49), too small to characterize. \nMultiple punctate hepatic calcifications are also present, \nlikely reflecting prior granulomatous disease. Several calcified \nstones are noted within a partially distended gallbladder, \nwithout wall edema or pericholecystic fluid. There is no \nintrahepatic biliary dilatation. The common bile duct is mildly \ndilated up to 8 mm, but tapers smoothly to the head of the \npancreas. The pancreas is unremarkable. The spleen is normal in \nsize, with scattered granulomatous calcifications. \n  \nAgain seen is a 1.7 cm fat-density lesion in the medial limb of \nthe left \nadrenal gland, consistent with adenoma. The right adrenal is \nnormal. The \nkidneys enhance and excrete contrast promptly and symmetrically, \nwithout \nstones, masses, or hydronephrosis. \n  \nPELVIS: The bladder and distal ureters are normal. A 1.6-cm \nexophytic \ncalcified fibroid is noted projecting from the right posterior \nuterine fundus. The ovaries are normal. \n  \nGASTROINTESTINAL: Beginning at the level of the mid jejunum in \nthe left \nupper quadrant (4:100), there is mild diffuse dilation of \nsmall-bowel loops up to 2.7 cm, with internal air-fluid levels. \nTransition point is noted in the left lower quadrant (4:100 and \n500B:15), with relative distal decompression of distal ileal \nloops. However, there is reconstitution of bowel caliber at the \nlevel of the cecum, which is anteriorly folded and mildly \ndilated at 7 cm. A moderate amount of retained fecal material is \nnoted throughout the ascending and transverse colon. Descending \ncolon and rectum are unremarkable. \n  \nA small amount of free fluid is present, concentrated in the \nperihepatic\/perisplenic spaces, and tracking along the left \nparacolic gutter and pelvis. There is no free intraperitoneal \nair to suggest perforation. No pneumatosis or mesenteric\/portal \nvenous gas to indicate ischemia. Scattered prominent \nretroperitoneal and mesenteric lymph nodes are present, \nmeasuring up to 9 mm, and likely reactive. \n  \nCT ANGIOGRAM: Scattered calcifications and soft plaques are \nnoted throughout the descending thoracic and abdominal aorta, \nwith mild stenosis of the renal artery origins. There has been \nsurgical resection and closure of the infrarenal abdominal aorta \nand proximal common iliac arteries. Trace surrounding \nphlegmonous changes are present, without drainable fluid \ncollections. \n  \nThe bones are diffusely demineralized. Mild multilevel \ndegenerative changes are present, with anterior osteophytes and \nfacet arthropathy at multiple levels. There is a chronic \ncompression deformity of L3, with approximately 50% loss of \nheight. Bone graft material is noted at L3-4. There is evidence \nof discitis at L4-5, with extensive irregular endplate \ndestruction, bony fragmentation, and grade 1 anterolisthesis. An \nadjacent fluid collection in the left psoas muscle is stable at \n2.6 x 1.6 cm, with mild peripheral enhancement suggestive of \ninfectious or inflammatory changes. \n  \nChanges of right axillary-bifemoral bypass are present, with \nretrograde \nopacification of the bilateral distal common, external, and \ninternal iliac \narteries. A small fluid collection in the right inguinal region \nis minimally decreased in size at 8 mm, and likely represents a \nseroma or lymphocele.  Scattered inguinal nodes are present, \nmeasuring up to 17 mm on the left and 13 mm on the right, and \nlikely reactive. \n  \nIMPRESSION: \n  \n1. New partial small-bowel obstruction with transition point in \nleft lower \nquadrant, presumably due to post-operative adhesions. Trace \nascites, without evidence of bowel perforation. \n  \n2. L4-5 discitis, with extensive endplate destruction and stable \n2.6 x 1.6 cm left psoas fluid collection. \n  \n3. Changes of infrarenal abdominal aortic and common iliac \nartery resection, \nwith residual post-surgical inflammatory changes. \n  \n4. Patent right axillary-bifemoral graft, with retrograde \nopacification of \nbilateral external and internal iliac arteries. Minimally \ndecreased right \ninguinal fluid collection.  \n  \n5. 1.8 cm left adrenal adenoma. \n  \n6.

Pneumonia: Patient was treated for viral vs. bacterial (more \nlikely given focal findings on CXR and recent hospitalization) \npneumonia.  He initially received Tamiflu until influenza A and \nB negative results were obtained.  Given recent hospitalization, \nhe also received ceftaz\/vancomycin for hospial acquired \npneumonia for 3 days.  After being afebrile for 48hrs with \nnegative cultures, patient was transitioned to high dose \nLevofloxacin (adjusted for renal function) for 5 days.  He was \ndischarged with 2 additional days of 250mg PO QD to be completed \non ___.  Various evaluations were used to define the \npathogen without success.  A sputum specimen was determined to \nbe contaminated by upper respiratory secretions. A urine \nlegionella ag was negative and liver function tests were within \nnormal limits. \n.\n2. Diastolic cardiac dysfunction:  Patient has chronic disease \nthought to be a major contributor to his respiratory distress \ngiven clinical setting of recently discontinued diuretic, \ndepedent pulmonary crackles, and visibly volume overloaded with \n1+ pitting edema to the knee.  He has a history of diastolic \nheart failure with EF of 65-70% on last ECHO. Torsemide was \ndiscontinued during and after last hospitalization out of \nconcern for dehydration.  After admission, patient was diuresed \nwith escalating doses of diuretics. Patient was discharged at a \nweight of 180lbs.  Baseline weight was previously reported as \n178lbs.  He was discharged on his home torsemide dose of 20mg PO \ndaily.  Patient will be followed with ___, weight monitoring, \ndietary instructions, and multiple follow-up appointments.\n.\n3. Acute on chronic renal failure: Patient has with chronic \nkidney insufficiency (baseline crt 2.2 in the inpatient setting, \nbut outpatient baseline of 3.0 according to ___ records \nthought to reflect more accurate baseline).  His creatinine \nincreased likely related to dehydration with insensible losses \npoor oral intake with current illness, this is moderately \nsupported by a BUN:Cr ratio of close to 20:1.  Negative \neosinophiluria, lack of predominant fever, and minimal urine \nwhite and red blood cells argued against acute interstitial \nnephritis. Throughout admission he his blood pressure was \nmonitored, nephrotoxins were avoided, and his medications were \nrenally dosed.  His allopurinol and valsartan medications were \nheld during the admission in the setting of ARF to prevent \nexacerbation.  Prior to discharge his valsartan was restarted at \na lower dose (from 160mg\/d to 40mg\/d) per renal consultation.  \nAt admission his Cr increased to 3.5 on ___ and then \ndecreased to 2.9 and 3.0 prior to Discharge which is felt to be \nthe patient's baseline.  The patient will be called by his \nprimary nephrologist's office to schedule follow up.  \n.\n4. Anemia: Patient demonstrated normocytic anemia.  The \nhematocrit decreased from baseline throughout admission, likely \nrelated to phlebotomy and EPO deficiency secondary to renal \ndisease.  Hematocrit dropped throughout admission with a nadar \nof 23.4.  On ___ anemia labs revealed TIBC of 173, Ferritin \nof 151, TRF of 133.\nWe initiated iron supplementaiton to improve anemia and \ndemonstrate persistent anemia despite Ferritin>200 and \nTransferrin Sat>20% in order to allow patient to qualify fro EPO \ntreatment in the future.  A follow-up appointment was arranged \nwith Dr. ___ at ___.  There  anemia of \nchronic disease, inflammation, and phlebotomy components.  \nPatient continued on iron supplementation, may consider EPO with \nNephrologist on outpatient basis.\n.\n7. Diabetes mellitus, type II:  Patient has poorly controlled \ndiabetes with a HgbA1C of 10.1 on ___ and previous seizure \nepisode thought to be precipitated by hyperglycemia.  While in \nthe hospital he recieved between ___ glargine at night and a \nsliding scale.  Blood sugars ranged from 64-280 and were \nconsistently in the 200s and low 300s by ___, except in the \nmornings after we increased Insulin to 15U Glargine QHS.  When \npatient's evening glargine dose was increased to 15U his morning \nfinger sticks decreased to 60-95. He was returned to his home \ndose of glargine, 9U QHS prior to discharge for fear of \nhypoglycemia given reported past episodes and concerns that \nsugars were more elevated than normal for patient in the setting \nof infection.  His insulin regimen should be addressed in the \noutpatient setting given difficulty titrating dosing in the \nsetting of infection.  We continued aspirin and ___ given their \nbenefit in diabetic patients.  \n.\n7. Seizure: There was concern for a recent seizure episode \nthought to be precipitated by hyperglycemia.  Patient did not \ndemonstrate signs or symptoms consistent with seizure activity \nthroughout his admission.  He did not receive any anti-epileptic \nmedications.  He has follow up with neurology.\n.\n8. Hypertension: Patient was continued on minoxidil and \nmetoprolol per his home dosing regimens.  Valsartan was \ndecreased per renal consult, to be re-evaluated at follow up \nappointment.\n.\n9. Hyperthyroidism (due to chronic kidney disease):  This \npatient was kept on zemplar for secondary hyperparathyroidism.\n.\n10.

It exerts mass effect in \nconjunction with an adjacent splenic cyst upon the stomach, \nsomewhat increased from prior.  \n 2. CBD distention to 8mm w\/o etiology similar to prior  \n 3. main pancreatic duct mildly prominent at 3-4mm in diameter \nwith elongated tubular cysts in the head and uncitate process of \nthe pancreas measuring up to 16mm in diameter, unchanged from \nprior. Possibly IPMN. 4mm cystic lesion in posterior tail of \npancreas.  \n 4. subtle induration of fat LUQ anterior to spleen, stomach and \nLeft upper lobe of liver. Trace fluid is seen adjacent to the \nanterior periohery of LUL of liver not presents on earlier \nstudy, no surrounding inflammatory changes.  \n 5.normal spleen and bowel with diverticulosis no \ndiverticulitis.  \n 6.hiatal hernia  \n \n On the floor, patient is sleeping comfortably.

Mild cardiomegaly without \npulmonary \nedema.  The endotracheal tube projects with its tip 6 cm above \nthe carina.  The course of the nasogastric tube is unremarkable, \nthe tip is not included in the image.  The right PICC line is in \ncorrect position.  There are widespread bilateral severe \nparenchymal opacities and consolidation, right much more than \nleft, some of which have a nodular component, notably in the \nright upper lobe. There appears to be a small right pleural \neffusion.  No left pleural effusion. No pneumothorax.  Mild \ntortuosity of the thoracic aorta. \n.\n___ Echo\nThe left atrium is normal in size. The estimated right atrial \npressure is at least 15 mmHg. There is mild regional left \nventricular systolic dysfunction with focal basal inferior \nhypokinesis. The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = \n50%). The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with \nborderline systoic function. There are three aortic valve \nleaflets. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Physiologic mitral \nregurgitation is seen (within normal limits). There is mild \npulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial \neffusion. \nIMPRESSION: Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, \nc\/w CAD. Dilated right ventricle with borderline systolic \nfunction. At least mild pulmonary hypertension.\n.\n___ Echo\nNo atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The \nestimated right atrial pressure is at least 15 mmHg. There is \nmild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left \nventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal technical \nquality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully \nexcluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is probably \nnormal (LVEF>50%). There is no ventricular septal defect. The \nright ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with depressed free \nwall contractility. There is abnormal systolic septal \nmotion\/position consistent with right ventricular pressure \noverload. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but \naortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. \nThe mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The tricuspid \nvalve leaflets are mildly thickened. Tricuspid regurgitation is \npresent but cannot be quantified. There is moderate pulmonary \nartery systolic hypertension (RA pressure estimate > 15 mmHg \nadded to TR gradient). There is a trivial\/physiologic \npericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of \ntamponade. \nCompared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, \nthe RV appears less dilated. RV systolic function appears \nsimilar (depressed). Focal inferior LV hypokinesis is no longer \nappreciated.  \n.\n___ CT chest:\n1. Diffuse area of ground glass with peribronchial consolidation \nand large \nPreliminary Reportsubpleural consolidation at the lung bases is \ncompatible with viral infection. \n2. Large mediastinal nodes are mainly in the right upper and \nsubcarinal \nstatins. Hilar lymphadenopathy is difficult to assess due to \nlack of contrast. \n3. There is no pleural effusion.  \n4. Bilateral pleural plaques and pleural thickening might be due \nto asbestos exposure. \n.\nRUE U\/S: ___.  Nonocclusive thrombus seen within the right internal \njugular, axillary, basilic, and brachial veins.   \n2.  Right internal jugular central venous line. \n.\nCXR ___: In comparison with the study of ___, there is a \ncontinued and \npossibly progressive opacification involving much of the right \nlung, \nconsistent with clinical diagnosis of asymmetric pulmonary \nedema, pleural \neffusion and compressive atelectasis at the base.

It was elevated in the ED on hospital day 1 \nto 3.8 then has trended down to 3.2 at the day of discharge.  \nThe most likely cause of the patient's acute on chronic renal \nfailure was due to AIN from cephalexin and\/or Bactrim which he \nwas being treated for right leg cellulitis.  He had eosinophils \nin his urine and blood, with mild proteinuria \n(protein:creatinine ratio of 0.2). The patient's FeUrea was 46% \nwhich makes unlikely to be due to prerenal causes.  The timeline \nfits with AIN, as the patient began taking the antibiotics about \n10 days ago. He stated to have poor po intake in the last few \ndays making pre-renal causes possible contributory to worsening \nkidney fx. He also had complains of difficulty urinating and has \nhx of BPH, renal US r\/o hydronephritis and other post renal \nreasons. He was given gentle hydration due to the CHF hx, \nantibiotics were stopped and he was given one dose of \nvanocomycin to tx cellulitis. IV lasix were initially held and \nrestarted prior to d\/c given that creatine was close to \nbaseline. He will have f\/u labs as outpatient 1 day after \ndischarge.\n  \n.\n# HYPERKALEMIA: Patient's K+ was elevated to 5.3 on admission \nlikely due to worsening renal function. His k trended down to \n4.5 after treatment with Kayexalate.  K was 4.8 at time of \ndischarge.  The patient was placed on telemetry for monitoring, \nand he was in Afib with very occasional PVCs. \n.\n# BPH: Patient complains of increased difficulty urinating \nrecently.  He had renal US with no hydronephrosis. He is able to \nurinate with no difficulty while hospitalized. He was continued \non his home dose of tamsulosin. \n.\n# LLE CELLULITIS: Pt has hx of chronic venous stasis and was \nrecently hospitalized ___ for LLE cellulitis.  Patient \nreceived 10 of 14 days of antibiotics,  Bactrim and Keflex. Both \nantibiotics were discontinued due to worsen renal fx as noted \nabove. His left ___ wound as per patient appears much improved. \nHe has small healing ulcers on his L shin area. Otherwise \ncellulitis appears to be resolved. He was given one dose of \nvancomycin and cipro at admission which may stay on his system \nfor a few days. No other antibiotics at this time. He will \ncontinue to have ___ to do drsg changes.\n.\n# SYSTOLIC CHF: Stable during hospitalization.  No evidence of \npulmonary edema on exam.  He has ___ edema at baseline.  His \nLasix was held as described above and was restarted prior to \ndischarge.  The patient's atenolol was continued during the \n___ hospital stay. \n.\n# HTN: Chronic problem.  Stable since admission.  The patient's \nhome atenolol was continued during his hospital stay.\n.\n# CAD \/ HYERLIPIDEMIA: Chronic problem, currently stable.  The \npatient's statin and his atenolol were continued during his \nhospitalization.  The patient is not on aspirin as he has a \nhistory of GI bleeds.\n.\n# ANEMIA: Chronic problem, stable since admission.  Patient's \nbaseline HCT is ~33.  On hospital day 2 it was 30.3, and on \nhospital day 3 it was 29.0, most likely resulting from \nhemodilution.  There was no evidence of active bleeding. \n.\n# THROMBOCYTOPENIA: Chronic problem, stable since admission.  \nPatient's baseline platelet count is ~105.  On hospital day 2, \ncount was 97.  No current evidence of bleeding.  On hospital day \n3 the platelet count was 106.\n.\n# CHRONIC BACK PAIN: Chronic problem, currently stable.  \nPatient's home acetaminophen, oxycontin, gabapentin, and \nlidocaine patch were continued during his hospital stay.\n.\n# GERD \/ Hx GI BLEEDS: Continued home dose of omeprazole \n.\n# GOUT: continue home dose of allopurinol \n.\n# A-FIB: Rate controlled on atenolol.  No aspirin \/ warfarin due \nto history of GI bleeds.  \n.\n# DM: FSG were <200 during the hospitalization.  Patient is \nnormally on Januvia, but that's not available at the pharmacy.  \nPatient was controlled with insulin sliding scale during the \nhospitalization.\n.\n# FUNGAL INFECTION: Patient has evidence of tinea pedis.

The worsen kidney function was likely caused by the antibiotics (Keflex and Bactrim) you were taking for cellulitis (leg infection). Dehydration also may have contributed to your decreased kidney function. We treated you with IV fluids, and we stopped the antibiotics that may have been the cause of the kidney failure. Your kidney function improved throughout your stay here at the hospital. We gave you one dose of vancomycin, another antibiotic that can be used to treat cellulitis."}
