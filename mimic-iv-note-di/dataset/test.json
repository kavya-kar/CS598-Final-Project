He does have \nan occlusion of his right common iliac artery just beyond the \naortic bifurcation. \n\nHip Film ___ Three views show the bony structures and joint \nspaces to be within normal limits and symmetric with the \nopposite side. If there is serious clinical concern for occult \nfracture, cross-sectional imaging could be considered. \n\nMRI L Spine ___: There is normal lumbar vertebral body \nheight and alignment. There is a small hemangioma at L1 \nvertebral body. The conus medullaris is normal in morphology and \nintrinsic signal intensity and terminates at the L1-2 level. \nThere is a normal distribution of cauda equine nerve roots. The \nparavertebral and limited included retroperitoneal soft tissues \nare grossly unremarkable. At L1-L2 and L2-3 there are mild disc \nbulges but no spinal canal stenosis or neuroforaminal narrowing. \nAt L3-L4, there is a disc bulge with a left annular tear \ntouching the left L3 \nnerve root in the left neural foramen. At L4-L5, there is a disc \nbulge with an annular tear on the left. There is also bilateral \nfacet arthrosis which in combination with the disc bulge is \ncausing compression of the right L4 nerve root and also \ncontacting the left L4 nerve root. There is ligamentum flavum \nthickening but no spinal canal stenosis. At L5-S1, there is a \ndisc bulge with an annular tear but no spinal canal stenosis or \nneural foraminal narrowing. \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nThe patient is a ___ yo RHM h\/o prior right parietal IPH (___) \nc\/b seizures, lung cancer (s\/p right lobectomy, chemotherapy, \nradiation), PAF, CKD, HTN, COPD p\/w severe right \nperiorbital\/temporal headache and subsequently sudden onset \naphasia and left hemiparesis. He was transferred from an OSH \nwith a finding of a 3.2 x 2.9 cm right temporal IPH and was \nadmitted to the Neuro ICU for close monitoring and blood \npressure control. His deficits quickly improved but overnight on \n___ he did have some worsening of LLE weakness which had \nresolved by the morning. Repeat ___ showed no change in size \nor extent of the hemorrhage. He was continued on lamotrigine at \na slightly higher dose (175 mg\/150 mg from 150 mg BID) \nconcerning the possibility of increased seizure activity related \nto the hemorrhage. Given concerns regarding the nature of his \nhemorrhage, he had an MRI Brain with contrast which (other than \nthe hemorrhage) showed no underlying obvious mass or vascular \nmalformation. Given his stable neurological examinations and \nhemodynamic stability, he was transferred to the floor wards of \nthe Neurology unit. \n\nNeurosurgery was consulted to perform a diagnostic cerebral \nangiogram to identify a possible arteriovenous dural fistula or \nother cerebral vascular malformation as a possible etiology of \nhis two hemorrhages. This was done following the administration \nof steroids, H1 and H2 blockers as well as a bicarbonate \npreparation given his 1) chronic kidney disease with Cr 1.7-1.8, \nand 2) history of iodine contrast allergy. This also \nunfortunately did not identify an etiology of his \nintraparenchymal hemorrhages. This procedure was complicated a \nsmall groin hematoma that was not noticeable the next day. His \nperipheral pulses remained constant. \n\nHe did complain of some local right sided hip pain which was \nlimiting motion of his right lower extremity. We obtained hip \nfilms and a lumbar spine MRI which showed no acute injury, \nfracture or radicular\/plexus lesion, which was reassuring. He \nalso reassured us that he has had problems with hip pain in the \npast. \n\nOn the day of his discharge, he was able to ambulate with one \nassist. His foley catheter was discontinued. His pain was well \ncontrolled with PO analgesics and he obtained good relief from \nhis pain following one dose of IV toradol. \n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES: \n- Please be sure to have Mr. ___ follow up with Dr. ___ \nDr. ___ at the dates\/times listed below.

Please note \nthat MRI is more sensitive in detecting small intracranial \nlesions. \n\n___ CTA CHEST W&W\/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY: Increased \ndiffuse pulmonary opacities and pleural effusions. The \nappearance and time course favors multifocal infection, rather \nthan metastases. Multiple reactive lymph nodes are present, \nmeasuring 10-12 mm in the para-aortic region, 10-14 mm in the \nprecarinal region, 13 mm in the aortopulmonary window, 10 mm in \nthe subcarinal region, 11 mm in the right hilum, 9 mm in the \nright infrahilar region, 9 mm in the left hilum, and 10 mm in \nthe left infrahilar region. No pulmonary embolus to the \nsegmental levels. Incomplete visualization of subsegmental \npulmonary arteries in the anterior left upper lobe (4:32) and \nposterior basal right lower lobe (4:39), in association with \nfocal pulmonary opacities. These are more likely due to external \ncompression than pulmonary emboli. Large hiatal hernia. \nIncreasing liver metastases, incompletely characterized. \n\n___ MR HEAD W & W\/O CONTRAST: Multiple scattered small \ninfarcts seen in bilateral centrum semiovale, left frontal, both \noccipital white matter, and both cerebella, concerning for acute \nembolic infarcts. No evidence of metastatic disease. \n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ yo F with metastatic pancreatic cancer to liver on home \nhospice presents after a fall.  Also noted to have increased \nconfusion over the past few days.  In the ER, she was found to \nhave bilateral infiltrates on CXR and hypoxia with delirium.  \n \n# Pneumonia - Given delirium with oxygen requirement, CXR was \nperformed which showed bilateral diffuse opacities. In addition \nto oxygen requirement, pt was intermittently tachycardic and \ncomplaining of right-sided chest wall pain, and so CTA was \nperformed, which showed no pulmonary embolus (rather incomplete \nvisualization of subsegmental pulmonary arteries secondary to \nexternal compression from focal pulmonary opacities), but did \nconfirm the diffuse pulmonary opacities and pleural effusions, \nmore indicative of  multifocal infection rather than metastatic \ndisease. A family meeting was held and the decision was made to \nfocus on treatment of the infection empirically to hopefully \nhelp relieve some of the confusion rather than perform invasive \nprocedures that may be potentially harmful. The pt was put on \ntreatment for HCAP (given hospitalization in ___ with \nlevofloxacin, vancomycin, and cefepime for a total 8 day course. \nThe pt remained afebrile and without leukocytosis throughout the \nhospital stay and her oxygen requirement improved from 4L to 2L \nnasal cannula. \n\n# Embolic Stroke - Pt admitted s\/p fall w\/ delirium, and so MR \n___ was performed to assess for metastatic disease with the \nprospect of starting steroid therapy if mets found. However, \nmetastatic disease was not found, but instead multiple embolic \ninfarcts. She had been on Lovenox since admission, which was \nlisted as a home medication (though unclear if pt was taking \nthis at home) and continued upon discharge. \n\n# Goals of care - Family meeting was held (as stated above) to \ndiscuss radiographic findings on this admission. Disease \nprogression was made known to the patient and her family. \nDecision was made to avoid other\/invasive procedures (i.e. \nbronchoscoy, echocardiogram) in hopes that IV antibiotics will \ntreat any current infection and help improve her delirium. \nPlease note that her delirium may worsen if due to underlying \ndisease progression (i.e. metastatic pancreatic cancer). \n\n# Metastatic pancreatic cancer with acute on chronic abdominal \npain: Pt was started on MS CONTIN 15mg twice daily as well as \noxycodone prn. Given her requirement for oxycodone, her MS \nCONTIN was increased to 30mg twice daily on the day of \ndischarge. If she appears somnolent, please decrease this dose \nback down to 15mg twice daily. \n\n# Ulcerative Colitis: Not currently active per recent \ncolonoscopy ___. She wsa continued on sulfasalazine. \n\n# Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis: AST\/ALT mildy increased. AP \nstable. She was continued on ursodiol.  \n\n# GERD: Pt was continued on home omeprazole.\n\n# History of right IJ clot: Pt was continued on home lovenox.\n\n# Depression\/Anxiety - Pt was continued on home venlafaxine, but \nhome ativan was discontinued in case this may have been \ncontributing to the delirium.\n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES\n# Please have pt seen by palliative care re: symptom control, \ngoals of care, and to provide support for the family\n\n# Would consider up-titration of MS CONTIN as indicated\n\n# Recommend follow-up on pending blood cultures\n \nMedications on Admission:\nFrom prior dc summary:  attempted to  reconcile with pt but she \nis uncertain\nursodiol 300 mg 1 po BID\nenoxaparin 60 mg\/0.6 mL Sub-Q 60 mg SQ Q12 hours\ncalcium 500 + D 500 mg (1,250 mg)-200 Units 1 po daily\nlipase-protease-amylase 5,000-17,000-27,000 U ___ caps po TID \nwith meals\nlorazepam 0.5 mg ___ tabs po q6h and qhs prn anxiety\/nausea\nsulfasalazine 500 mg 1 o BID\nomeprazole 20 mg 1 po daily\nvenlafaxine XR 150 mg 2 caps po qam \nibuprofen 200 mg ___ tabs po q6-8h prn back pain\ndocusate sodium 100 mg 1 po BID prn constipation\noxycodone 5 mg ___ tabs po q4h prn pain\npyridoxine 100 mg 1 po daily\nmultivitamin 1 po daily\nfolic acid 1 mg 1 po daily\nmiralax 17 gram\/dose powder po prn constipation\n\n \nDischarge Medications:\n1. ursodiol 300 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO BID (2 times \na day).  \n2. enoxaparin 60 mg\/0.6 mL Syringe Sig: One (1) Injection \nSubcutaneous Q12H (every 12 hours).  \n3.

In addition, an MRI of your ___ was performed, which showed multiple strokes. It is unclear exactly when these strokes occurred but it was recently. You should continue taking the Lovenox you were already on, in order to try to prevent further strokes. It is unclear if your confusion is caused by the pneumonia or the strokes, but it is hopeful that your confusion will improve with treatment of the pneumonia."}

He was \nfound to have positive UA and admitted to medicine for treatment \nof UTI and AMS.\n\n#Pseudomonas UTI: Patient had a chronic indwelling foley \ncatheter for hypotonic bladder since ___ and has had numerous \nUTI's with various organisms. The latest organisms that have \ngrown include Pseudomonas, Providencia, and Klebsiella, all of \nwhich have been sensitive to zosyn. His current presentation of \nAMS, myoclonus, and positive UA is nearly identical to previous \nUTI presentations. His Foley was last changed at ___ \non ___. Foley was changed on day of admission after first \ndose of Zosyn was administered. Treated UTI with Zosyn x 2 days. \nSensitivities showed ciprofloxacin susceptibility, so switched \nto PO ciprofloxacin 500mg BID on ___. He was discharged on \nthis medication to finish a total of 7 days of antibiotics for \ncomplicated UTI.\n\n#Metabolic encephalopathy: On presentation, patient was \nlethargic and oriented x 0, with myoclonus. He could follow some \nsimple commands, was moving all 4 extremities equally, and could \nanswer some yes\/no questions with head nod\/shake. His baseline \nMS according to ___ nursing staff is alert and oriented x2, \nfluentally conversant and appropriate. Given patient's myoclonic \njerks and evidence of UTI on UA along with his history, AMS was \nattributed to metabolic encephalopathy ___ UTI. Per ___ staff, \nhe has had nearly identical symptomatology\/mental status changes \nduring his numerous previous UTIs. By time of discharge, mental \nstatus had improved back to baseline, with patient alert, \noriented to self, place, and situation. He was fluently \nconversant and appropriate.\n\n#NSTEMI - On the evening of ___, patient experienced \nmid-sternal chest pain. Although reproduciblity of chest pain \nwith palpation was suggestive of costochondritis; given his \nextensive coronary history and elevation in troponins (peak of \n0.20), pt. was treated medically as NSTEMI. Unclear if this was \nrelated to clot (type I) or demand ischemia (type II), but given \npatient's history of severe CAD, treated as type I NSTEMI. \nPatient received ASA 325mg, metoprolol, atorvastatin 80mg, \nsupplemental O2, and heparin gtt x 48 hours. At discharge, \ntroponins had downtrended to 0.10 and patient was chest pain \nfree. He will be scheduled for close followup with his \ncardiologist.  \n \n#Right heel stage II pressure ulcer: No evidence of infection. \nWound care consult was obtained.

Change dressing daily.\n\n#Multiple admissions for recurrent UTIs: Patient has been \nadmitted to ___ 54 times for UTIs since placement of Foley \ncatheter in ___. Per urology notes, the reason for Foley \nplacement was \"hypotonic bladder\"; however, patient's daughter \nstates that Foley was placed because of incontinence and \nresultant skin-breakdown\/infections. A primary goal of this \nadmission was to take measures to prevent future UTIs and \nre-admissions for Mr. ___. To this end, his Foley catheter \nwas removed on ___ for a voiding trial. Patient voided \nspontaneously without any evidence of urinary retention for \nremainder of admission. Patient was incontinent. Groin area was \nkept dry and clean with BID cleansing of the area, as well as by \nkeeping a towel above and below the genitals and changing the \ntowel BID. Ketoconazole cream also was applied to genitals, \ninguinal folds, and pannus fold BID. Foley catheter should \nremain OUT at rehab to decrease risk of recurrent UTI. If \npatient demonstrates AMS, complains of suprapubic pain, or does \nnot void for 8 hours, he should be straight cathed. Under no \ncircumstance should Foley catheter be replaced without \ndiscussion with Mr. ___ PCP, ___ MD Phone: \n___ \n \n\n#Depression\/Anxiety- severe per prior notes and geriatrics note: \nHeld mirtazapine and duloxetine in setting of AMS.

She was found to have an inflammatory \njoint effusion and systemic inflammatory markers that were \nconcerning for possible rheumatologic v. infectious cause. ID \nand Rheumatology consulted, and extensive lab panel sent for \ndiagnostic work up (see below). She had joint aspiration of her \nleft knee, which showed TNC 34,100 without crystals or \nmicroorganisms seen on gram stain. Culture no growth to date. \nShe was started on Vancomycin ___ for possible septic arthritis \nwhich was later discontinued due to lack of concerning systemic \nsymptoms or progression of knee effusion. Chest CT showed left \nlower lobe consolidation, so ID was consulted and recommended \nfurther infectious workup. Pulmonology consulted for \nbronchoscopy with BAL\/biopsy ___. ___ positive and \ngiven lack of convincing infectious etiology for her lung \nfindings (per ID), she was switched from IV toradol\/PO naproxen \nto prednisone 20mg to be continued for 1 week, followed by \ndowntitration to 15mg to be continued until Rheumatology follow \nup on ___. She was discharged home without services. \n\nPROBLEM LIST: \n================================= \n#Rheumatoid arthritis\nPatient presented with 1 week of acute on chronic worsening of \ngeneralized weakness and arthralgias. Currently thought to \nrepresent underlying chronic inflammatory polyarthropathy (RA vs\nspondyloarthropathy) with a superimposed reactive arthritis that \nis secondary to infectious URI or pneumonia. She is positive for \nRF, ___ (elevated) and ___ (1:40) and clinical presentation\n(swelling of MCP\/PIP worst in the morning) that could be c\/w \npresentation of RA. Infectious workup of viral causes of \npolyarthralgia has been negative thus far.\n***f\/u BAL studies - Gram stain negative, respiratory flora \nnoted, pending other studies.\n f\/u serologies: Histoplasma, coccidiodes, blastomycosis, \nmycolytic blood cultures, HLA-B27\n quantiferon gold - indeterminate\n***POSITIVE: ___ (titer pending), monospot. \n***NORMAL\/NEGATIVE: - HIV, anaplasma, aspergillus, beta glucan, \nLyme, CMV, EBV VCA IgM, EBNA IgG and parvo IgG (indicating \nprevious infection), HBV, HCV, GC\/Chlamydia, Cryptococcus, TSH, \nANCA. \nShe was switched from IV toradol to prednisone 20mg PO qd at \ntime of discharge given low index of suspicion for infection. \nStarted on calcium supplementation and Vitamin D and continued \non GI prophylaxis with omeprazole. \n\n#Left knee swelling\n#Inflammatory joint effusion\nJoint aspirate with WBC 34,100 with aspirate cultures without \nmicroorganisms, 3+ PMNs. Most likely related to systemic \nmyalgias and arthralgias, but may be a separate process. Less \nlikely osteoarthritis, which rarely presents with inflammatory \nsynovial fluid. L knee x-ray showed joint effusion with no bone \ninvolvement.\n\n#Questionable PNA\nReports one week of cough and sore throat, no fevers. Clinical \npicture does not suggest pneumonia, but chest CT showed \nconsolidation in left lower lobe suggesting pneumonia with small \ncavitating component (later re-read as non-cavitary). TB rule \nout indeterminate on quantiferon gold (L lower lobe would be an \nuncommon site and she does not have risk factors for exposure), \nin addition to other infections, especially in setting of \npotential initiation of immunosuppression for rheumatologic \ndisease. She received one day of levaquin without need for \nadditional antibiotics. Pulm consulted for bronchoscopy ___ \nwith BAL and possible biopsy for better characterization.\n\n#Transaminitis\nElevated ALT, AST, alk phos and abnormal INR with normal Tbili \nis consistent with hepatocellular dysfunction. HBV and HCV \nnegative. Monospot positive which could be contributing.

The headache is described as throbbing and\nposterior in nature (high cervical and low occipital) that\nradiates around the top of her head and then down again to her\neyes.  It is associated with nausea.  It can be worse on the\nright or left side.  It tends to improve when laying down, but\nhas woken her from sleep several times.  The headache can come\nand go throughout the day, with some days much better than\nothers.\n\nFor this, she initially presented to ___ on ___,\nwhere she underwent abnormal LP (WBC 369, RBC 74, protein <6-\ntube 4).  Total protein <6.)  Oepning pressure was not done, but\nreportedly headache did not improve with Tap.  She was admitted\nand initially covered with Acyclovir and ceftriaxone.  Acyclovir\nwas discontinued when HSV PCR returned negative.  Ceftriaxone \nwas\nalso discontinued at around day 5 (when CSF lyme titers were\nnegative, though Serum positive).  She was transitioned to\ndoxycycline and discharged after an 8 day hospital stay feeling\nslightly better with plan to treat for acute lyme.  Of note, the\nlymphocytes from this lumbar puncture were felt to be \n\"atypical\",\nbut reportedly read by a pathologist as \"reactive\".\n\nHer headache remained stable and was slightly improved.  She was\ndischarged from that initial hospitalization on a course of\ndoxycycline which was was converted to cefuroxime (due to nausea\non doxy) to complete the course.\n\nRoughly a week after that first discharge, she was readmitted to\nthe hospital for overnight obs in the setting of worsened\nheadache (as above), which improved on antiemetics and opiates. \nFollowing this discharge (roughly 1 week ago) she was once again\ndoing okay.\n\nMost recently, she was doing \"okay\", until very early the \nmorning\nof this presentation, when at around 1am, she awoke from sleep\nsuddenly with her typical headache.

Coronary angiography in this right \ndominant system demonstrated two vessel disease. The LMCA had a \n30% distal stenosis. The LAD had a ___ proximal stenosis and \na diffuse 70% mid stenosis. The LCx had a 40% proximal stenosis. \nThe stent previously placed in the RCA was widely patent. There \nwas a residual 70-80% lesion in the mid-distal right \nposterolateral branch that extended to the apex. \n2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed moderate systemic \narterial \nhypertension with a SBP of 156mmHg and DBP of 109 mmHg. \n\nECHO: ___, The left atrium is elongated. The estimated right \natrial pressure is ___. There is mild symmetric left \nventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and \nregional\/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Transmitral \nDoppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade I \n(mild) LV diastolic dysfunction. Right ventricular chamber size \nand free wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the \nsinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve \nleaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet \nexcursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets \nare normal. No mitral valve prolapse is seen. Trivial mitral \nregurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic \nhypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. Compared with \nthe prior study (images reviewed) of ___, the findings are \nsimilar. \n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ year old male who presented 6 days after he received a DES to \nthe RCA with chest pain and STEMI. \n \n# CHEST PAIN\/CORONARIES:  On admission, the patient presented \nwith chest pain 6 days status post DES to the right coronary \nartery. EKG showed elevations in the precordial leads concerning \nfor STEMI vs. repolarization abnormality in the setting of \nhypertensive urgency. Troponin and CKMB were negative in the ED. \nCK of 301. Patient was taken for cardiac catheterization and \nthere was 70-80% narrowing of the proximal LAD. Two ___ \nwere placed in the LAD as the lesion was felt to be \nhemodynamically significant. Patient recieved bivalirudin so no \nintegrillin was given. Patient was continued on ASA 325mg Daily, \nPlavix 75mg Daily, Beta Blocker, ACEI and Statin. Post cath \ncheck was unremarkable. The patient continued to have occasional \nepisodes of left-sided chest pain without any associated ECG \nchanges or increases in the cardiac enzymes.  Therefore, it is \nfelt that if this chest pain is cardiac, it is most likely due \nto diastolic hypertension.  It also may be that his chest pain \nis not cardiac in nature, and he was therefore discharged with \nmaalox as well.  The patient will follow up closely with \noutpatient cardiology. \n.  \n# PUMP: Moderate LVH was found on echo ___. During admission \npatient did not have any signs of volume overload. Repeat ECHO \nduring admission showed no major change since previous ECHO with \npreserved LVEF of >55%. No wall motion abnormalities. \n.  \n# RHYTHM: Patient was in normal signs rhythm during this \nadmission. At times patient was bradycardic and overnight ___ \nhad an episode of sinus dysfunction and junctional escape beats. \nThis sinus node dysfunction was thought to be secondary to the \npatients hypertensive medication regimen, mainly atenolol. \nAtenolol was changed to Carvedilol. Patient was continued on \ntelemetry. \n.  \n#  Chronic renal insufficiency: On admission patient's \ncreatinine was at his baseline of 1.5. It was felt that this is \nmost likely secondary to HTN nephropathy. Patient has normal \nprotein\/Cr ratio.  Patient's creatinine was followed after cath \nto assure no contrast nephropathy. Nephrotoxins were avoided. \nBlood pressure was controlled and ___ were continued. \nPatient should follow up as an outpatient with his PCP for \nfasting blood glucose if he has not had one. \n.  \n#  Impaired glucose tolerance: Last HbA1c was 6.4 in ___. \nPt. may benefit from metformin. Patient should follow up with \nfollow up for fasting blood glucose testing as an outpatient. \n.  \n# HTN: Hypertension was poorly controlled with concern for SA \nnode dysfunction secondary to his medical regimen. Overnight on \n___, he had an episode of multiple junctional escape beats and \nbradycardia. Atenolol\/Diltiazem were stopped and Carvedilol was \nstarted. Lisinopril, Losartan, and HCTZ were also continued. His \nblood pressures responded well, although he still continued to \nhave episodes of hypertension.  He was discharged with a \nprescription for a home blood pressure monitoring kit, and he \nshould follow-up his readings with his PCP.  He also was \ncounseled extensively about proper diet and exercise habits to \nhelp control his blood pressure.\n.  \n# Hyperlipidemia: Pt was continued on simvastatin 80mg QHS. \nPatient will follow up as an outpatient in the ___.  \n\nPatient was FULL CODE during this admission.\n \nMedications on Admission:\nAtenolol 100 mg Tablet daily \nClopidogrel 75 mg daily\nColchicine 0.6 mg Tablet Q1H PRN\nDiltiazem HCl 360 mg daily \nGabapentin 200mg daily PRN \nHydrochlorothiazide 25 mg Tablet  daily \nLisinopril 40 mg Tablet daily\nLosartan 100 mg Tablet daily\nSimvastatin 80 mg Tablet QHS\n    * OTCs *             \nAspirin 325 mg Tablet daily\n \nDischarge Medications:\n1.

You had an unchanged EKG (electrocardiogram) from before and your cardiac enzymes were initially negative. However, the doctors were concerned that your stent had clotted or closed. Therefore, you underwent a cardiac catheterization, which showed that your stent was working adequately. The doctors also saw another lesion in one of the main arteries of your heart, so you had 2 drug-eluting stents and good flow aferwards.

Patient with \nreported dyspnea for months which was worsening over the past \nmonth to week. She has no history of COPD or asthma, but was \nvery wheezy, and did not respond to albuterol, prednisone and \nazithromycin as an outpatient. She does have history of \nsignificant lung abscesses s\/p multiple VATS in the past as a \ncomplication of MRSA bacteremia. She was supposed to have repeat \nCT Chest for follow-up but it is unclear if this occurred (not \nin BI system).  Given the chronicity of her symptoms, it is the \nteam chose to rule out superimposed bacterial infection, viral \nrespiratory panel and repeat chest CT to evaluate for recurrent \nabscess\/effusion. Chest CT imaging was preliminary during her \nhospitalization, but suggested respiratory infection \n(bronchiolitis), and no evidence of recurrent abscess or \neffusion. Flu negative. She was initially treated with \nceftaroline and azithromycin while chest imaging was pending (to \ncover for possible recurrent MRSA abscess), and then narrowed to \nazithromycin mono therapy to cover for bronchitis. Clinically \nshe improved in terms of oxygenation, coughing and dyspnea. She \nlikely does have underlying COPD given imaging findings (see \nbelow), though. Ambulatory O2 saturation was checked prior to \nd\/c and found to be 91-94% on room air. She was given duonebs, \nsteroids were held and she was discharged with instructions to \nobtain PFTs as outpatient.\n\n# Emphysema: noted to have centrilobular emphysema on Chest CT. \nLikely ___ smoking given >30 pack year history. Has currently \ncut down to 5 cigarettes\/day. She will need PFTs as outpatient. \nShe was discharged with prn albuterol and spacer. She was \nencouraged to stop smoking, as well.\n\n# Leukocytosis: This was likely ___ to prednisone as outpatient \nversus infection. Resolved with withdrawal of steroids that she \nwas prescribed at OSH ED.\n\n# Opioid use disorder: patient with history of IV heroin abuse \nnow transitioned to methadone maintenance as an outpatient and \n___ outpatient methadone. Her outpatient methadone dose \nwas confirmed to be 80mg PO daily with ___, LPN at ___. \n- f\/u GCMS opioid testing added by lab due to oxycodone assay \ninterference\n\n# DMII: patient transitioned to oral agents (metformin and \nglipzide) as outpatient. Used ISS as inpatient. A1C was 7.6%. \nIncreased glipizide to BID dosing as outpatient.\n\n# HCV: patient diagnosed during ___ with viral load \n9,210,000 IU\/mL at the time. HIV negative.

You were given antibiotics which helped improve your breathing and your cough. We also gave you breathing treatments with medications that can help if you have COPD. We are suspicious that you may have COPD but this needs to be confirmed with testing that you can do after you leave the hospital. When you leave the hospital, you can continue to use the albuterol inhaler that was prescribed to you earlier this week, using it every six hours for wheezing. Albuterol works best when used with a spacer (and is equivalent to the nebulizer version when used with a spacer). We are increasing your glipizide to twice daily to improve your blood sugar control. The CT scan that you had showed a small growth on one of your adrenal glands. This was noted previously during your last hospitalization. The next steps are to have some additional blood work and testing, but does not require you to stay in the hospital."}

While the etiology of the current \nseizure cluster is unclear, without obvious infectious or \nmetabolic trigger, pt has been having a gradual deterioration in \nseizure control over several months. During his last admission, \nthis was attributed to not taking the correct doses of at least \none of his antiepileptics (felbamate). It is not clear whether \nnonadherence played a role this time.\n\n#NEURO: Seizures\nPt's seizures are right-sided simple partial sensory seizures, \nand right-sided partial complex convulsions, likely originating \nfrom the left sensorimotor cortex, the site of his previous \nepilepsy surgery. On previous admissions, his seizures were \nwithout EEG correlate.\nDuring this admission, he has had multiple prolonged seizures, \noften requiring large doses of LZP to break. Pt was transiently \nin the ICU for closer monitoring after a prolonged seizure, for \nwhich he received large doses of LZP. His episodes of seizure \nactivity with similar semiology of right arm, face, and leg \nwhich persisted between ___ per episode.   After the \npatient's ictal episodes, he returned to baseline with some \ngrogginess.  His clobazam was increased on ___ to ___ \nfrom 20mg BID.\nRemaining AEDs were continued at the following doses: FLB \n___ TID, LAC 200 TID, LMT ___ TID, LEV 1000 \nTID.  Nutrition consult was placed for education about the \nketogenic diet - pt will consider. \n\nAED trough levels (LAC, LEV, FLB, LMT) were sent in AM after \narrival:\nLMT 4.1, LEV 6.2.\nIn the long term, will consider repeat epilepsy surgery. Pt seen \nby Dr. ___ admission, and will be presented at epilepsy \nsurgery conference\n\n# CARDIOLOGY\/VASCULAR: \nThe patient was maintained on ASA throughout his hospital \ncourse.  We continued Atorvastatin and Ezetimibe for \nHyperlipidemia.  Toprol XL was also continued for hypertension \nwith good effect.\n\n# PSYCHIATRY: \nA psychiatric consult was placed given the patient's recent \nsuicide attempt by medication.

This was thought to be result of orthostatic \nhypotension secondary to hypovolemia from recent diarrhea and \ndecreased oral intake.  This is likely the reason for her fall.  \nShe was ruled out for acute intracranial bleeding, acute \ncoronary syndrome, acute bleeding (guaiac negative), and \npneumonia.  She remained diarrhea-free while in the hospital.  \nHer initial UA was equivocal, but repeat showed persistent \npyuria with few bacteria.  However, she was without any urinary \nsymptoms.  Urine culture is currently pending, but treatment may \nnot be necessary if she continues to be asymptomatic.  Initially \nshe had evidence of orthostatic hypotension on vital signs, but \nit resolved after receiving about ___ Liters of IV fluid.  Home \nlasix and lisinopril were held.  Her metoprolol succinate was \nlowered to 25 mg daily, and she tolerated well.  She remained \nasymptomatic throughout her stay.  She was strongly encouraged \nto increase her oral intake of fluids to improve her hydration.  \nEnsure was added to her diet after discussing with nutrition.  \nPhysical therapy was consulted and thought patient does not \nrequire home ___.  She was discharged without lasix or lisinopril \nand with lowered dose of metoprolol succinate 25 mg daily.  She \nwas instructed to follow up with her new primary care physician, \nduring which time, she should have repeat electrolytes, \ncreatinine, and Hct repeated.\n\n# Acute on chronic renal failure.  Patient was noted to have \nelevated creatinine, although close to her baseline of 1.8.  It \nwas likely pre-renal with FeNa of 0.98% and improved with \nhydration.  Her lasix and lisinopril were held.  Her medications \nwere dosed renally.  Her discharge creatinine was 1.7.  Her \nnephrologist, Dr. ___, was informed of her admission.  She \nshould have her renal function followed up by her primary care \nphysician.\n\n# Dementia.  While in-house, patient was noted to have memory \nproblems that raised concern for her home safety.  Strong \nrecommendations were made to both the patient and the family \nthat there are safety concerns for her with the progressing \ndementia.  She was recommended to be discharged home with her \ndaughter, ___, with ___.  They family and the patient were \nrecommended to discuss the next step in managing her dementia \nwith her primary care physician in follow up.  \n\n# HTN.  Because of the initial hypotension and the acute on \nchronic renal failure, her antihypertensives were discontinued.  \nHer blood pressure remained within acceptable range without \nwhile in house.  The plan is not to restart her on lasix.  Her \nprimary care physician can reassess her blood pressure in \nfollow-up with possible re-initiation of lisinopril given her \nhistory of coronary artery disease and orthostatic hypotention \nas improved blood pressure control can often prevent orthostatic \nhypotension.  \n\n# Normocytic anemia.  This was thought to be result of her \nchronic renal failure.  Patient's hematocrit was slightly lower \nthan her baseline of around 33.  She was guaiaced negative with \nnormal rectal exam while in-house.  There was no signs of acute \nbleeding.  Of note, she did lose her IV line the evening prior \nto her discharge and led to some bleeding locally from the \ninsertion site.  However, her discharge hematocrit remained \nstable.  It will be important for this to be followed up in the \noutpatient setting and age appropriate screening should be done.\n\n# Gout.  Stable.  Patient's allopurinol dose was changed to 100 \nmg once every other day given the underlying renal disease.  She \nwas discharged on this new schedule.  This can be followed up by \nher primary care physician.\n\n# H\/o coronary artery disease.  Stable.  She was ruled out while \nin the hospital.  She continued with home simvastatin 40 mg \ndaily and baby aspirin 81 mg daily.  Her metoprolol succinate \ndose was decreased to 25 mg daily given orthostatic hypotension \nand prevention of excessive beta blockade.  Her lisinopril was \nheld because of acute renal failure.  However, it will be \nimportant for her blood pressure to be reassessed at follow-up \nas lisinopril can be benefitial for patients with coronary \nartery disease.\n\n# Diarrhea.  Patient completed the 7 day course of ciprofloxacin \nas prescribed to her for the recent diarrhea.  She remained \nsymptom free while in the hospital.\n\nFollow-up tasks:\n[] Follow up with primary care physician to assess the above \nconditions \n[] Follow up on urine eosinophils and urine culture from \n___\n[] Repeat electrolytes, BUN, and creatinine.\n[] Repeat CBC\n \nMedications on Admission:\nallopurinol ___ mg daily  \ncalcitriol 0.25mcg 4 days\/week  \nfolic acid 1mg daily  \nfurosemide 40mg daily (pt reports no longer taking)  \nlisinopril 30mg daily  \nmetoprolol succinate 50mg daily  \nsimvastatin 40mg daily  \naspirin 81mg daily  \nvitamin c 500mg daily \nciprofloxacin for 7 days\n \nDischarge Medications:\n1. allopurinol ___ mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO EVERY OTHER \nDAY (Every Other Day).  \n2. calcitriol 0.25 mcg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO 4 days a \nweek.  \n3. folic acid 1 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).  \n\n4. simvastatin 40 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY \n(Daily).  \n5. aspirin 81 mg Tablet, Chewable Sig: One (1) Tablet, Chewable \nPO DAILY (Daily).  \n6. ascorbic acid ___ mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY \n(Daily).  \n7. metoprolol succinate 25 mg Tablet Sustained Release 24 hr \nSig: One (1) Tablet Sustained Release 24 hr PO DAILY (Daily).\nDisp:*30 Tablet Sustained Release 24 hr(s)* Refills:*2*\n\n \nDischarge Disposition:\nHome With Service\n \nFacility:\n___\n \nDischarge Diagnosis:\nPrimary diagnosis:\n- Orthostatic hypotension\n\nSecondary diagnoses:\n- Chronic renal failure\n- Normocytic anemia\n- Hypertension\n\n \nDischarge Condition:\nMental Status: Confused - sometimes.\nLevel of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.\nActivity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.","summary":"You were admitted to the hospital because you had an episode of fall during which you did not lose your consciousness.

You were found to have what is most likely micturation syncope, in which parasympathetic nerves may be stimulated when urinating, which causes a drop and blood pressure and heart rate, causing you to feel dizzy and to faint. We also noticed that your EKG showed some borderline mild conduction abnormalities but did not notice any concerning arrhythmias while you were monitored in the hospital. We will send you home with a monitor which you can wear for the next few weeks to help track your heart rhythms. In evaluating your heart structure, we found that you have a patent foramen ovale, which is a small channel between the two atria that has little clinical significance. Your overall heart function is normal with exception of a very small part of your left ventricle, which may be consistent with myocarditis, usually a sequelae of a viral infection and is self limited."}

Mild aortic \nregurgitation is present There is no mitral valve prolapse. An \neccentric, posteriorly directed jet of moderate to severe (3+) \nmitral regurgitation is seen due to tethering of the posterior \nmitral valve leaflet. Due to the eccentric nature of the \nregurgitant jet, its severity may be significantly \nunderestimated (Coanda effect). Moderate [2+] tricuspid \nregurgitation is seen. The tricuspid regurgitation jet is \neccentric and may be underestimated. There is mild to moderate \npulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is an anterior \nspace which most likely represents a prominent fat pad. \n\nIMPRESSION: Regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction \nconsistent with multivessel CAD. Moderate to severe, eccentic \nmitral regurgitation due to restricted motion of the posterior \nleaflet. \n\nCompared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, \noverall left ventricular contractile function is improved. An \nImpella catheter is no longer present.  \n\nMICRO\n=====\n___ STOOL C. difficile DNA amplification \nassay-FINAL INPATIENT \n___ MRSA SCREEN MRSA SCREEN-FINAL INPATIENT \n___ SPUTUM GRAM STAIN-FINAL; RESPIRATORY \nCULTURE-FINAL INPATIENT \n___ BLOOD CULTURE Blood Culture, Routine-FINAL \nINPATIENT \n___ BLOOD CULTURE Blood Culture, Routine-FINAL \nINPATIENT \n___ URINE URINE CULTURE-FINAL {KLEBSIELLA \nPNEUMONIAE} \nURINE CULTURE (Final ___: \n      KLEBSIELLA PNEUMONIAE.    >100,000 CFU\/mL. \n         Cefazolin interpretative criteria are based on a dosage \nregimen of\n         2g every 8h. \n\n                              SENSITIVITIES: MIC expressed in \nMCG\/ML\n                      \n_________________________________________________________\n                             KLEBSIELLA PNEUMONIAE\n                             |   \nAMPICILLIN\/SULBACTAM--     8 S\nCEFAZOLIN-------------   <=4 S\nCEFEPIME--------------   <=1 S\nCEFTAZIDIME-----------   <=1 S\nCEFTRIAXONE-----------   <=1 S\nCIPROFLOXACIN---------<=0.25 S\nGENTAMICIN------------   <=1 S\nMEROPENEM-------------<=0.25 S\nNITROFURANTOIN--------    32 S\nPIPERACILLIN\/TAZO-----   <=4 S\nTOBRAMYCIN------------   <=1 S\nTRIMETHOPRIM\/SULFA----   <=1 S\n\nDISCHARGE LABS\n==============\n___ 09:00AM BLOOD WBC-13.4* RBC-3.74* Hgb-10.7* Hct-33.2* \nMCV-89 MCH-28.6 MCHC-32.2 RDW-13.5 RDWSD-43.9 Plt ___\n___ 09:00AM BLOOD Plt ___\n___ 09:00AM BLOOD Glucose-93 UreaN-59* Creat-1.5* Na-136 \nK-3.7 Cl-90* HCO3-30 AnGap-20\n___ 09:00AM BLOOD ALT-85* AST-61* AlkPhos-83 TotBili-0.4\n___ 09:00AM BLOOD Calcium-9.0 Phos-4.9* Mg-2.4\n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ is a ___ lady with CAD s\/p MI (___), HTN, and \nchronic diarrhea admitted with inferior MI c\/b cardiogenic shock \ns\/p DESx2 ___ stabilized with dual pressors and impella device. \nCargiogenic shock resolved and patient was transferred to the \nfloor where she was stable with much improved neurologic status. \nShe initially required tube feeds for nutritional support due to \nswallowing dysfunction but this improved and she was tolerating \na regular diet at discharge.\n\n#CORONARIES: Thrombotic bifurcating lesion at circumflex and \nOM1, s\/p DES x2\n#PUMP:  LVEF 25% \n#RHYTHM: NSR\n\n#Acute on chronic systolic heart failure: LVEF 25%, worsened in \nsetting of infarct, improved with diuresis.

Additionally, \nhe underwent cardiac catheterization with a DES placed to the \nleft circumflex, complicated by embolism in L MCA territory \nwithout persistent neurologic sequelae. \n\n#ESRD: Patient w\/ ESRD s\/p fistula placement presented with \nprogressing symptoms of uremia. His dialysis proceeded \nsuccessfully, with one session delayed for AM nausea which \nresponded well to metoclopramide. PPD was placed and negative, \nhe was started on nephrocaps, and he was transitioned to an \noutpatient TTS schedule. HBV unexposed \n-HBV immunization as outpatient\n\n#Type II NSTEMI: Patient w\/ elevated troponin to 0.16 -> 0.14 on \nfollow up. No evidence of acute ischemic change on ekg, BNP of \n7251. History of past silent inferior MI. Most likely a \ncombination of demand ischemia in setting of HTN as well as \nrenal failure and impaired clearance. However, given his risk \nfactors and history of CAD he was started on a heparin drip and \nwas catheterized with a drug eluting stent placed to the left \ncircumflex, a procedure which had been planned before surgery \nbut delayed until HD initiation given contrast load. Home beta \nblockade was continued, see afterload management below. He was \ndischarged on aspirin and plavix for minimum of 6 months. His \ndischarge metoprolol dose was Metoprolol Succinate 25mg daily \nand atorvastatin 80mg He should not stop these medications until \ntalking to his cardiologist. \n\n#Embolic Ischemic Stroke: Immediately post catheterization, he \nexperienced transient word finding difficulties which fully \nresolved within minutes. The next morning headache and nausea \nprompted a head ct which was negative for acute bleed, but \nsubtle findings prompted an MRI which was most consistent with \nrecent embolic activity in the Left insula and temporal lobe. He \nhad no focal findings beyond his baseline neuropathy and no \nlateralizing signs. \n-No further follow up necessary\n\n#HTN: On 75mg irbesartan at home, was initially covered with \n25mg losartan but remained hypertensive to the 180s and \nhydralazine was added. He became symptomatically orthostatic, \nlikely secondary to his autonomic neuropathy, and when his \nhydralazine was held he became hypertensive to the 200s after \ncatheterization and briefly required a nitroprusside drip. He \nwas discharged on 150mg irbesartan without any hydralazine. \n-Antihypertensive titration\n\n# DM: Used 60 u detemir + aspart sliding scale at home. Last A1c \n7.7 in ___. Past complications include retinopathy, \nneuropathy, autonomic neuropathy and nephropathy. He was \ninitially treated with 60 Lantus BID and sliding scale, with the \nlantus downtitrated secondary to low glucose levels. He is \ndischarged on 40 u  detemir BID plus the sliding scale, with \ninstructions to adjust with his outpatient providers if coverage \nis insufficient. \n-Follow up sugars and adjust detemir accordingly\n\n#GERD: Patient reports worsening over past few months of \nsubsternal chest pain. Brief episodes ~5 seconds of squeezing \npain associated with gasping hiccup. Increased cough over same \nperiod.  Denies dysphagia, possible but less likely to be DES. \n-8 weeks of high dose ppi, to be followed up as outpatient\n-transition to 40mg pantoprazole bid, given omeprazole \ninteraction with clopidogrel.\n\n#Cardiac echo: normal EF with no wall motion abnormalities, as \nwell as mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. Echo with \nmildly dilated ascending aorta, seen in ___ as well. \n-Recommend follow up echo in ___ year\n\n# Anemia: Normocytic, and stable at hgb ___, adequate per \nrenal. Likely secondary to deficiency of renal epo production. \nRecent baseline ___\n-EPO or iron as per his outpatient renal team\n\n#LLQ Pain: Presented with intermittent LLQ pain, with no \nreliable pattern.

She was treated conservatively for sciatica \nwith acetaminophen, ibuprofen, cyclobenzaprine, and a heating \npad but this did not produce any improvement. The patient was \nunable to ambulate and she went to an urgent care clinic 2 days \nlater, where she got IV toradol and her pain was relieved. \nHowever, by the end of the first week, she had worsening of \nsymptoms, was febrile to 100-101, and went to the ED while in \n___ on vacation. She had an XR of the pelvis that was \nunremarkable, and morphine did not provide relief. She was \nultimately given more IV toradol, resulting in enough \nimprovement to get back to ___.\n\nSince that time (3 weeks ago), she had been walking with a \nwalker (no previous history of walking with a walker) due to an \ninability to bear weight on her LLE due to pain. She described \nthe pain as constant in the left lumbar region with intermittent \nspasms down her left leg. She took ibuprofen with some mild \nrelief and her position of comfort was lying on her right hip. \nShe was seen by ___ a couple of weeks ago, who prescribed \nexercises which helped the pain and also noticed left leg \natrophy; patient was also prescribed walker at this time. \nPatient went to spine clinic a week ago, where she received 5 \ndays of prednisone (completed ___, more ___, and ordered an MRI \nL spine for suspected herniated disc. The MRI L-spine showed \nabnormal muscle enhancement and ? SI joint abnormalities. \nFollow-up MRI pelvis on ___ raised concern for septic \nsacroiliitis and she was referred to the ED. \n\nIn the ED, she was tachycardic to 110. She was given \nOxycodone-Tylenol and Ibuprofen for pain. Antibioitcs were \ndeferred. She denied fevers, chills, and night sweats. She \ndenied N\/V\/D.

In \nthe ED, antibiotics were deferred and pain control was achieved \nwith percocet and ibuprofen. As an inpatient, ___ sampled the \nfluid collection for gram stain and culture and a bone marrow \nbiopsy was also obtained. Because it was unclear why she has \ndeveloped this fluid collection with no history of IV drug use \nor foreign bodies, ID was consulted. Given the suspicion for \ninfectious sacroiliitis, the decision was made to treat her \nempirically with Ceftriaxone for 6 weeks as no other compelling \netiology presented itself and her clinical syndrome certainly \nmay be consistent with infection. A PICC line was placed and ID \nprovided instructions for at-home antibiotics administration and \nlabs below (in transitional issues). She achieved adequate \nrelief of her pain with percocet.

Multiple small hypodensities are also again noted, \nmost of which\nare too small to further characterize, but unchanged. No new \nliver lesions\nnoted. Although not optimally evaluated on this study, the main \nportal vein\nappears patent, with possible narrowing of the right branch, \nunchanged.\nExtensive collaterals with splenorenal shunt, gastric varices \nand splenic\nvarices are noted. There is trace ascites, decreased from prior. \nSpleen is\nborderline enlarged.\n \nPancreas and bilateral adrenal glands are unremarkable. The \nkidneys enhance\nand excrete contrast symmetrically without evidence of \nhydronephrosis or\nhydroureter. Small hypodensities in bilateral kidneys are too \nsmall to\nfurther characterize but likely represent simple cysts. Loops of \nsmall bowel are fluid filled but normal in caliber. Air-fluid \nlevels are noted throughout the colon and is nonspecific but \ncould indicate gastroenteritis. No bowel wall thickening or \nevidence of obtruction. No free air in the abdomen. No \nmesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy meeting CT \ncriteria for pathologic enlargement.\n \nCT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: Foley catheter is noted within the \nbladder, but\nthe urinary bladder and distal ureters are unremarkable. There \nis a left\nfat-containing inguinal hernia. Calcified uterine fibroids and a \npessary\ndevice are noted. Sigmoid diverticulosis without evidence of \nacute\ndiverticulitis. There is stool and fluid within the sigmoid \ncolon and\nrectum. There is no free fluid in the pelvis. No pelvic or \ninguinal\nlymphadenopathy meeting CT criteria for pathologic enlargement.\n \nBONE WINDOWS: No suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous lesions \nidentified.\nThere is multilevel degenerative change of thoracolumbar spine, \nmost prominent at L4-5. Persistent compression deformity of L1 \nis again noted.\n \nIMPRESSION:\n \n1. Fluid filled colon and some fluid filled loops of small bowel \ncould\nindicate gastroenteritis, otherwise no acute intra-abdominal or \npelvic\nabnormality to explain the patient's symptoms.\n \n2.

Altered mental status: Likely due to hepatic encephalopathy.  \nHer daughters are very aware of her mental status and her signs \nand symptoms of encephalopathy.  When she became confused, they \ngave her 4 doses of lactulose.  She did not stool, so she was \nbrought to the ED.  While in the ED they did pan cultures and a \nchest x-ray.  From the blood cultures, one bottle came back \n(___) after her discharge positive for corynebacterium, but was \nlikely due to contamination.  She was afebrile and at baseline \nwhen she was discharged.  On chest x-ray she was found to have a \nretrocardiac opacity that was consistent with pneumonia.\n.\n#. Pneumonia: Retrocardiac opacity of chest x-ray consistent \nwith pneumonia found during sepsis screen in ED.  She was \ntreated with levofloxacin for the infection and she became more \nalert and returned to her baseline mental function.  She was \nafebrile throughout her stay with us.  While here there was \nconcern for aspiration.  Speech and swallow evaluated her with \nbedside and video exams.  She was cleared for normal diet.  On \ndischarge she was back to her baseline.\n.\n#.

He did not \nhave any right calf swelling or tenderness to palpation.  Given \nhis hypercoagulable state and prior history of DVTs & PE, he was \nstarted on a heparin drip and admitted to the floor for further \nevaluation.  His lower extremity ultrasound studies showed that \nhe has a peripheral partially occlusive DVT in the mid-portion \nof the right superficial femoral vein, but the chronicity (vs. \nacuity) of this clot could not be determined.  Hematology was \nconsulted to assist in the evaluation & treatment of Mr. ___ \nsymptoms.  Given that the clot was in the distribution of his \nprior clot (imaged in ___ and his symptoms of leg \nfullness spontaneously resolved on hospital day two,  it was \nthought that the DVT imaged on his ultrasound was chronic rather \nthan acute.  As such, he was deemed safe to discharge home by \nboth the hematology team & the primary medical team.  Hematology \nthought that Mr. ___ might benefit from a slightly higher INR \ngoal of 2.5 - 3.5, but realization of this goal was deferred to \nhis outpatient hematologist & PCP.  \n\nCHRONIC DIAGNOSES:\n\n# Coronary Artery Disease: The patient denied chest pain, \nshortness of breath, and palpitations.  He was monitored on \ntelemetry for the duration of his short hospitalization.  He was \ncontinued on his home aspirin regimen.\n\n# Ulcerative Proctitis:  The patient stated that he recently had \na flare which has since resolves.

An outpatient work-up \nhad been in progress; however, patient reported that his primary \ncare physician was concerned that more agressive intervention \n(possibly TPN) would be necessary. Review of patient's outside \nrecords revealed an extensive work-up including EGD, biopsy, \nenteroscopy, colonoscopy, CT, MRI, fecal fat studies, ___, \nlactoferrin, fatty acids, and basic metabolic panels were all \nnormal. The only abnormal result from outside facilities had \nbeen a gastric emptying study reported as having 13% emptying in \na 90 minutes period. At ___, nutrition and gastroenterology \nwere consulted. Nutrition consult recommended oral feeding with \nsupplementation with Ensure. They also requested a calorie count \nto be initiated; however, this was unrevealing prior to \npatient's discharge as the calories for only a couple of meals \nwere counted. Gastroenterology in consult felt that the patient \ndeserved a completion of his work-up of gastric and bowel \nmotility prior to further consideration of TPN. Another \ncomplicating issue about TPN is that the patient did not meet \ninsurance requirements to be initiated on TPN. Gastroenterology \nalso felt that medical management had not been exhausted as the \npatient had not been on antiemetics other than a short course of \nmetoclopramide. Also, the patient had never tried erythromycin \nfor motility. Gastroenterolopgy also raised the possibility that \nthis could represent a functional disorder. Patient was \ndischarged with intention of completing outpatient work-up to \ninvestigate a motility disorder prior to further consideration \nof enteral vs. parenteral feedings. Patien was set up to have \ngastric emptying study on ___ to be followed by an \noutpatient appointment with Gastroenterology. Of note, while \npatient was hospitalized, he had multiple lab studies including \nUPEP and SPEP  which were unrevealing of etiology. Iron studies, \nb12, cholesterol, and TSH were normal.

Pt found to have parenchymal \nhematoma in the right frontal lobe deemed stable by neurosurgery \nwith no acute management needed. Also with multiple fractures of \nRUE. Admitted to medicine and thought to have orthostatic \nsyncope ___ meds and question of autonomic insufficiency. \nEventually responded to PO midodrine and transferred to skilled \nrehab facility.\n.\nActive Issues:\n#Syncope: Differential included CNS, cardiac, vasovagal, and \northostatic causes. Head CT at ___ negative \nfor any mass lesions, however, was positive for parenchymal \nhematoma (see below). Patient was monitored on telemtry for 24 \nhours, which showed no ectopy or other arrhythmias that could be \nunderlying cause. TTE showed no structural abnormalities. Her \nhistory of syncope when going from sitting to standing position \nafter working outside was very concerning for orthostatic \nsyncope. Orthostatics were checked and positive for decrease of \n20mm SBP, and increase of 20bpm HR. Appeared slightly \nhypovolemic, and was given 2L NS with little response. Thought \nthat BP meds might be cause so atenolol and methyldopa were \nheld, again, with little response in orthostasis. Neurology \nconsulted with recommendation for outpatient autonomics work-up. \nIn the meantime recommended compression stockings, and sitting \non edge of bed for 5 minutes before standing. Orthostasis \nfinally responded to 2.5mg midodrine TID w\/meals. Discharged on \nthis medication and restarted on atenolol and lisinopril to \ncombat supine hypertension (see below). No symptoms of \ndizziness, lightheadedness, or syncope while an in-patient.\n.\n#Hypertension: Patient came in taking methyldopa, atenolol, and \nlisinopril. Methyldopa immediately held as this predisposes to \northostatic hypotension and numerous other side effects in the \nelderly population. Atenolol also held ___ blunted tachycardic \nresponse. Pt had some rebound hypertension with SBP >180, which \nwas successfully treated with multiple doses of IV labetalol and \nIV hydralazine. Lisinopril was titrated up to 40mg qday with \ngood BP control. Although midodrine controlled orthostasis, pt \nwas still in sinus tachycardia. Low dose atenolol was restarted \nand pt HR ___ at discharge. \n.\n#R. vertebral artery occlusion: Pt with total occlusion of R. \nvertebral artery. Evaluated by neurology, who believed this to \nbe chronic and not acute. Not a cause of orthostasis. Started on \nASA and will follow up with neurovascular surgery.\n. \n#Parenchymal Hematoma: Pt with right frontal intraparenchymal \nhematoma on head CT at OSH. Transferred to ___ for this \nreason, and evaluated by neurosurgery. Seen in ED and no \nintervention or additional imaging performed. Bleed was deemed \nto be stable and patient had no focal neurological deficits. Has \nfollow-up with neurosurgery as an outpatient\n.\n#RUE fractures: Pt noted to have R. radial fracture and R. \nscaphoid fracture. Seen by orthopedics and placed in sling for \nradial fracture, with instructions for full ROM exercises and \nweight bearing <5 pounds. Scaphoid fracture treated with Right \nthumb spica splint.

On admission, patient with diarrhea (4x \nin 8 hours) and a WBC of 19.7. A WBC that high is usually \nsuggestive of c. diff, however the CBC on admission appears to \nbe spurious lab values given that all CBC quantities (WBC, hct, \nplts) dropped excessively on repeat and remained stable there \nafter. Patient was empirically started on flagyl 500mg IV TID \nfor a day, prior to c. diff coming back negative.  It was then \ndiscontinued.  Patient's repeat WBCs were within normal range \n(8.1 on day 2) and patient remained with occasionally low grade \nfevers (to 100.4).  Within 2 days, patient's diarrheal output \ndecreased and even ceased by the time of discharge. Of note \n___ reports an outbreak of viral gastroenteritis, as \nwell as an outbreak of c.diff, per report.  The patient most \nlikely has a viral gastroenteritis and this has resolved. She \nwas given IVFs to rehydrate and returned to her nursing home \nonce the diarrhea had resolved.\n.  \n# Nausea:  Patient was nauseous prior to arrival to the \nhospital, however once in the hospital, patient denies any \nnausea and was without episodes of vomiting. Symptoms were \nlikely related to her gastrointestinal infection. Initially \npatient was maintained on sips, however diet was advanced to \nfull once it was clear she had resolution of her symptoms.\n.  \n# Tachycardia: Patient with paroxysmal afib on coumadin, \nmetoprolol and digoxin (recently increased to 0.25mg daily). She \nwas given extra metoprolol in the ED for an increased heart rate \n(120s). HR remained in the 100s-110s, but decreased initially \nwith IVFs. Patient was monitored on telemetry and home \nmetoprolol (25 TID), digoxin (0.25 daily) and warfarin 2.5mg \ndaily were administered. INR ranged from 1.8-1.9 over admission. \nPatient sees cardiology as an outpatient and last recorded note \nmentions considering cardioversion if this continues 6wks out \nfrom her appointment. Heart rate was relatively well controlled \n(SBP 100s), so not further action was taken.\n.\nChronic Issues:\n# DM: No recent HgbA1c in the system. Patient's metformin was \nheld, glargine 10units Qhs was given and patient was covered \nwith an HISS. ASA was also continued.\n.\n# HTN: continued home metoprolol and lisinopril.  Patient \nremained normotensive on regimen.\n.\n# HL: continued home simvastatin.\n.  \n#FEN: continued iron, Vit D and folate supplementation.

There is mild symmetric \nleft ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is \nmildly dilated with mild-moderate regional systolic dysfunction \nwith severe hypokinesis of the basal half of the inferior and \ninferolateral walls and inferior septum. The remaining segments \ncontract well (LVEF = 35 %). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an \nincreased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right \nventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The \naortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic \nvalve leaflets are severely thickened\/deformed. There is \nmoderate aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.0-1.2cm2). Mild \n(1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The aortic regurgitation jet \nis eccentric, directed toward the anterior mitral leaflet. The \nmitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral \nvalve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The \nestimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is high normal. \nThere is no pericardial effusion. \n\nIMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mild left ventricular \ncavity dilation with regional systolic dysfunction c\/w CAD (PDA \ndistribution). Moderate aortic valve stenosis. Mild aortic \nregurgitation. Mild mitral regurgitation. Increased PCWP. \nDilated aortic sinus. \n\nCompared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable \nfor review) of ___, aortic stenosis is now present, the \nleft ventricular cavity is now mildly dilated, and the severity \nof aortic stenosis has increased. \n\nCLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: \nThe patient has moderate aortic valve stenosis. Based on ___ \nACC\/AHA Valvular Heart Disease Guidelines, if the patient is \nasymptomatic, a follow-up echocardiogram is suggested in ___ \nyears.  \n\n___ Carotid Ultrasound\nThere is right antegrade vertebral artery flow. \nThere is left antegrade vertebral artery flow. \n  \nImpression: Right ICA with no stenosis. \n                    Left ICA with <40% stenosis. \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ with CAD s\/p PTCA in ___ with repeat catheterization in \n___ showing 2-vessel disease, ischemic cardiomyopathy with LVEF \n25% s\/p ICD placement, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type II \ndiabetes, and moderate AS here presents with progressive chest \npressure\/pain with exertion over the past several months found \nto have NSTEMI, 3-vessl coronary artery disease and moderate \naortic stenosis best managed by coronary artery bypass graft \nsurgery. \n\n# NSTEMI\nTroponins mildly elevated to 0.06 by third set, no ECG changes \nconsistent with ischemia. He was placed on a heparin drip for 48 \nhours. Cardiac catheterization revealed significant 3-vessel \ndisease most amenable to treatment with CABG. Cardiothoracic \nsurgery was consulted, and their pre-operative recommendations \nwere carried out. They scheduled him for CABG\/aortic valve \nreplacement as below on ___. Given the length of time \nuntil surgery, Mr. ___ was evaluated for his ability to \ngo home. He was able to ambulate around the medical floor as \nwell as up one flight of stairs without angina. He was \ndischarged home with a new prescription of isosorbide \nmononitrate to limit his angina with exertion as well as \naspirin, atorvastatin 80 mg (switched from simvastatin 40 mg), \nand his home carvedilol, furosemide and lisinopril. Mr. \n___ was provided with detailed instructions about \nsymptoms that should prompt him to present to the emergency \ndepartment.\n\n# Aortic Stenosis\nModerate aortic stenosis found on TTE. As this will likely \nrequire intervention in the next few years, Mr. ___ will \nget aortic valve replacement along with his CABG. He has decided \nthat he wants to have a mechanical aortic valve replacement for \nits longevity, and he is willing to be on coumadin.\n\n# Rate related left bundle branch block\nInitial ECG upon presentation with heart rate of 83 revealed \nleft bundle branch block. Block resolved with decrease in heart \nrate. \n\n# ischemic cardiomyopathy\nThroughout his admission there was no evidence of decompensate \nheart failure. He was continued on his home lasix dose. His \nlisinopril was initially held as explained below, but he was \ndischarged on his home regimen as detailed above.\n\n# acute kidney injury\nUpon presentation Mr. ___ creatinine was 1.5. Urine \nlytes resulted in a fractional excretion of urea of 40%. His \nlisinopril was held and his creatinine improved in one day to \n1.2. His lisinopril was restarted after the improvement in his \ncreatinine.

There is physiologic mitral \nregurgitation. Due to acoustic shadowing, the\nseverity of mitral regurgitation could be UNDERestimated. The \ntricuspid valve leaflets are mildly\nthickened. There is moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation by \ncolor Doppler; however, there appears to be\nsystolic flow reversal in the hepatic veins suggestive of severe \ntricuspid regurgitation. There is moderate\nto severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. .There is no \npericardial effusion. Bilateral pleural\neffusions are present.\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nPatient admitted to the trauma surgical ICU for respiratory \nmanagement in the setting of her traumatic injuries. She was \ngiven 2U FFP and Vitamin K in the emergency department. She was \nstarted on a Dilaudid PCA for pain control. On ___ she was \nagain given FFP and vitamin K in an effort to reduce her INR so \nshe could have an epidural placed, however her INR was still \n1.5. She was given liquids which she tolerated. The following \nday, ___, her INR was 1.2 and an epidural was placed. She did \nhave a ground level fall at the time of the epidural placement \nwithout headstrike and was neuro intact with no further injuries \nidentified on exam. She was started on lasix diuresis. On ___ \nshe had a hypotensive episode with bilateral parasthesias of the \nlower extremities in the setting of her epidural which was then \ndiscontinued with resolution of her symptoms and hypotension. \nThe epidural was removed ___. On ___, an erector spinae \ncatheter was placed by APS, she was given an aggressive bowel \nregimen and had a BM, and was transferred to the floor. \n\nOn ___, the patient had an acute worsening of her respiratory \nstatus, thought to be multi-factorial with differential \nincluding splinting, COPD exacerbation, CHF exacerbation and \npneumonia. She was transferred to the intensive care unit for \nrespiratory monitoring and started on IV diuresis and \nantibiotics. Her respiratory status stabilized and she was \nweaned from supplemental oxygen to room air. She was also noted \nto have abdominal distension with KUB suggesting ileus, and NGT \nwas placed with >1L feculent appearing output. \n\nDuring the course of her second ICU admission, Ms ___ was \nnoted to have a pleural effusion that would likely require \nplacement of a pigtail cathether in order to aid her respiratory \ndistress. In conversation with the patient and her family \nmembers as well as with the palliative care service, the \ndecision was made to avoid escalation of care and initiation of \nfurther procedures.  Ultimately, the patient decided she would \nlike to transition to completely comfort focused care.  In \nkeeping with her wishes, all preventative and non-comfort \nfocused medicines and interventions were ceased.  This included \ncessation of lab draws, telemetry, and anticoagulation \nmedications.  \n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

The \nventricles and \nsulci are slightly prominent, likely age related and \ninvolutional in nature.  \nAreas of low attenuation are identified in the subcortical and \nperiventricular \nwhite matter, likely consistent with chronic microvascular \nischemic changes.  \nThe orbits demonstrate lens replacement. The sinuses and bony \nstructures are \ngrossly normal. \n  \nIMPRESSION: Small rounded high density focus in the right \nfrontal lobe \n(Series 2:image 20) likely artifactual in nature, otherwise, \nthere is no \nevidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage, mass, mass effect or \nshifting of \nthe normally midline structures. \n  \nCTA OF THE HEAD: There is evidence of vascular flow in both \ninternal carotids \nand vertebrobasilar system with no flow stenotic lesions or \naneurysms larger \nthan 2 mm in size. Bilateral atherosclerotic calcifications are \ndemonstrated \nin the carotid siphons.  \n  \nThe neck vessels demonstrates patency of the supra-aortic \nvessels with \npunctate atherosclerotic calcifications in both carotid cervical \nbifurcations, \nno significant stenoses are identified, the inner lumen of the \nproximal \ninternal carotid on the right measures approximately 7.1 mm and \ndistally \nmeasures 3.6 mm. with significant tortuosity of the right \ninternal carotid \nartery.  \n  \nThe left common carotid artery appears patent with no flow \nstenotic lesions.  \nPunctate calcifications are noted in the cervical bifurcation. \nThe inner \nlumen of the left carotid artery in the proximal segment \nmeasures \napproximately 7.2 mm and distally 4.2 mm. \n  \nBoth vertebral arteries are patent with mild narrowing at the \norigin of the \nleft vertebral artery. \n  \nDense calcifications are identified in the aortic arch. The \nvisualized aspect \nof the thyroid gland is unremarkable. The upper chest images \ndemonstrates \nspiculated opacity with air bronchogram in the left upper lobe \nwith irregular \ncontours and associated atelectasis, is concerning for a mass \nlesion vs. \nconsolidation, correlation with a dedicated CT of the chest is \nrecommended for \nfurther characterization. \n  \n  \nMultilevel degenerative changes identified in the cervical \nspine, more \nsignificant at C6 level with anterior wedging, a posterior \nelectrode is noted \nin the posterior thecal sac, terminating at the level of C3. \n \n  \nIMPRESSION: There is no evidence of flow-stenotic lesions in the \nintracranial \nvessels. In the neck there are punctate vascular calcifications \nat the \ncervical carotid arteries involving the cervical bifurcations \nwith no \nsignificant stenosis.Minimal narrowing is noted at the origin of \nthe left \nvertebral artery, possibly related with soft plaque.  \n  \nSpiculated opacity with air bronchogram in the left upper lobe \nwith irregular \ncontours and associated atelectasis, is concerning for a mass \nlesion vs. \nconsolidation, correlation with a dedicated CT of the chest is \nrecommended for \nfurther characterization. \n \n  \nMultilevel degenerative changes identified in the cervical spine \nas described \nabove, more significant at C6, with anterior wedging. A \nposterior electrode is \nnoted in the thecal sac, terminating at the level of C3. \n.\n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nHospital Course per Neurology: Ms. ___ was admitted \novernight ___ to neurology service.  She had an \ninitial NIHSS of 4, but the outside hospital elected not to \npursue thrombolysis.  Her symptomatology could be consistent \nwith a lacunar stroke, however she cannot receive MRI with DWI, \ndue to a non-MRI compatible implant placed by ___ Pain \nClinic for post-herpetic neuralgia.  She was started on heparin \ngtt for atrial flutter, and had supra-therapeutic PTT's.  A UA \nreturned overnight, which was consistent with UTI and the pt. \nwas atrted on ceftriaxone.  On physical exam ___ a.m. she was \nfound to have diffuse edema, ascites, an S3 and was given an \nextra dose of lasix.  It was felt her weakness was actually \nisolated right deltoid weakness, and her dysarthria was \npartially secondary to titubation.  A medicine consult was \nobtained to assist in managing what appears to be CHF \nexacerbation and UTI with the possibility of a lacunar stroke. \n\nHopsital course on Medicine: Pt was admitted to the medicine \nfloor and her deficits began to improve. She initially was \ndyspneic requiring 2L O2 with diffuse wheezing and bibasilar \ncrackles. Given one dose of lasix but later held given low BP \n(goal was to keep SBP>120 in order to maintain brain perfusion). \nShe was given nebulizer treatment which improved her breathing. \nOn the second day, she was weaned to room air and had O2 sats \n94-95% with much more comfortable breathing. It is likely that \nCOPD and CHF are both contributing to baseline dyspnea for her \nand her exacerbation was likely due to not having taking her \nmeds on day of admission. On dishcarge her lungs were still \nslightly wheezy and she responded well to nebulizers \n(ipratropium). No pulm edema or leg edema clinically.\n\nSpeech\/swallow, physical therapy, occupational therapy were all \nfollowing and recommendations followed.\n\nRenal function was improving after transfer to medicine (Cr \n1.4-->1.2), Foley was removed, and we continued treating for UTI \n(urine culture + E coli), switching from ceftriaxone to \nciprfloxacin (cipro total of 3 days). Acute renal insufficiency \nlikely ___ poor forward flow and UTI, baseline not known but \ntrending down prior to discharge.\n\nPt had one episode of a flutter on neurology floor which \nresolved with IV lopressor. She was continued on metoprolol 25mg \nTID and monitored on telemetry. She had no further episodes and \nHR was ___. We discussed at length between the primary team \nand neurology service the benefit vs risk of starting her on \nanticoagulation therapy with heparin brdiging to coumadin. A TTE \nshowed no source of cardiac emboli. It was decided that her \nstroke was most likely lacunar and not embolic in nature and \ngiven no history of arrhythmia and no source on TTE and limited \nnature of atrial flutter (not atrial fibrillation) that \nanticoagulation therapy would not be beneficial given increased \nbleeding risk. She was started on aggrenox for secondary stroke \nprevention and should follow up with neurology at ___ (appt \npending).\n\n \nMedications on Admission:\nASA 81 Qday\nMetoprolol 25mg TID\nLasix 20mg PO Qday\nLovastatin 40mg Qday\nGabapentin 300mg BID\n \nDischarge Medications:\n1.

A CT scan of your head did not show any bleeding or clots in vessels. You did not receive tPA therapy because it was not within the time window for lytic therapy. You were admitted to the neurology floor and then transferred to the medicine floor after developing some shortness of breath. You were also found to have a urinary tract infection. On the medicine floor, we gave you lasix to take some fluid off your lungs and nebulizer treatments to help your breathing. It seems that you have elements of heart failure and COPD that contribute to your difficulty breathing and you responded very well to the nebulizer treatments. We treated your urinary tract infection with ciprofloxacin which you should continue for 2 more days after you leave the hospital. Your renal function has been improving during your stay and we have been holding your lasix now because your lungs sound dry. Your urine grew E coli and we started you on ciprofloxacin for the infection. Right after your admission you also had atrial flutter, an arrhythmia in your heart rate which resolved with IV metoprolol. You did not have any more episodes on the floor. Initially we started you on blood thinners (heparin and coumadin) because we were concerned that your stroke may have been from a thrombus in your heart (embolic). However, an echo was done and did not show a source for embolus and the neurology team believes your stroke was a lacunar one (meaning a small vessel stroke from chronic hypertension). Because you did not have any more episodes of arrhythmia, we decided it wasn't worth the risk to start you on anticoagulation with such a low chance for an embolic event in the future. We did start you on aggrenox, another kind of blood thinner which you should take to prevent recurrence of your kind of stroke. You should also take a rate controlling medication called metoprolol (37.5mg three times a day) to prevent arrhythmias."}

However, patient developed a drug rash to Unasyn which \nhad happened to her previously. Unasyn was changed to Vancomyin \nand Meropenem and the patient clinically improved with \nimprovement in rash, reduced pain and swelling, resolution of \nfever, and normalization of white blood cell count. The patient \nwas seen by the Infectious Disease service who recommended \nchanging to Linezolid to continue a 10 day course of po \nLinezolid following discharge to end ___. DVT was ruled out \nwith lower extremity duplex ultrasound. Arterial duplex studies \nwere read preliminarily as normal with final read pending at \ndischarge.\n\n#Tinea Pedis:\nIt was felt that maceration between ___ and ___ toes due to \ntinea infection was the cause of the patient's cellulitis. Given \nthe mildly elevated in aminotransferase levels (see below), the \npatient was instructed to discontinue topical terbinafine (which \nshe had been taking prior to admission) and the patient was \nprescribed clotrimazole cream to take for at least a two week \ncourse with ultimate course to be determined by PCP as she may \nbenefit from indefinite topical antifungals given her recurrent \ninfections leading to severe cellulitis. Patient was instructed \nnot to start antifungal cream until she has completed her \nLinezolid to avoid any drug-drug interactions. Patient was \ninstructed to follow up with her PCP since if the fungal \ninfection is not treated appropriately with topical medication, \nshe may benefit from systemic therapy once she has completed her \ncourse of Linezolid. A1c was wnl.\n\n#Cough\/GERD:\nPatient experienced dry cough without shortness of breath during \nhospitalization which was felt to be due to GERD. She was \nstarted on PPI and was instructed to follow up with her PCP.\n\n#Transaminitis:\nThe patient did not have liver chemistries checked on admission, \nbut liver chemistries on the morning prior to initiation of \nLinezolid showed mild elevation in the ALT and AST with normal \nALK and TB. It was felt this was most likely related to previous \nmeropenem and unasyn use. As above, given that these labs were \ndrawn prior to her first dose of Linezolid it was felt that the \nelevated liver chemistries were not due to Linezolid. The LFTs \ncould potentially be due to topical terbinafine that the patient \nhad been using prior to discharge, but this was felt to be less \nlikely. The aminotransferase levels were not normal at \ndischarge, but the patient was asymptomatic without fevers, \nabdominal pain, RUQ tenderness, or nausea. The patient was \ndischarged to have these labs followed by her PCP and ___ \n___ clinic with ___ to check labs and fax the \ninformation to ___ post ___ clinic the day prior to her follow up \nappointment. Patient was instructed to call her PCP if she \nexperiences any abdominal discomfort, nausea, fevers, or \njaundice.\n\n#CODE: FULL\n\n#Disposition:\nPatient was discharged home with ___ services for wound care and \nto have labs drawn prior to her post ___ clinic visit.

Intracranial flow voids are maintained. There is a \nnonspecific \nleft frontal periventricular hyperintensity without enhancement. \nA faint \nlesion is also seen in the right parietal area which could \nrepresent partial volume averaging with the ventricle. \n  \nMucosal thickening is also seen in the sphenoid sinus.There is \nmucosal \nthickening in the bilateral ethmoid and right maxillary sinuses. \nMinimal \nright mastoid opacification is noted. \n  \nNo evidence for acute ischemia or hydrocephalus. \n  \nIMPRESSION: \n  \nNo definite seizure focus identified. \n  \nArea of gliosis in the left frontal periventricular ___ matter \nwithout \nenhancement. This could be related to remote nonspecific \ninsult.Appearance is not classic for demyelination although this \ncannot be entirely excluded. \n.\nParanasal sinus opacification as detailed. \n.\nEEG (___):\nROUTINE SAMPLING: The background activity shows a symmetric \n___ Hz \nalpha rhythm which attenuates with eye opening. Frequently, \nthrough the \ncourse of recording, there are intermittent bursts of bilateral \ncentral \nand posterior temporal theta frequency slowing. These bursts, at \ntimes, \nonly appear over the left hemisphere, e.g. at 7:55:13. Of note, \nthe \nstudy is reviewed under the electrode setting \"T1T2CzRI-Univ \n[PTC] 40\" \nto normalize the placement of the electrodes, as the study was \nrecorded \nusing an amplifier without a headbox. \nSPIKE DETECTION PROGRAMS: There were no automated spike \ndetections. \nSEIZURE DETECTION PROGRAMS: There were 52 automated seizure \ndetections \npredominantly for electrode and movement artifact. There were no \n\nelectrographic seizures. \nPUSHBUTTON ACTIVATIONS: There are five pushbutton activations. \nFor the \nentry at 08:36, the EEG shows no electrographic seizures. On \nvideo, the \npatient is being examined by the neurology team. \nFor the entry at 09:06, EEG shows no electrographic seizures \nand is instead captures myogenic artifact. On video, the patient \nis \nstaring while the right hand is shaking. \nFor the entry at 09:54, EEG shows no electrographic seizures \nit captures myogenic artifact. On video, the patient has slow \ntrunk \nflexion-extension movements while saying \"no, I cannot control \nit.\" \nThe entries at 13:06 and 13:07 capture the onset and offset of \nthe same event. For these, EEG shows rhythmic movement artifact \nlasting \n40 seconds with immediate return to normal background after \ncessation of \nthe movements and no seizures are seen. On video, the patient is \nlying \non her left, develops whole truncal shaking, followed by \nopisthotonus \nposturing with neck and back hyperextension. \nFor the entry at 14:04, the EEG shows rhythmic movement \nartifact with superimposed myogenic artifact, but no \nelectrographic \nseizures. On video, patient has body trembling while sitting in \nbed, \nsaying \"I cannot help it\" to her visitor. She then slides down \nin bed \nwith bilateral ___ shaking and develops back-and-forth head \nmovement as \nshe hyperventilates. \nSLEEP: The patient progressed from wakefulness to stage II, then \nslow \nwave sleep at appropriate times with no additional findings. \nCARDIAC MONITOR: Showed a generally regular rhythm with an \naverage rate \nof 75 bpm. Note is made of heart rate increasing to 100-120 bpm \nduring \npushbutton events. \nIMPRESSION: This is an abnormal video EEG because of \nintermittent \nbursts of slowing in the bilateral central and posterior \ntemporal \nregions during wakefulness and drowsiness which, at times, \nappeared only \nover the left side. These findings are indicative of subcortical \n\ndysfunction in these regions. There are five pushbutton \nactivations, \nnone of which shows any evidence of electrographic seizures. On \nvideo, \non two occasions, the patient is able to speak to state that she \ncannot \nstop the symptoms. During other events, she has waxing and \nwaning \nflexion extension of the trunk, pelvic thrusting, shaking of the \nright \narm, head rocking back-and-forth, and neck and back \nhyperextension. \nThese events are consistent with non-epileptic seizures. Note is \nmade \nof sinus tachycardia during pushbutton events. \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ Reason for Admission: ___ with h\/o chronic pericarditis, \nanxiety disorder, no prior seizure history, presents now with \n___ chest pain and concern for new seizure.\n.\nActive Problems:\n.\n# Pseudoseizure: Initial concern was for epileptic seizure and \nNeurology was consulted in the ED. MRI and EEG were performed \n(see results\/reports) and no evidence of epileptiform seizure \nwas found. MRI did show nonspecific left frontal periventricular \nhyperintensity without enhancement, but the neurology service \ndid not feel this could represent a cause of her symptoms. \nThought was given to LP for possible demyelenating disease, but \ngiven the absence of focal neuro deficits separated in time and \nspace, MRI finding was felt to be incidental and not indicative \nof an underlying demyelinating disease. There was no fever, \nleukocytosis or meningeal signs to suggest an infectious cause \nfor her symptoms. Given her known anxiety disorder, histrionic \nbehavior and negative workup, Psychiatry was consulted. Psych \nfelt the patient may have an undertreated anxiety disorder and \nfelt that in the absence of medical causes for her symptoms, \nconversion disorder vs somatization disorder were possible \ncauses for her presentation. The patient's anxiety medications \nwere increased (added Klonopin) and she seemed somewhat less \nanxious. Ultimately, Ms ___ was diagnosed with \npseudoseizure and no medical cause for her presentation was \nfound. She was encouraged to follow up with her PCP and to \ncontinue her outpatient psychiatric care. \n.\n# Chest Pain: The patient reported ___ chest pain, which is a \nchronic problem for her. She had previously been diagnosed with \npericarditis, initially at ___, and is followed by Dr. ___ at \n___ for her diagnosis of chronic pericarditis. On this \nadmission, she stated her pain was exactly the same as the pain \nshe has experienced with prior flares of her chronic \n\"pericarditis.\" She has had an extensive cardiac workup \nincluding repeated TTEs, multiple cardiac MRIs and a full \nrheumatologic workup without any evidence of pericarditis or \nconnective tissue disorder. Troponins and CKBM were negative, \nand the suspicion for ACS was very low in this otherwise low \nrisk young woman. On prior admissions, her chest pain has not \nresponded to Toradol, NSAIDs or Colchicine. She does endorse a \nsmall amount of relief with a Fentanyl Patch and narcotic pain \nmediacations. Given she has had an extensive workup for her pain \non multiple prior admissions, we did not pursue further \ndiagnostic testing for her chest pain. She was given Oxycodone, \na Fentanyl patch and benzodiazepines for her pain.  \n.\nChronic Problems:\n.\n# Eosinophilic Esophagitis\/Gastritis: Pt has no objective  \nevidence of this on most recent GI biopsy. At this time, it does \nnot appear that she meets the diagnostic criteria for \neosinophillic esophagitis. \n.\n# Anxiety\/Insomnia: Patient has significant anxiety, which is \nlikely a major contributing factor to her symptoms. She was \ncontinued on her home Ambien and Ativan and also given Klonopin. \nOn the day of discharge, she was also given 5mg of Zydis, which \nseemed to help with her severe anxiety. \n.\nTransitional Issues: Prior to discharge, I talked to her \noutpatient pain physician and informed him of her \nhosptialization. He asked that I given her enough Fentanyl \npatches to last 2 weeks, at which time she could again be seen \nin pain clinic. Otherwise, he asked that I not provide \nadditional narcot pain medications. She will follow up with \nAllergy\/Immunology and Psychiatry as well as her PCP and pain \nmanagement doctor.   \n \nMedications on Admission:\nlorazepam 1 mg Tab BID prn anxiety and nausea  \nzolpidem 20 mg at bedtime, as needed for insomnia  \nsumatriptan 50 mg prn headache  \nfentanyl 12 mcg\/hr Transderm Patch Transdermal  \nNucynta (tapentadol) 50 mg ___ tabs q6h prn pain  \nZofran 4 mg po q8h prn nausea  \nFluticasone 50 mcg 2 sprays BID  \nomeprazole 20 mg po BID  \nDocusate 100 mg po BID  \nSenna 1 tab po BID  \nColchicine 0.6 mg po BID  \nMultivitamin daily  \n \nDischarge Medications:\n1. fentanyl 12 mcg\/hr Patch 72 hr Sig: One (1)  Transdermal \nevery ___ (72) hours for 10 days.\nDisp:*5 * Refills:*0*\n2. lorazepam 1 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO twice a day as \nneeded for anxiety.  \n3. zolpidem 5 mg Tablet Sig: Four (4) Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) \nfor 2 days.\nDisp:*8 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*\n4. sumatriptan succinate 50 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO \nonce a day as needed for headache.  \n5.

For details regarding the stroke history, please see\ndetailed notes in ___ from ___ initail presentation and\nevaluation by our ___ vascular Neurology team, as well as Dr.\n___ clinic ___ notes, in ___ and\n___ of this year.\n\nThe history of today's episode is a bit fragmented, with a bit \nof\ninformation from the patient (somnolent s\/p Ativan in ED) from\nher daughter (who was at work until arrival in ED just now) and\nfrom ED physicians' reports. It seems that the patient was in \nher\nUSOH, at home, when around 4pm she developed \"twitching in my\nhand.\" The twitching spread -- within minutes, per pt. -- to\ninvolve the whole arm and then the leg. She cannot recall \nwhether\nher face was twitching. She activated EMS, who had to break down\nher door. She continued having Left arm and leg rhythmic jerking\nmovements on arrival to our ED, where she was reoprtedly lucid\nwith normal speech and language and A&Ox3 (per ED resident). The\nrhythmic jerking movements of her Left foot\/ankle were recorded\non a brief iphone video, which I reviewed. She was given 1mg IV\nlorazepam, which reduced the jerking movements somewhat, and \nthen\nan additional 1mg IV lorazepam, at which point the movements\nstopped. A ___ was ordered. We were consulted to evaluate the\npatient for seizure. I asked the ED physicians to hold off on\nfurther medications or tests until I evaluated her.\n\nShe says she has never seized and never experienced any episodes\nlike this. She denies recent illness.

We obtained a brain MRI in order to make sure ___ do not have a new stroke, and the MRI did not show any acute changes from your last MRI. We have made some changes to your blood pressure meds because your heart rate has been low, and therefore we cut the amlodipine in half (from 5 to 2.5mg), and stopped your metoprolol. We have also decreased your lisinopril to 30mg daily instead of 40mg as your blood pressure was also low. We started ___ on an antibiotic because ___ had a urinary tract infection.

Retained stone was ruled \nout given normal LFTs and normal MRCP.  SMA syndrome was under \nconsideration since the patient had lost weight over the past \ncouple months and endorsed post-feeding pain.  However, CT scan \nand MRCP findings were not consistent with this diagnosis.  \nCeliac sprue was also entertained given nausea, vomiting, and \nweight loss with abdominal pain but TTG-Ab were negative.  ___ \n___ syndrome was also considered in etiology for RUQ and \npelvic exam was done that showed no cervical motion tenderness; \nGC and chlamydia were negative.  Ultimately it was thought that \nher right upper quadrant pain was likely secondary to muscle \nstrain in the setting of repeated vomiting; the vomiting was \nthought to be due to uncontrolled gastoparesis as well as a \ncomponent of anxiety.  Was given Ibuprofen with some resolution \nof her pain.  To continue treatment of her gastroparesis, she \nwas advised to eat smaller meals, avoid fatty foods, and \nmaintain good control of her sugars.  She was also given a small \nsupply of Ativan to help reduce anxiety.  She was scheduled for \noutpatient GI follow-up on the same day as discharge, for \nfurther management of her gastroparesis.\n\n# Type I diabetes mellitus, well-controlled, with complications: \nFollowed at ___.

We did a test called MRCP and found that you had no abnormalities in your bile system. We also did a CT scan and did not find any abnormalities. The most likely cause for your right upper quadrant pain is likely muscle strain from repeated episodes of vomiting, since changes in position seemed to bring this pain on. Your vomiting is likely because of your gastroparesis. To improve gastroparesis, you should try to eat small meals. Large volumes of fluid or food can cause vomiting because of gastroparesis. Other things that you can do include avoiding fats (this can slow your stomach down) and keeping your sugars under control (high sugars also slow your stomach down). Please talk to your gastroenterologist about further assistance with your diet. Your sugars were low in the mornings while you were in the hospital. Part of the reason your sugar was low was likely because you were eating less."}

There is mild symmetric left \nventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and \nregional\/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal \ntechnical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be \nfully excluded. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated \nwith mild global free wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal \nsystolic septal motion\/position consistent with right \nventricular pressure overload. The aortic root is mildly dilated \nat the sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The \naortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic \nstenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The \nmitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. An eccentric, \nposteriorly directed jet of mild to moderate (___) mitral \nregurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is \nseen.

Mildly dilated right \nventricle with mild global right ventricular hypokinesis in the \nsetting of moderate pulmonary hypertension. Normal left \nventricular regional\/global systolic function. Mild to moderate \nmitral regurgitation. Moderate tricuspid regurgitation.\nCompared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, \nthe degree of mitral regurgitation seems to have worsened \nhowever may be due to slightly better image quality on the \ncurrent study.\n\nMR ___ ___:\nNo evidence for acute ischemia.  Mild volume loss with \nprominence of ventricles and sulci. \n\nColonoscopy ___:\nThe ileocolonic anastamosis looked healthy and normal (expected \n3 weeks post-op appearance). There was very mild ulceration at \nthe suture line, but no evidence of bleeding or stigmata. There \nwas dark\/melenic liquid issuing from the ileum. The ileum could \nnot be entered deeply with the scope because of angulation.\nDiverticulosis of the colon\nPolyp in the descending colon (biopsy) --> adenoma \n\nTagged RBC scan ___ and ___:\nNo active bleeding. \n\n___ PICC line placement:\n1.  Occlusive right basilic and axillary thrombus.  Patent right \nbrachial and \ncephalic veins. \n  \n2.  Partially occlusive right internal jugular thrombus. \n  \n3.  Widely patent left internal jugular vein. \n  \nIMPRESSION:  Unsuccessful placement of a PICC via the right \ncephalic vein.  The patient has no suitable option for a PICC in \nthe right or left arm.  A tunneled central catheter could be \nplaced for long-term access via the left IJ, but the right IJ \ndemonstrates partially occlusive thrombus.  \n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n====================================\nPRIMARY REASON FOR HOSPITALIZATION\n====================================\nMr. ___ is a ___ with DMII, CKD, HTN, afib on coumadin \nrecently admitted to ___ for AKF and discharged to ___ \nrehab on ___ now readmitted to the ICU on ___ for GI bleed. He \nunderwent ___ embolization of right sided colonic angiodysplasia \non ___ and then was then found to have ischemic colitis on \nsigmoidoscopy on ___. He underwent right hemicolectomy on ___. \nHe continued to have melena in the MICU and after transfer to \nthe floor, with multiple workups to localize the bleeding, which \ndid not show definitive results. His GIB gradually slowed down \nand stopped  ___, and his hct remained stable over a course \nof several days. He no longer required blood transfusions at the \ntime of discharge, and he was no longer producing melanotic \nstools. He was discharged to a long term acute care facility and \nwill have further followup with GI, surgery, and ENT, Renal. \n\n==============\nACTIVE ISSUES\n==============\n# GI Bleed:\nPatient at rehab with brbpr, dizziness and tachycardia.  Upon \narrival to the ED H\/H 6.4\/20.7 down from 8.3\/26.9 on the day \nprior.  He received 7 units of pRBCs, 1 unit of FFP and INR was \nreversed with K centra.  GI was consulted and requested a CTA \nabd\/pelvis, which did not localize the bleed. Flex sig was \nperformed in the MICU and revealed mucosal ulceration consistent \nwith ischemic injury thought secondary to hypotension in the \nsetting of his recent shock.  He continued to have extensive \nbloody\/melanotic stools requiring frequent transfusions and \nhypotension requiring pressor support.  On ___ he went for an \n___ guided angiography which showed right sided colonic \nangiodysplasia which was successfully embolized.  He required \nintermittent blood transfusions over the next few days to keep \nhis HGB >7, GI following.  GI performed bedside sigmoidoscopy \nagain on ___ which showed ischemic colitis. On the evening of \n___ he began to once again have large-volume melena, was \ntransferred back to MICU for management. He was taken to the OR \n___ for R colectomy for ischemic colitis. Was given 5U \nPRBCs, 3U FFP in OR. Post-op continued to have melanotic bowel \nmovements requiring intermittent transfusions. EGD was performed \n___ and was negative, colonoscopy was planned but aborted as Hct \nthen became stable. On ___ the patient was transferred back to \nthe MICU service for persistent GI bleeding, hypotension and \n___. Patient was intermittantly hypotensive that was responsive \nto fluids, but was overall hemodynamically stable. Over his MICU \ncourse he he was given a total of 7 units PRBCs as his H\/H were \ncontinuosly down trending. H\/H stabilized and patient was \nsubsequently called out to the floor. After transfer to the \nfloor, he underwent colonoscopy on ___, which showed no acute \nbleeding from the colon and was notable for an adenomatous polyp \nrequiring outpatient followup and polypectomy. He also underwent \ntagged RBC scans x2 which did not show active bleeding. He \nstarted a capsule study which did not show definitive results \nbecause the capsule remained in his stomach. Toward the latter \npart of the week on ___, his GIB had gradually slowed down, and \nby ___, he had stopped having melenic stools. His hct remained \nstable at 25.6 on the day of discharge. He will followup with GI \nafter discharge. Given his long course of GI bleeding of unknown \nsource, his warfarin was held during his hospitalization and \nwill continue to be held on discharge to rehab. Both the patient \nand his family understand the risks of the GI bleeding \noutweighing the benefits and have agreed to hold warfarin for \nnow. He was started on 81 mg aspirin on ___. \n\n# Confusion\/Delirium\nPatient initially had nighttime delirium in the MICU.  Patient \nwas maintained on Seroguel 200mg qHS, tapered down to 100mg over \nseveral weeks.  Attempted to minimize disturbances and encourage \nappropriate day\/night cycle. Continued to have altered mental \nstatus post-op, in the setting of increasing BUN, possibly due \nto uremia, although dialysis with a lower BUN did not improve \nhis mental status. Was following commands intermittently, and \nmore consistently after extubation #2. After transfer to the \nfloor, patient required Seroquel infrequently and his confusion \nhad resolved on the day of discharge. \n\n# Afib\nUpon admission, his INR was reversed and his home meds of \ncoumadin, metop, dig and dilt were all held. Rate control agents \nwere restarted with dose adjusted to maintain SBP 100-110 and HR \n100-110. Cardiology consulted for aid in management.  They \nconcluded rhythm control would not be helpful given prior failed \nattempts.  Will need further discussions to discuss restarting \ncoumadin (currently being held). Post-op he continued to have \nafib with HR in the 100s, controlled initially on a dilt gtt and \ndigoxin. POD 4 had increasing HR to 130s -> changed to amio gtt \nfrom dilt gtt then transitioned to PO amio with adequate rate \ncontrol prior to discharge.\n\n# Nutrition\nDobhoff was placed and the patient received tube feeds while PO \nintake was poor.  The tube came out and was not replaced given \nrespiratory distress and the need for face mask ventilation.  \nPICC placed and TPN started and continued until ___.  FEES ___ \nshowed still not safe for thin liquids, although may do short \ntrials. Failed speech and swallow again ___. TFs started \n___, then restarted again ___. He pulled out his NG tube on \n___ and refused NGT replacement. He was evaluated by speech and \nswallow via fiberoptic swallow study and placed on a \nhoneythickened liquid and pureed solid diet. He tolerated this \ndiet well. \n\n# Respiratory distress: Likely due to mucous plugging given \ninability to cough up secretions, acute onset of episodes of \ndistress, and improvement with deep suctioning. LLL collpse \npersists in the wake of VAP.  Aspiration another likely \ncontributor. s\/p treatment for VAP\/Pseudomonas with cefepime \n(___).  Treated with saline nebs, pulmonary toilet, \nhumidified oxygen, chest ___ for secretions, and guaifenesin as \nmucolytic. Was exubated ___ -> then failed and reintubated ___ \nfor worsening mental status. Was reextubated ___. After transfer \nto the floor, his secretions were cleared with suctioning. \n\n# Hoarse voice and vocal cord dysfunction:  Since extubation, \nthe patient has had hoarse voice.  Per ENT, L vocal cord \nparalysis and mild loss of sensation.  While this is likely \nage-related change combined with ETT injury, they do note that \nit could be neurologic deficit.  If there is persistent \nrecurrent laryngeal nerve injury, he would be a candidate for \npossible vocal cord medialization as an outpatient.  His vocal \ncord dysfunction is contributing to his respiratory distress, as \nhe has poor cough and ability to protect his airway.  High \naspiration risk.  Voice now stronger, cough still impaired.  \nGiven possible tongue deviation and persistent difficulty \nswallowing, as well as FEES findings of persistent vocal cord \ndysfunction, performed MRI which did not show ischemia. Treated \nwith high-dose reflux therapy, aggressive humidification with \nshovel mask and Q2-4 hr saline nebs, even if patient has no O2 \nrequirement. \n\n# AoCKD:  Significantly worsening ___ ___.  FeNa 0.43%, \nrenal u\/s ruled out R-sided hydro (L side not examined), Foley \ndraining well. Held diuresis despite slight volume overload on \nexam.  Of note, patient required CRRT for oliguric renal failure \nduring last admission.  Concern for poor forward perfusion \ncausing ATN, although etiology of hypotension or AF with RVR is \ndebatable.  ___ d\/c tamsulosin and reduced Seroquel and \nmetoprolol doses to maintain SBP > 100.  per Cardiology, prefer \nno midodrine, maintain SBP 100 by reducing rate control \nmedications if necessary and using pRBCs for hydration. CVVH \npost-op until ___, followed by intermittent lasix, converting \nfrom anuric to nonoliguric renal failure. Then HD ___, started \nautodiuresing thereafter and no longer required HD. After \ntransfer to the floor, his creatinine continued to trend down to \n1.6 on the day of discharge. \n\n# LUE DVT:  Noticed ___ ___ swelling of LUE, where PICC is \nplaced. DVT Confirmed by u\/s. Per Renal, no immediate plans for \nHD thus can switch to R arm.  Resited PICC ___. New US ___ \nshowed L axillary, subclavian, 1 of 2 brachial veins, and new \ncephalic vein DVT LUE. As GI bleed continued, no anticoagulation \nwas started.\n\n==========================\nRESOLVED ISSUES IN MICU\n========================== \n# VAP:  Concern for VAP given leukocytosis and fevers during \nintubation. Sputum growing Pseudomonas. Completed 2-week course \ncefepime ___ with resolution of leukocytosis and fever.\n\n# BPH:  Currently with Foley for urinary retention.  Unable to \ntake tamsulosin via NGT, therefore voiding trial deferred \npending ability to swallow pills. d\/c tamsulosin.\n\n# Unresponsive episode\nPatient with unresponsive episode on ___.  It is unclear \nwhat happened but he has since resolved. Ddx includes seizure \nvs. stroke vs. hypoactive delirium.  Per neurology, 20 minute \nEEG shows no seizures.  Ultimately, neurology felt this was \nlikely a hypoactive delirious episode. \n\n# Respiratory distress\nIn the ED, patient felt to be clinically volume overloaded, as \nhe was unable to lay flat.  Given the need for massive \ntransfusion of blood products, he was intubated and sedated.  On \n___, he was successfully extubated.\n\n# CKD\nPatient recently admitted for ___ (thought to be pre-renal in \nnature) improved to 1.6 upon day of discharge.  Now returns with \nCr at 1.4- seems to be at baseline.\nOn day of admission, he underwent CTA and then underwent ___ \nangiography on ___.  Cr initially was elevated in the setting \nof likely pre-renal due to GI bleed but downtrended with fluid \nrescusitation.\n\n# Diarrhea\nPatient with severe diarrhea on prior admission, felt to be \nmainly due to nutritional status.  Was discharged on loperamide. \n Loperamide was held upon admission given his brbpr\/melanotic \nstools. C. diff negative ___. \n\n# Troponin Elevation \nOn recent admission, patient with mild troponin elevation to .04 \nin the setting of ___.  Now admitted with troponin elevatinon to \n.09 in the setting of GI bleed.  EKG in the ED showed afib with \nnew ST depressions in V2-V4 and slightly worsening ST \ndepressions in V4-V6 from prior.  Taken together, his troponemia \nlikely represents demand ischemia in the setting of hypotension \non top of known CKD. \n\n===============\nCHRONIC ISSUES\n===============\n# BPH: initially held tamsulosin as foley wasin place, then \nrestrated\n# DMII: holding held metformin, on ISS\n# HLD: held simvastatin initially then restarted\n# Gout: initially held home allopurinol\n\n===================\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES\n===================\n-discussion about restarting anticoagulation when he follows up \nwith GI (he has DVTs in his arms, non occlusive, and Afib RVR \nCHADS=2), anticoag has been held in setting of GIB and when \nstable discussion can be made about restarting those agents\n- Patient has scheduled followup with GI, surgery, and ENT and \nrenal\n- 7 mm right middle lobe lung nodule.

You underwent a resection of part of the large intestine (colon) to stop the bleeding, and you stayed in the intensive care unit for a while before being transferred to the general medical floor. You underwent a colonoscopy, tagged red blood scan, and capsule study to find the source of the bleeding but the results did not reveal any definitive location of bleeding. Your gastrointestinal bleeding slowed down and stopped gradully. Your blood counts were monitored daily and remained stable without further need for blood transfusions. The gastroenterologists do recommend that you repeat the capsule study at some time in the future for further evaluation of your intestinal tract.

You were found to have pneumonia. Your pneumonia was treated with an antibiotic called levofloxacin. You had some lab tests called a blood cultures to check for bacteria. One of the blood cultures grew a type of bacteria called coagulase-negative staphylococcus. Due to this, you were briefly treated with an antibiotic called vancomycin. The infectious disease service was consulted and felt that the bacteria in the blood culture bottle was likely a contaminant rather than a true blood infection. Nonetheless, because you have an ICD, it is important to be certain that there is no blood infection.

He was \nadmitted with acute hypercarbic respiratory failure with pCO2 73 \n(VBG) on admission.  He required BiPAP in the ICU temprorarily - \nwith improvement after treatment with antibiotics and steroids \nand nebulizers.  The possible triggers would include pneumonia \nas well as medication non-compliance as ran out of inhalers \nseveral days PTA. \n   There was likely pneumonia given leukocytosis, increased \nsputum production, and question of bilateral infiltrates on CXR. \n Because he had no recent hospitalizations, he was initially \ntreated as if her had community acquired pneumonia with \nceftriaxone, azithromycin.  He was also given prednisone, \nduonebs standing, albuterol nebs PRN, and Advair.  Ultimately he \nwas switched to PO levoflox on ___ for a planned total 8 day \ncourse.\n   Without oxygen, he desaturated to 80% particularly with \nexertion.  He was intstructed to have oxygen on at all time \ngiven this consideration.  The family also reported that he did \nmuch better with nebulizers (and did not work with inhalers well \nat home).  For this reason, he was placed on Oxygen, given \nprescription for nebulizers.  He can restart Tiotropium at \ndischarge\n\n# Tachycardia: irreg\/irreg: during this admission, Mr. ___ had \nepisodes of significant tachycardia - with heart rates as high \nast 170s with exertion.  EKG revealed afib (vs. MAT).  There was \nno hypotension during these events.  His oxygenation was \noptimized and he was placed on escalating dose of diltiazem.  \nUltimately, he was placed on 360 mg\/day of diltiazem with good \nresponse.  His HR was largely ___ at rest, although would \nincrease to 150 with exertion. The tachycardia was likely \ncontributed by nebs and possible compouned by recent infection.  \n The hope is that the afib is transient in the acute setting and \nthat long-term anticoagulation can be avoided altogether (also \nfall risk). \n\n# BPH: Mr. ___ had an episode of urinary retention with BS \n650cc.  This was possibly compounded by constipation.  He was \nplaced on flomax, in addition to the finateride.  he was also \ntreated for his constipation.  With this, regimen, he had  good \nurine output with PVR in low 100 range.

IMPRESSION:   Nonobstructive bowel gas pattern.   \n\n___   Imaging CHEST (PA & LAT) \nNew left lower lobe infiltrate and effusion.\n\n___   Imaging CTA ABD & PELVIS \nCT ABDOMEN:  A 5 mm hypodensity is visualized in hepatic segment \nVIII, which is too small to fully characterize by CT but likely \nrepresents a biliary hamartoma or cyst.  A region of peripheral \nwedge-shaped hyperattenuation in hepatic segment VIII does not \npersist into the delayed phases and is likely perfusion anomaly. \n The liver otherwise enhances homogeneously without worrisome \nfocal lesion or intra- or extra-hepatic biliary duct \ndilatations.  The gallbladder is thin-walled and unremarkable.  \nThe spleen and adrenal glands are unremarkable in appearance.  \nThe pancreas is significantly atrophied but otherwise \nunremarkable.  Bilateral native kidneys are again severely \natrophied with dense vascular calcifications within.   The \nstomach, duodenum and small bowel are unremarkable in appearance \nwithout focal wall thickening or evidence of obstruction.  The \nlarge bowel has a moderate amount of fecal load, but is \notherwise unremarkable.  Both, small and large bowel wall \nenhances homogeneously without evidence of ischemia.  An \nenteroenteric anastomosis is seen in the left hemiabdomen \nwithout evidence of obstruction at this point.   The abdominal \naorta is of normal caliber with prominent dense mural \natherosclerotic calcifications along its entire length and \nextending to all branch vasculature.  Despite significant \nvascular calcifications, on post-contrast images there does not \nappear to be significant flow-limiting stenosis, with preserved \ndistal opacification and blood flow.  There is no mesenteric or \nretroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.  There is no ascites, \npneumoperitoneum or frank herniation.   CT PELVIS:  A \ntransplanted kidney is noted in the right lower quadrant, which \nenhances homogeneously without focal lesion or hydronephrosis.  \nTransplanted pancreas is noted in the upper pelvis and enhances \nhomogeneously without focal lesion or ductal dilatation.  A \nperitoneal dialysis catheter inserts in the left lower quadrant \nabdominal wall with the tip extending and ending within the \nlower pelvis.  The bladder and rectum are unremarkable in \nappearance.  The uterus is surgically absent.  There is a 3.7 x \n2.9 cm cystic structure in the right adnexa.  There is no free \npelvic fluid or air.  There is no inguinal or pelvic wall \nlymphadenopathy by CT size criteria.   OSSEOUS STRUCTURES:  \nThere is no focal blastic or lytic lesions in the visualized \nosseous structures concerning for malignancy.   IMPRESSION: 1.  \nDense atherosclerotic calcification of the abdominal aorta and \nbranch vasculature which remain patent on post-contrast phases.  \nNo flow-limiting stenosis. 2.  No evidence of enteric pathology, \nwithout evidence of bowel ischemia. 3.  Right adnexal cystic \nlesion which should be further evaluated by ultrasound. 4.  \nRight greater than left pleural effusion. 5.  Prominently \natrophied native kidneys.

Pain mostly \nnocturnal and during day today after HD. Etiology remains \nunclear. Pt without pain on admission after morphine in the ED. \nDDx includes constipation, ischemia after HD, transplant \nrejection. No signs currently of PD line infection. Repeat \nperitoneal dialysate cell count showed 31 WBCs, 905 RBCs, 10 \nPMNs, cultures negative. CMV viral load not detectable. Pt was \nseen by GI service, who felt that Pt may have some element of \nischemia when hypotensive given extensive calcifications. GI \nrecommended increased bowel regimen, metoclopromide for nausea \/ \nvomiting, and outpatient EGD if Pt remains symptomatic to r\/o \ngastritis \/ PUD. Peritoneal cultures negative. Pt was also seen \nby pain service, who made several recommendations (see below). \nPt continued to have abdominal discomfort, though not pain with \nmorphine PR and acquiesed to CTA abdomen to definitively examine \nmesenteric ischemia. CTA abdomen did not actually show any \ndefinitive evidence of mesenteric ischemia. Specifically, \nradiology felt pt had \"dense atherosclerotic calcification of \nthe abdominal aorta and branch vasculature which remain patent \non post-contrast phases.  No flow-limiting stenosis. No evidence \nof enteric pathology, without evidence of bowel ischemia.\" Pt \ndid have significant fecal loading on CT, which was also seen on \nnon-contrast CT abdomen when she was previously admitted for \nsimilar symptoms. Taken together, her abdominal pain is most \nlikely due to chronic constipation. Pt was confused regarding \nher symptoms of diarrhea, and it was explained to her that \nsometimes patients suffer from liquid loose bowel movements when \nthey are actually constipated. She was discharged on an \naggressive bowel regimen and Pt was instructed to use tap water \nenemas if she is not having at least one large bowel movement \nevery day.\n\n# pain control regimen: Pt is very belligerent and states \nrepeated that she \"cannot take any oral pain medication.\" She \ninsists that she can only take IV medications, mainly IV \nmorphine and states that her other doctors told ___ that she \nshould \"go to the ER\" whenever she has pain for pain \nmedications. She completely refuses to try any oral pain \nmedications, stating that it will make her nauseated. She has \nalso refused acetaminophen, which she reports taking at home for \npain. She is upset that her morphine is diluted in 50mL NS and \nrun over 15 minutes rather than given as IV push. Pain seems to \nbe better by ___, but then worse again ___. Pt remained \nvery belligerent and abusive toward staff. Pt was seen by \nchronic pain service, who recommended trial of tapentadol (a \ncombination SSRI \/ opiate) at 50mg po tid prn pain. This \nmedication is expected to have fewer nausea \/ vomiting \nside-effects than pure opiate, but this med is not available in \nhospital. Also recommended to take methadome 2.5mg po bid but Pt \nreported excessive drowsiness. Her methadone was therefore \nstopped, but kept morphine suppositories ___ PR q6 hrs PRN. \nDiscussed with her local ___ pharmacy in ___, who said \nthat they would definitely be able to supply. She was discharged \non this medication in addition to her gabapentin 100mg po daily. \nAdditionally, the cause of her abdominal pain is likely to be \nworsening constipation as explained above, and she was \ndischarged on a strong bowel regimen and instructions to use tap \nwater enemas as needed to have a bowel movement daily. In the \nfuture, she should be preferentially given morphine 5mg PR if \nshe is having similar pain and avoid IV morphine.\n\n# Supratherapeutic INR: INR of 6.7 in the ED s\/p 2.5mg PO \nvitamin K. No clear indication for reversal but now will have to \nmonitor closely for subtherapeutic INR given mechanical valve. \nINR initially down to 4.3 on ___, then back up to INR 6.1 on \n___, INR 7.5 on ___, most likely due to levofloxacin \nadministration. INR corrected to 3.2 on ___, Pt was dosed \nwith 1mg warfarin, but INR down to 2.0 on ___, dosed 2.5mg \nwarfarin and increased to 2.1 on ___. Dosed w\/ 4mg warfarin \nand INR increased to 3.7. Pt was discharged on 2mg po warfarin \nfor the next two days w\/ INR checks every ___, \n___ as previously and managed per ___ clinic.\n \n# Low grade temp: Tmax 99.6 at home. Not a true fever and no \nclear infectious source other than whole body pain. This could \nbe representative of a viral illness with myalgias. Pt currently \nwithout pain so difficult to assess. Pt with abdominal pain that \nhas been worked up. No signs of infection around HD line and PD \nline per surgery assessment. Pt finished course of Cephalexin \nyesterday for empiric treatment of possible superficial skin \ninfection around PD catheter. Repeat CMV viral load \nundetectable. Chest XR w\/ new LLL infiltrate in comparison to \nCXR from last week. Pt completed course of azithromycin for \npossible pneumonia.\n\n# possible pneumonia: Pt with good O2 sat but new LLL infiltrate \non chest XR relative to prior XR from 1 week ago. Pt reports \nhaving a chronic mild cough since ___ after her ICD \nplacement. She has no leukocytosis or fever. However, Pt is \nreporting some non-specific malaise. Although this would \ntechnically be considered a hospital-acquired pneumonia, given \nher absence of symptoms, Pt was initially treated w\/ \nlevofloxacin, but switched to azithromycin on ___ due to \ninteraction w\/ warfarin. She completed a 5 day course without \nissue. \n\n# Pleural effusions: Pt was incidentally found to have pleural \neffusions R > L on her CT abdomen. This also noted on chest XR \npreviously but seems to small to moderate based on CT scan. Pt \nwas completely asymptomatic and per patient preference, we \ndeferred diagnostic thoracentesis, but instructed Pt to have a \nfollow-up chest XR in ___ weeks. If the effusion increases in \nsize or does not resolve, we suggested that the patient have \ndiagnostic thoracentesis to rule out exudative process.\n\n# Adnexal mass: Pt was incidentally found to have R adnexal \ncystic lesion ~ 3 x 4 cm, which was previously noted on a \nnon-contrast CT. Pt states that she has known about this lesions \nfor many years, ever since her hysterectomy. She reports that \nshe was told by her gynecologist that it was benign and that she \ncould have it removed if it ever became bothersome. Its size \nappears to have remained unchanged over several years based on \nher description. Pt deferred further workup for now, stating \nthat she preferred to speak with her gynecologist.

You may have a mild pneumonia (infection of your lung). You were treated with antibiotics. We had the gastroenterology and pain services see you for your abdominal pain, and made recommendations. Your pain was well-controlled with rectal morphine suppositories, and you did not experience any nausea or vomiting with this medication, which you previously experience with oral opiate pain killers. Your abdominal pain was most likely caused by constipation. Your CT scan with contrast did not show convincing evidence of mesenteric ischemia. We therefore recommend a strong daily bowel regimen (Miralax ___ packets daily, two tabs of senna twice daily) and tap water enemas as needed to have regular bowel movements. Your INR, a measure of your blood clotting, was initially elevated, and then too low. We gave you appropriate medications to get your INR in the goal range of 3.0-3.5. You should take your warfarin at 2mg daily for the next two days and then have your INR checked on ___ as you previously were. The ___ clinic will be in touch with you regarding your dosing."}

Psych was consulted. Suspect that this \nrepresents delirium in the setting of UTI. Could also consider \nuntreated depression given subacute anhedonia and lack of \nactivity per discussion with family. Pt's level of agitation \nwaxed and waned throughout course, further supporting diagnosis \nof delirium. MRI showed mild thickening and enhancement of the \nmid to posterior aspect of the falx. Neurology evaluated her and \nfelt that this was likely incidental finding and did not warrant \nany further inpatient workup. Per psychiatry recommendations, \nshe was started on ramelteon and Seroquel for sleep. Her \noxybutynin was held given concern that this could be \ncontributing to her mental status changes as well. She refused \nSeroquel on most nights. Of note, she was continued on her \npregabalin, ranitidine, and paroxetine; however, could consider \nthese as possible causes of AMS if she continues to have issues. \nOver the course of her hospitalization, her mental status \ngradually improved. She was seen by OT who recommended rehab.  \nShe was seen by Neurology who felt her presentation was most \nconsistent with delirium and advised outpatient follow-up in \n___ clinic with additional brain imaging as below.\n.\n# MRI brain showing: \"Mild thickening and enhancement of the mid \nto posterior aspect of the falx\"\n- Neurology evaluated her and ultimately advised outpatient \nNeurology follow-up with repeat MRI brain as outpatient\n- Neuro appointment pending at the time of discharge, but \n___ team working on setting up an appointment.\n.\n# Nephrolithiasis\n# Recurrent UTIs:\nWhile there were no WBCs on UA, given AMS and dtr's report that \npatient had reported some dysuria, opted to treat as UTI. Urine \nculture grew e. coli, sensitive to CTX. She was treated for \ncomplicated UTI for 7 days given significant delirium. Case was \ndiscussed with urology who felt that her remaining stone was \nunlikely to be nidus of infection. After CTX was completed, she \nwas restarted on her ppx Keflex and this was continued on \ndischarge.\n.\n# DOE \/ Cough: Pt reportedly with DOE and cough at home. CXR \nnegative. TTE unremarkable. Pt adamantly denied any respiratory \nsymptoms on the floor. She was continued on her home Advair and \nalbuterol prn, though often refused home Advair, and had no \nrespiratory or exertional complaints while hospitalized. Could \nconsider stress testing and \/ or PFT's as an outpatient if she \nreports DOE at rehab or when she resumes her usual activities at \nhome.\n.\n# DM: Placed on ISS and DM diet. Held home linagliptin as \nnon-formulary and resumed upon discharge to rehab.\n.\n# Urinary incontinence: Held oxybutynin as above in case \ncontributing to mental status decline\/proclivity towards \nconfusion and permanently discontinued this medication upon \ndischarge. Notified patient's daughter (___) of this change in \nmedication by phone and the clinical reasoning behind it and she \nwas in agreement.\n.\n# Neuropathy: Continued home pregabalin.\n.\n# Depression: Continued home paroxetine.\n.\n# GERD: Continued home ranitidine.\n.\n# OSA: Diagnosed on sleep study at BI-P in ___. Did \nnot order CPAP while in house in order to avoid worsening \nagitation (per dtr's report, pt has had paranoid thoughts \ntowards sleep team).\n**Of note, per patient's daughter's report, patient was \ninstructed by her ___ physician NOT to drive based upon \nthe results of the OSA testing in ___, but the patient did \nnot adhere to this recommendation and subsequently refused to \ntake the ___ physician's calls.\n-We have clearly instructed the patient and the patient's \ndaughter (___) that the patient is not to drive until she is \ncleared to do so by her PCP or her ___ specialist.\n.\n.\n.\n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\n===================+\n1) Neuro outpatient follow-up for evaluation of possible early \ndementia, recent AMS, and MRI brain finding of \"Mild thickening \nand enhancement of the mid to posterior aspect of the falx\"\n2) Needs CPAP for OSA treatment\n3) Patient should not drive until cleared to do so by her PCP or \nher ___ specialist.\n4) Plain films of the hip reported abnormal appearance of the \nleft femoral head. While the patient had reportedly mentioned L \ngroin pain prior to admission, she denied any pain here and was \nambulating without issue. This was thought to most likely \nrepresent artifact but can consider dedicated CT of the left hip \nas outpatient if pt reports pain with resuming usual activities \n(i.e. walking). This was discussed with the patient's daughter.\n5) Could consider stress testing and \/ or PFTs as outpatient if \nshe reports exertional dyspnea at rehab or when she resumes her \nusual activities at home.\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

Multiple hyperdense cysts in the kidneys bilaterally, one of \nwhich on the\nleft appears to be complex.  Recommend  ultrasound imaging to \ncharacterize.\n2.  Previously seen fluid collection adjacent to the stomach \npancreas, likely\nrepresenting a pseudocyst, has now resolved.  \n3.  Previously seen fluid collection along the anterior left \nhepatic lobe,\nlikely representing a pseudocyst, has decreased in size.  \n4.  Sigmoid diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.\n\n___ EGD:\n    Esophagitis in the mid and distal esophagus\n    Clean based ulcers in the mid esophagus and GE junction\n    Small hiatal hernia\n    Schatzki's ring\n    Nodule in the distal esophagus with overlying ___ \nesophagus\n    Angioectasias in the stomach body\n    A small opening was seen on the lesser curvature with \nevidence of clean based ulceration at the orifice.

Tiny brightly enhancing vessel coursing alongside the 11 mm \npseudocyst\nadjacent to the pancreatic body at the site of the \npseudocyst-gastric fistula, without evidence of active contrast \nextravasation or pseudoaneurysm formation.\n3. Decreased size of left hepatic subcapsular fluid collection \nand subtly rimenhancing fluid collection along the greater \ncurvature of the stomach\nconsistent with pseudocysts. \n4. Small bilateral non hemorrhagic pleural effusions, increased \nin size. \n5. Increased small volume non-hemorrhagic ascites.\n\n___ NON-CON CT TORSO:\nIMPRESSION: \n1.  Regional inflammatory change involving the pancreas and \nstomach with findings suggestive of a pseudocyst-gastric fistula \nas evidenced by high-density material, probably ingested \ncontrast, within a collection that has decreased in size \ncompared with prior imaging.  Additional collections in the \nanterior abdomen and gastric greater curvature are decreased.  \nWhile gastric ulcer could cause a contained gastric perforation, \nfindings are more suggestive of sequelae of chronic \npancreatitis. \n2.  Multifocal pneumonia likely due to an atypical pathogen, \nbased on the CT appearance. \n3.  Several dilated loops of small bowel in the anterior abdomen \nwith a possible transition point ___ suggest early or partial \nsmall-bowel obstruction.  This should be followed clinically and \nwith serial abdominal radiographs. \n4.  New subcapsular fluid collection in the anterior liver ___ \nrepresent a new pseudocyst related to the patient's pancreatitis \nor a hematoma, which has been partially resorbed and now \ncontains serosanguineous, low density fluid. \n5.  7-mm right upper lobe pulmonary nodule which appears \ndistinct from the pneumonia.  The patient should obtain a chest \nCT after resolution of pneumonia to demonstrate resolution. \n6.  Superior endplate compression fracture of the T11 vertebral \nbody of indeterminate age, but at least as old as ___. \n7.  Additional incidental findings include:  Diverticulosis \nwithout evidence of diverticulitis.  Atherosclerotic disease \nthroughout the large arterial vasculature and coronary artery \ndisease.

Differential considerations include an abscess, \nthough the wall is not as thick and irregular as would be \nexpected for an abscess; anintrapanreatic pseudocyst, though \nunlikely to develop in such a rapid fashion; or an evolving \nhematoma. MRI\/MRCP is suggested for further evaluation.  \n2. A smaller 4-cm complex collection more posteriorly in the \nleft hepatic lobe was likely present on the prior CT and ___ \nreflect a pseudocyst.   \n3. Mild CBD dilation to 9mm, previously normal on ___. \nMRCP is \nrecommended for further assessment.   \n4. Patent hepatic vasculature. \n\nCT Abdomen\/Pelvis ___: Findings overall are not \nsignificantly changed since previous examination of ___. \nExamination shows persistence of a large soft tissue mass \nextending into lesser sac probably originating from the tail of \nthe pancrease with some cystic findings persisting. Whether this \nrepresents evidence of persistence of an inflammatory process or \nwhether this represents evidence of a mass possibly mucinous \nadenocarcinoma of the pancreas is indeterminant on the basis of \nthis examination.  \n\n___ CXR:\nIMPRESSION:\n\n1.  Worsening left lower lobe collapse and\/or consolidation and \nleft mid\/upperzone atelectasis and possible slight worsening of \nopacities in the right upperzone and right base.  Otherwise, I \ndoubt significant interval change in the\nparenchymal findings.\n2.  Marked cardiomediastinal enlargement with a tapered \nappearance to the lower trachea.  The possibility of mediastinal \nlymphadenopathy or other mediastinal pathology cannot be \nexcluded.  Further assessment with CT ___ beuseful to better \ncharacterize this abnormality.\n\nEGD ___\nImpression: Diffuse areas of linear ulceration were found \nthroughout the esophagus, with scattered areas of erythema. \nFindings were suggestive of severe esophagitis. A focal area of \nerythema with overlying exudate was seen in the GE junction. A \nlarge amount of clot was seen taking up much of the lumen in the \nfundus and body. Attempts were made to dislodge the clot \nunsuccessfully. There were evidence of focal erosions within the \nbody with overlying adherent clot. A focal ulcer with large \nvisible vessel was seen in the gastric cardia. The remainder of \nthe gastric mucosa appeared normal. This was thought to be a \npotential source of bleeding. (injection, endoclip)Old blood was \nseen in the duodenum. The underlying mucosa appeared normal. \nOtherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum \n\nDISCHARGE LABS\n___ 05:04AM BLOOD WBC-5.1 RBC-2.46* Hgb-7.8* Hct-24.6* \nMCV-100* MCH-31.8 MCHC-31.9 RDW-17.5* Plt ___\n___ 05:04AM BLOOD Glucose-95 UreaN-43* Creat-1.5* Na-139 \nK-3.4 Cl-108 HCO3-22 AnGap-12\n___ 05:13AM BLOOD ALT-9 AST-18 AlkPhos-89 TotBili-0.2\n___ 05:04AM BLOOD Albumin-3.0* Calcium-8.7 Phos-4.3 Mg-1.9\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nMr. ___ is a ___ man with a history of afib on \ncoumadin and alcohol abuse who presented to OSH with upper GI \nbleed and was transferred to ___ for further management. He \nwas found to have evidence of pancreaticogastric fistula in \nsetting of pancreatic pseudocysts.\n\nACTIVE ISSUES\n\n1. Upper GI bleeding: Underwent EGD on ___, which revealed \nsevere esophagitis and a focal ulcer with large visible vessel \nin the gastric cardia, s\/p endoclip and injection. Bleeding \nstabilized and patient was transferred to floor. He had melenic \nstools initially, likely due to clearing out old blood from his \ninitial bleed. Repeat EGD on ___ showed no evidence of ongoing \nbleeding. Regarding etiology of his bleeding, CT imaging showed \nthat the lesser curvature ulcer was in continuity with a \npancreatic pseudocyst consistent with spontaneous \npancreatico-gastric fistula formation. Pancreatic\/biliary \nsurgery was consulted and recommended NPO\/sips for diet with TPN \nthrough PICC for pancreatic rest and to reduce the risk of food \nobstructing the fistula. Patient was maintained on high-dose PPI \nand TPN and kept off of anticoaulation. He required an \nadditional 1 unit pRBC on ___ for HCT drop. Patient remained \nstable and CTA was repeated on ___ showing resolution of \npseudocyst. Diet was advanced uneventfully and TPN was \ndiscontinued. Patient is scheduled for a repeat EGD as an \noutpatient on ___. He was instructed to hold warfarin until \nafter EGD; pending results, his doctors ___ decide to hold \nwarfarin for a longer period. \n\n2. Pancreatic Mass\/Peudocyst: Spontaneous fistulization with \nlesser curvature of stomach contributing to bleeding ulcer. \nPatient had significant weight loss over the past year (40lbs) \nincluding about 20lbs over last ___ months in setting of \nsignificantly decreased appetite. Consulted with hepatobiliary \nand pancreatic\/biliary surgery team. Regarding the fistula, \npancreaticobiliary recommended no surgical intervention but TPN \nfor pancreatic rest as above. Pseudocyst resolved on repeat \nimaging on ___. \n\n3. Liver cystic lesions: Incidentally noted large hepatic fluid \ncollection (up to 10 cm) that was possibly continuous with \npancreatic pseudocyst. Pancreatic\/Biliary surgery recommended no \nsurgical intervention. Collections improving on ___ CTA. \n\n4. Encephalopathy:  Patient was initially encephalopathic with \nslowed psychomotor responses and confusion. Resolved with his \noverall clinical and metabolic stabilization. \n\n5. Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis: Etiology was most likely due to \nacute renal failure. Derangement was primary metabolic acidosis \nwith respiratory compensation. Lactate normal. Level of BUN\/Cr \ndid not suggest uremia. Serum tox screen was negative for EtOH, \nASA, and acetaminophen. Osmolal gap -8. Glucose not elevated. No \nketones in urine. Resolved. \n\n6. ___: Resolved. Most likely combination of ATN and \ncontrast-induced nephropathy from OSH CT scan, though initial \nFeUrea also suggested a pre-renal component. Granular casts \nappreciated on spun urine ___, further supporting ATN. Given \nthis, not likely fluid-responsive and therefore monitored for \nself-resolution. Did not have any indication for dialysis.\n\n7. Pneumonia: Patient was febrile in ICU with CXR findings \nconcerning for consolidations and ___ CT evidence of multifocal \nupper lobe pneumonia. Given his chronic alcohol use, recent \nmassive GI bleeding, and encephalopathy, patient was covered \nbroadly with both unasyn and levofloxacin. Unasyn served \ndual-purpose of covering this pneumonia along with his \nconcurrent Enterococcal UTI. Levofloxacin covered atypicals and \nPseudomonas. No significant clinical concern for MRSA pneumonia \ngiven multifocality and clinical improvement on his current \nregimen. Continued Unasyn (___) and levofloxacin (___) \nfor 7-day course\n\n8. UTI: Grew enterococcus, 10k-100k, on ___ and culture \nnegative on ___ after treatment initiated. Completed course of \nunasyn as above.\n\n9. Lower extremity edema: EF was preserved on ___ bedside \nECHO. Became markedly overloaded in setting of volume \nresuscitation. Low BP limited aggressive diuresis, and patient's \nregimen was ultimately titrated to furosemide 20 mg PO daily. \n\n10. V-tach: Intermittent, self-limited. Patient was monitored on \ntelemetry and electrolytes were repleted to maintain K>4 and Mg \n>2. His atenolol was uptitrated to 25 mg BID with improvement in \nv-tach. \n\n11. Hypotension\/Secondary Adrenal Insufficiency: Patient was \npersistently and asymptomatically hypotensive. His cortisol stim \ntest suggested mild adrenal insufficiency. He was started on \nfludrocortisone on ___ and ACTH was sent. ACTH ultimately \nreturned in the normal range several hours prior to discharge, \nconsistent with secondary adrenal insufficiency. Fludrocortisone \nis generally not beneficial in secondary adrenal insufficiency; \nhowever, given that patient was clinically stable, without \northostatic hypotension, he was advised to continue \nfludrocortisone until his PCP ___. PCP advised to repeat \ncortisol stim test and consider need for glucocorticoid \nsupplementation (e.g. hydrocortisone) and consider \ndiscontinuation of fludrocortisone (predominantly \nmineralocorticoid). \n\n12. Atrial Fibrillation: CHADS2 score of ___. Patient was \npersistently in a. fib with intermittent RVR. Rate control was \ninitially held in setting of GI bleed. Diltiazem 30mg po QID was \nstarted on ___ and was uptitrated to a total daily dose of 240 \nmg, though patient missed many doses due to hold parameters (low \nBP; please see above). Given ongoing RVR that interferred with \npatient's ability to work with ___, atenolol was restarted and \nuptitrated to 25 mg daily. Given his high risk of re-bleeding \nand recent severe upper GI bleed, risk of bleeding on \nanticoagulation outweighs benefit of small stroke risk \nreduction, so warfarin was held. Patient instructed not to \nrestart warfarin until after his doctors have ___ ___ EGD \nand instructed him that it is safe to do so. \n\nCHRONIC ISSUES\n1. Macrocytic Anemia: Most likely secondary to alcohol use and \nreported history of B12 deficiency. MCV at baseline is 120. MCV \nhas normalized in the setting of receiving pRBC's and \nnutritional support. Continued cyanocobalamin.\n\n2. Alcohol Abuse: Patient has a long history of daily vodka use. \nHe showed no signs of alcohol withdrawal, and CIWA scale was \ndiscontinued on ___.\n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES\n- Repeat labs in 3 days to monitor electrolytes, HCT, and \nthrombocytopenia. Repeat albumin and cortisol stim test to \nconfirm adrenal insufficiency\n- Consider stopping fludrocortisone if no evidence of primary \nadrenal insufficiency (none currently)\n- If CrCl changes, please consider changing atenolol to a \nnon-renally cleared b-blocker such as metoprolol\n- Coumadin is on hold. Please consider restarting after ___ EGD\n- Needs repeat ultrasound of left complex renal cyst in ___ year\n- During admission, patient had a very high gastrin level, which \nwas most likely in the setting of high-dose PPI. Should there be \nany concern for gastrinoma in the future, please d\/c PPI and \nrecheck gastrin level. \n- Lisinopril on hold for low BP\n- Consider need for ongoing pancreatic enzyme replacement\n- Needs follow-up imaging for pulmonary nodule seen on CT\n\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

You underwent an extensive evaluation including physical exams, blood tests, imaging tests, and scoping of your GI tract. Based on these studies, we found that you have a large ulcer in your stomach that was attached to a cyst in your pancreas. You were treated aggressively with units of blood and plasma to improve your blood counts and help reduce bleeding, and the GI doctors also put a clip on the source of bleeding to help it stop. This improved your bleeding and allowed you to stabilize. You received nutrition through your ___ line for several weeks to allow your pancreas to rest. You had a repeat CT scan which no longer showed the abnormal connection between your pancreas and your stomach, and you were restarted on normal food. During your stay, you were also diagnosed with pneumonia and a urinary tract infection. You received a course of antibiotics for both of these and improved. Your kidneys were found to be injured but fortunately after some time improved back to their normal function. During your admission, you were found to have low blood pressures. You had labs suggesting adrenal insufficiency. You were started on a steroid called fludrocortisone while we waited for one of the results to come back. Based on the results we now have available, you most likely have a mild secondary adrenal insufficiency, which can be seen in patients with prolonged illness. Although the fludrocortisone is unlikley helping your condition, we recommend continuing it until you can see your primary care doctor and have your labs repeated."}

Difficult to \nexclude a subtle superimposed process.  \n\n - ___ EKG: normal sinus rhythm  \nPATHOLOGY:\nR LOBE WEDGE RESECTION BX x3 (___):\nA similar process appears to involve all three lung wedge \nresections, though to varying degrees. The dominant finding is \nthat of single and cohesive clusters of pulmonary macrophages \n(many fine pigment laden) filling the alveolar spaces and small \nairways. There is also an associated mild to moderate uniform \ninterstitial fibrosis, though without evidence of architectural \ndistortion or honeycomb change (most severe in part 3). Multiple \nfoci of squamous metaplasia and bronchiolar metaplasia are \nobserved around the small airways, and patchy lymphocytic \naggregates are present. Abundant carbon pigment deposition is \npresent along areas of lymphatic drainage.\n\nThe interstitial fibrosis is relatively uniform in character, \nand no fibroblastic foci are identified. There are no granulomas \nor areas of organizing pneumonia identified. Eosinophils are not \npresent in any\nsignificant numbers. There is no evidence of a vasculitis or \ncapillaritis. Polarizable silicates are scant. There is no \nevidence of an acute infectious process (also see associated \nmicrobiologic culture results, ___ ___ ___, and no \nmalignancy is identified.\n\nIn total, the findings are consistent with desquamative \ninterstitial pneumonia (DIP) \/ respiratory bronchiolitis \ninterstitial lung disease (RB-ILD). There are no findings to \nsuggest a hypersensitivity\npneumonitis. Clinical and radiologic correlation is advised. \nThis case was shown and discussed at ___ Pulmonary \nMedicine-Thoracic Imaging conference on ___ by Dr. ___ \n___.\n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n# Hypoxia: Likely ILD progression. Pt w\/ history f ILD ___ years, \nbiopsy from ___ showing likely desquamative interstitial \npneumonia (DIP) vs. respiratory bronchiolitis interstitial lung \ndisease (RB-ILD). Both pathologies usually resolve with smoking \ncessation though, and the pt endorses quitting Tob ___ years ago. \nUrine cotinine pending. Pt presented to follow up pulmonology \nand PCP ___ ___ with hypoxemia (91% on RA) and \ntachycardic to 136 that was responsive to IVF. TTE + bubble \nstudy (___) were neg for cardiac pathology or shunting. CXR was \nequivocal for pneumonia vs. atelectasis in addition to \nunderlying ILD. CTA revealed no evidence of PE, but was \nconsistent with progression of ILD. There was no overt evidence \nof pneumonia on sputum neg  (___), and pt had baseline \nleukocytosis with Neutrophilic predominance, but is on chronic \nsteroids and received a large pulse in the ED (___). Pulmonology \nwas consulted. Elevated lactate (4.7) and slight worsening of \ncough with minor sputum production gives mild c\/f PJP PNA i\/s\/o \nimmunosuppression (on Azathioprine) and discontinuation of \nBactrim (has not been taking for 3 months prior to \npresentation). BAL was performed ___ (viral Ag labs neg, \nother infectious labs pending). Without any positive infectious \nwork up, clinical progression of sx and imaging was thought to \nbe more representative of interval worsening of his underlying \nILD, and pt was continued on home prednisone, azathioprine. \nRestarted on Bactrim prophylaxis. Pulmonology also started an \nextensive rheumatologic and infectious work up for the ___ \nto follow up with as an outpatient. On d\/c RF, SS-A, SS-B, \nSCL-70, ___ Ab Neg. The ___ could also follow up with \na swallow eval as outpatient as chronic aspiration may be \ncontributing to his hypoxemia given history of choking while \neating. The ___ was discharged on home oxygen after \ndesaturating to SpO2 85% on room air with ambulation, however \nthe pt did not feel significantly short of breath during \nhospitalization, denied chest pain, and denied worsening of his \nbaseline cough. Hypoxemia is mild at rest with SpO2 >94% on 2L.  \nPt was seen by ___ Transplant team ___ and rejected from lung \ntransplant list. F\/u appointment with ___ Transplant team on \n___, 10AM. \n\n# Leukocytosis: likely secondary to chronic prednisone use and \nlarge solumedrol pulse on ___ of 500mg x2, epecially given lack \nof fever or localizing infectious symptoms. \n\n# Steroid-induced hyperglycemia: on metformin 850mg at home, \nthough ___.

Possibilities \nincluded a peripheral vestibulopathy, given the severity of \nsymptoms and rapid resolution, vs. central, such as \nrecrudescence of a chronic cerebellar infarct visualized on head \nCT, or an acute posterior fossa infarct, although this was felt \nless likely given that she had presented with a therapeutic INR. \nUnfortunately, MRI to confirm absence of acute infarct was not \npossible due to her MRI-incompatible pacemaker. CTA head\/neck \nwas negative for vertebrobasilar atherosclerotic disease. She \ndoes have several risk factors including DM (A1c of 6.2), \nhyperlipidemia (LDL 58), and hypertension (initial SBPs in \n130-150s range, which then improved to 110-140s).

Fortunately, your symptoms improved rapidly. The cause of your symptoms is not clear. There are a number of possibilities, including a possible problem with your vestibular system (such as in BPPV), or worsening of your previous stroke. Finally, while unlikely because your INR level was on the high side, it is always possible that you had a new small stroke.

Multiplanar reformats \nincluding maximum-intensity projections were obtained. Three \ndimensional volume-rendered reconstructions were also generated \nfor better evaluation of the vascular anatomy.\n\nCTA OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS: The abdominal aorta, celiac \nartery, superior mesenteric artery, inferior mesenteric artery, \nand their branches are patent without evidence of stenosis or \nembolism or thrombosis. Multiplanar reformats and \nvolume-rendered images also demonstrate no focal areas of \nstenosis or narrowing. Accessory left renal arteries are noted \nincidentally, one supplying the superior and the second \nsupplying the anterior pole of the kidney. The main renal artery \nhas its normal origin from abdominal aorta and enters the hilar \nstructures.\n\nCT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: The liver \ndemonstrates diffusely low attenuation, suggestive of fatty \ninfiltration. However, no focal hepatic lesions or masses are \nidentified. The gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, stomach, \nintra-abdominal bowel loops are unremarkable. There is no \nevidence of ischemic colitis on the current study. The colonic \nwall and the pericolonic mesenteric fat appear unremarkable \nwithout evidence of stranding or edema. No pathologic \nretroperitoneal or mesenteric adenopathy is noted. A low- \nattenuation lesion measuring 17.7 mm x 15 mm is noted in the \nlower pole of the right kidney, is noted, likely represent a \nsimple cyst. Another low attenuation lesion is noted in the \nsuperior pole of the left kidney measuring 1 cm x 0.9 cm, may \nrepresent a simple cyst.\n\nCT OF THE PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: The rectum, sigmoid \ncolon, prostate, seminal vesicles, urinary bladder, pelvic bowel \nloops are unremarkable.

EGD was unrevealing, and colonoscopy \nrevealed colitis at the splenic flexure, consistent with \nischemic colitis. Given the patient's history of atrial \nfibrillation, a CTA abdomen was done to ensure that the colitis \nwas not secondary mesenteric embolism.  CTA abdomen did not show \nocclusion of the mesenteric vessels. The etiology of ischemic \ncolitis is thought secondary to hypotension, after the patient \nhad a pre-syncopal episode. his pre-syncope was thought to be \ncaused by diahhrea from food poisoning.

There is mild \nsymmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size \nand regional\/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Diastolic \nfunction could not be assessed. Right ventricular chamber size \nand free wall motion are normal. There are three aortic valve \nleaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately \nthickened\/calcific. There is severe aortic valve stenosis (valve \narea <1.0cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The \nmitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral \nvalve prolapse. There is a minimally increased gradient \nconsistent with trivial mitral stenosis due to mitral annular \ncalcification. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to \nacoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be \nsignificantly UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are \nmildly thickened.

We spoke \nwith her PCA team to encourage sterile foley care and they \nreport some difficulty due to her infrequent BMs.\n\n# Erector Spinae Myositis\n# Pressure sore vs cellulitis\nPatient states that she had a small blister on her back that \npopped prior to admission. Physical exam with sharply \ndemarcated area of erythema in the upper mid back that was \ninitially concerning for cellulitis. MRI showed myositis and \npossible evolving phlegmon but no evidence of necrotic abscess. \n Pt was treated with vancomycin given her history of MRSA \nepidural abscess and had an elevated CK 1864 that resolved \nwithout intervention.  CRP elevated 48 but LRINEC score  1 and \nno evidence of systemic signs of infection. Patient was \nafebrile and HD stable on arrival and remained that way \nthroughout admission. Given the lack of any systemic signs of \ninfection and no change in back lesion despite multiple days of \nAbx, it was felt to be more consistent with a pressure wound \nwith underlying pressure related myositis, so vancomycin was \nstopped. Wound care consulted and managed the dressing of this \nwound.  Pt was monitored clinically for > 24hrs off \nVanc\/Ceftriaxone and continued to be afebrile without any \nchange in exam or VS.  We spoke with patient and her PCA care \nteam about any potential events where she was in the same \nposition for a long period of time that might have lead to this \ninjury.

Denies taking any oxycodone (prescribed \nlast month after valvular surgery) and was rarely taking his \nprescribed bowel regimen. Patient had been seeing Cardiology \nregularly since his discharge the month prior and came in \noverdiuresed and volume depleted, which could have contriubted \nto his constipation. Patient was admitted and overnight he was \ngiven lactulose, docusate, senna, bisacodyl PR, miralax, soap \nsuds enema, and magnesium citrate.  After the magnesium citrate, \nhe passed a minimal amount of liquid stool, however was \ndistended, nauseous and vomiting. The morning following \nadmission, stool was felt in the rectum and a rectal \ndisimpaction was performed with moderate success during \ndisimpaction and in the hour following it.  Patient was given an \nenema which he could not tolerate and manual disimpaction was \nagain attempted that afternoon.  A moderate amount of stool was \nevacuated, a mineral oil enema was administered and overnight \npatient passed a large amount of stool (first hardened stool, \nthen a large amount of diarrhea). The following morning, \npatient's symptoms had completely resolved and he was feeling \nmuch improved, tolerating PO food. He was discharged with \nmiralax standing daily, docusate standing BID, and senna BID \nprn.\n.\n# ___: On admission, patient had a creatinine of 1.5 (baseline \n1.0) and a K+ of 5.1 (on potassium supplements for hypokalemia \nat home).  His diuretics were held (torsemide) as well as his \npotassium chloride. He was given a 500cc bolus overnight. Repeat \nCr the next morning was 1.7. Likely caused by decreased PO \nintake, aggressive diuresis as an outpatient with torsemide and \nmetolzaone, and worsened overnight with stool softners and \nosmotic agents. Urine lytes show patient is pre-renal. Patient \nwas put on maintenance fluids of NS at 75cc\/hr. His Cr was \ntrending down on discharge (1.5).  Dr. ___ came by and gave \nfurther recommendations concerning his CHF management: no \nmetolazone, take torsemide 40mg daily and K+ supplements 10mg \nTID.\n.\n#Metabolic alkalosis: Patient with bicarbonate of 41 on \nadmission, likely due to contraction alkalosis: decreased PO \nintake, overly agressive diuresis. He was maintainted on IVFs \nand his bicarb was trending down on discharge (38). \n.\nChronic Issues:\n# Elevated LFTs: Chronic issue (___), GI is aware. On \nadmission, patient with AST 70, Tbili 2.3, and Dbili 0.7. Lipase \n74. No RUQ or epigastric pain. Bili has been elevated in the \nrecent past. LFTs returned to normal for the remainder of the \nadmission, with the exception of Tbili (2.8-2.9). Patient was \nmonitored for symptoms.\n.\n# Anemia: 32.0-35.6 over admission, which is slightly above \nrecent baseline (___), possibly due to overdiuresis. No \nevidence of bleeding. Hct was trended.\n.  \n# Afib: Patient maintained on warfarin 5mg daily (held the day \nof discharge for an INR 3.1 (goal ___. He was also continued \non digoxin (dig level 0.7) at his home dose.

There is mild symmetric left \nventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Overall left \nventricular systolic function is mildly depressed with \nhypokinesis of the basal and mid inferoseptal and inferior \nsegments (LVEF= 50 %). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal \nleft ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right \nventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The \naortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The ascending \naorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (?#) appear \nstructurally normal with good leaflet excursion. There is no \naortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The \nmitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral \nregurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure \ncould not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion. There \nis an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent \nfat pad. \n\nIMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mildly reduced left \nventricular systolic function with hypokinesis of the basal and \nmid inferoseptal and inferior segments consistent with coronary \nartery disease.

The patient was difficult to oxygenate at \ntimes initially.  Patient underwent trach and PEG placement in \nlight of prolonged intubation. Improving currently, he is \ntolerating trach collar at times up to 30 minutes. Speech and \nswallow are also working with him. Be sure to look for signs of \ncarbon dioxide retention if mental status worsens on PSV as \npatient could tire out at times. He is usually arousable to \nvoice, alert and can nod to yes\/no questions, oriented X3. \n\n# ADEMS: Patient underwent head MRI as well as full spine MRI as \npart of work-up of his clinical picture, and Neurology felt that \nthe findings were consistent with ADEM. He was treated with 5 \ndays of IV steroids and five more days of IVIG. The patient's \nexam improved along with repeat MRI imaging showed progression \nof the lesions, but this was in the context of improved exam \nclinically, and no further interventions were done.  His \ndiaphgram has improved function with today's NIF of -43.  He has \nslowly regaining strength in his extremities with ___ UE and ___ \nstrength (R > L).  Please continue to ensure he has ongoing \nphysical therapy.\n\n# Pulmonary embolism: Patient with saddle embolism at the OSH. \nPatient was hemodynamically stable upon arrival to ___ with \nSBP 130-140s. Patient was evaluated for thrombectomy at OSH and \nit was felt that pulmonary embolectomy would be counter \nproductive. Patient was initially continued on heparin gtt, at \none point being transitioned Lovenox \/coumadin which he \ncurrently is on with INR of 1.8 on ___, 1.8 ___. Coumadin was uptitrated to 12.5 mg from 10 mg daily on \n___.  If INR < 2.0 on ___, please consider increasing \ncoumadin to 15 mg daily.  Continue Lovenox bridge until \ntherapeutic INR.\n\n# Pericarditis: He was noted to have diffuse ST elevations on \n___.  He had not chest pain.  They resolved with \nibuprofen 600 mg TID.\n\n# Fevers of unknown etiology.  Resolved for past few days.  \nWork-up at the OSH included: negative HIV; weakly positive Lyme \nIgM, negative Lyme CSF, negative Monospot, Negative Babesia, \nNegative anaplasma, positive EBV CSF serology. ID and neurology \nwere consulted upon patient's arrival. Repeat lumbar puncture \nwas done; culture data returned showing no growth and serologies \nwere negative. The patient was initially on broach spectrum \nantibiotics upon ID recommendations, but with negative CSF \nculture data, negative CSF data antiobiotics were then peeled \nback. His fevers were attributed to ADEM and resolved week prior \nto discharge\n\n# Elevated LFTs: There was concern for viral hepatitis, though \nviral serologies at ___ returned negative.

She \nreceived a total of 20mg IV Morphine in the ED and Zofran for \nnausea. A U\/A obtained in the ED demonstrated a large amount of \nblood. Repeat CT torso images were obtained and she was \ntransferred to the floor.\n.\nOn the floor, the patient reports that her pain is pleuritic in \nnature, preventing her from taking a deep breath.

Initially, the \ndiagnosis was thought to be acute pyelonephritis with sepsis and \nearly DIC given a pelvic CT read on admission in conjunction \nwith fevers, chills, and pancytopenias. She was started on IV \nantibiotics and Heme\/Onc was consulted. They felt DIC was \nunlikely given blood work and the appearance of a peripheral \nsmear. Urology was consulted who suggested a concern for renal \nvein\/artery thrombosis due to the appearance of multifocal \nnecrosis in the kidney. An MRI revealed no acute thrombosis but \nwas suggestive of an acute infarction involving much of the \nupper pole and interpolar region of the left kidney without \nbeing able to rule out coexistent pyelonephritis. All cultures \nremained negative and a TTE for vegetations was negative, but \nshe completed a 14 day course of antibiotics for suspected \npyelonephritis. In the interim, her blood counts rebounded. \nVasculitis was also considered as an etiology for her SIRS but \nno clear evidence for a particular syndrome was found. Finally, \na PFO was detected raising concern for paradoxical embolization, \nparticularly given a history of Factor V Leiden, but work up was \nunremarkable. Ultimately, despite no clear reason for \nhypercoagulability, the patient was anticoagulated on Coumadin \nwith a Lovenox bridge as the benefits of anticoagulation were \nfelt to outweigh the risks. \n\n \nPast Medical History:\n- PFO\n- sinus tachycardia\n- Endometriosis\n- Chronic anemia\n- Migraine headaches\n- R radial nerve damage, causing a wrist drop, from compression\n- Melanoma in situ, excised from left leg, ___\n- TAH\/Right oophorectomy, ___ (complicated by bleeding post op \nrequiring 3u pRBC's)\n- Ex-lap for ruptured ovarian cyst, 1980s\n \nSocial History:\n___\nFamily History:\nFather has a history of mesenteric vein thrombosis s\/p small \nintestine resection; with h\/o factor V leiden with unknown \ngenetic profile.

Surgery was consulted \nin the ED and recommended medical management for her symptoms as \nthey felt it was most consistent with a partial small bowel \nobstruction. On the medical floor, she was made NPO and received \nIV fluids. Given the patient's history of colon cancer and \nextensive abdominal surgery in ___ for colon cancer without \nadjuvant therapy, the medical team considered abdominal CT to \nassess for tumor as the cause of her partial obstruction. \nHowever, after discussion with the patient and patient's PCP \nregarding the patient's goals of care and concern for further \nkidney damage, the test was deferred. On hospital day 2, despite \nbowel rest and IV hydration, the patient reported worsening \nabdominal pain and obstipation. Clinical exam demonstrated \nhypoactive bowel sounds. A repeat KUB suggested worsening small \nbowel obstruction,  but Surgery saw the patient again and did \nnot feel her clinical exam was concerning. They recommended a \nnon-contrast abdominal CT for further characterization and it \ndemonstrated no evidence of obstruction. In the interim, the \npatient was given fleets enemas and oral contrast for the CT \nthat enabled the patient to move her bowels. The patient \nreported frequent bowel movements overnight with resolution of \nher abdominal pain. Her clinical exam improved, she was placed \non a clear liquid diet and then advanced to a full diet without \nincident. Additionally, she was placed on daily Miralax and \ncontinued to move her bowels without difficulty, so she was \ndischarged to home with close Surgery & primary care follow-up.\n.\n# Right-sided lower abdominal pain: Patient with a chronic, \nburning pain radiating in a dermatomal distribution, over her \nright lower quadrant most noticeable when she stands. Her PCP \nhad been concerned that this represented a spinal disease \nprocess, stenosis vs. disc disease vs. metastasis. KUB and \nnon-contrast CT imaging of her abdomen and pelvis as an \ninpatient was not helpful in furthering characterizing the \netiology of this pain. MRI was considered, but the patient \ndeclined. Prior to admission, she had been taking Percocet PRN \nand had recently started low-dose Nortriptyline for improved \npain control. During her stay, her Percocet was stopped due to \nits effects on intestinal motility. She was treated with \nLidocaine patches and her home Nortriptyline with moderate \nsuccess. \n.  \n# Decreased hematocrit: Patient with chronic anemia and a Hct of \n33.3 on admission, that decreased to 28.9 on HD2 after \ncontinuous IVF's. Given her risk factor for bleeding including a \nhistory of colon cancer, diverticulosis, esophageal varices and \nchronic use of steroids, she was monitored closely during this \nadmission and an active T&S was in place. Guaiac studies were \nnegative x 2 during her stay and her Hct remained stable \nthroughout her stay, rising slightly to 30.4 at the time of \ndischarge.  \n.  \n# Chronic kidney disease: Patient with baseline Creatinine \nranging from 1.2-1.6, likely ___ chronic hypertension and \ndiabetes mellitus. On admission, her Creatinine was 1.2 and it \nremained stable throughout this hospitalization.\n.  \n# Hypertension: Patient had been taking Diovan 80mg daily and \nHCTZ 12.5mg daily at home for hypertension, but it was held by \nher PCP for unknown reasons. On admission, these medications \ncontinued to be held. In the hospital, the patient received \nIVF's, but her Creatinine remained stable at 1.2 and was \nconfirmed to be her baseline. Additionally, she had mildly \nelevated blood pressures ranging from ___ over the \ncourse of this hospitalization. She was discharged without these \nmedications abd the patient plans to re-address this at her next \nappointment.\n.  \n# Diabetes mellitus: Patient's Glyburide held in the context of \nNPO status and recent admission of hypoglycemia. She was placed \non a Regular insulin sliding scale during her stay with blood \nsugars below 200. She was discharged to home on her home Lispro \ninsulin regimen.\n.  \n# Asthma: Patient with long-standing asthma for which she takes \noral Prednisone (along with daily PPI) in addition to inhaled \nSingulair, Fluticasone, and Salmeterol at home. Her most recent \nPFT's were performed in ___ with a FEV1 of 92% and FEV1\/FVC of \n96%. On admission, the patient was without respiratory distress \nor hypoxia. Her pulmonary exam remained benign throughout this \nadmission and she was continued on her home regimen. She is \nscheduled for routine outpatient PFT's next month. \n.  \n# Wound care: Patient with a poorly healing wound in her right \nlower quadrant at the site of her surgery performed in ___. She has been receiving home ___ for wound dressings and as \nan inpatient wound care changed her abdominal dressing daily. \nHer wound remained without erythema or discharge during her stay \nand she will resume ___ services at home upon discharge. \n.  \n# Code: Patient remained FULL CODE throughout this \nhospitalization.\n \nMedications on Admission:\n1.

Patient had R chest tube inserted on \n___ and L chest tube inserted on ___. Following imaging \nshowed improvement in pulmonary status with decreased effusions, \ndecrease of R pneumothorax, and reexpansion of both lungs. Chest \ntubes were removed on ___. Patient was saturating well on \nroom air down from previous ___ L NC requirement. Additional \nproblems addressed during this hospitalization included AMS, \nhyponatremia consistent with SIADH, eosinophilia, and BPH. \n___ hospital course is summarized by problems below:  \n\n# Hypoxia: Patient was transferred here with bilateral pleural \neffusions and right pneumothorax following right thoracentesis. \nR thoracentesis at OSH removed 2.6 L of pleural fluid with LDH \nof 857 consistent with exudative effusion. Most likely bilateral \npleural effusions were secondary to pulmonary trauma resulting \nfrom rib fractures at time of motor vehicle collision. Outside \nrecords commented on sanguinous output of thoracentesis done on \n___. Bilateral effusions are concerning for CHF exacerbation and \npatient was initially diuresed at outside hospital. BNP checked \nduring this admission was elevated at 1063 with no baseline for \ncomparison. No evidence of heart failure on outside echo and \npatient was euvolemic on presentation here.  Additionally \nmalignancy may be a possible cause of current effusions. Patient \nwith SIADH, concerning head CT with osteolytic lesion from OSH, \nand generalized chronic weakness concerning for underlying \nmalignancy. No evidence of malignancy noted on Chest CT or \nskeletal survey here. Right chest tube was inserted on ___ \nand left chest tube was inserted on ___. Following imaging \nshowed decrease in bilateral pleural effusions and decrease in \nright pneumothorax. Both chest tubes were removed on ___. \nPatient was saturating well on room air afterwards. Preliminary \npleural cultures had no growth at time of discharge.\n\n# Hyponatremia: The patient was noted to by hyponatremic at OSH \nconsistent with SIADH.  Urine and Sodium lytes here were also \nsuggestive of hyponatremia from SIADH. SIADH is likely secondary \nto pulmonary processes. Hyponatremia remained stable during this \nadmission. Patient was on 2 L fluid restrictions and regular \ndiet with no sodium restrictions.\n\n#Bone fractures: There was concern for malignancy given multiple \nrib fractures, osteolytic lesion on head CT from outside \nhospital, and patient's generalized weakness at home. Skeleton \nsurvey showed no additional fractures besides those noted on \nChest CT. Additionally multiple myeloma is unlikely given \nnegative skeletal survey, normal urine total protein and lack of \nBence ___ protein, and serum protein electrophoresis showed no \nabnormalities. \n \n# Afib on coumadin: Given the pulmonary interventions done \nduring the hospitalization, patient's coumadin was held. Patient \nwas restarted on coumadin on ___. He was continued on home \ndose of atenolol 25 mg daily while in house.     \n\n# Eosinophilia: The patient was noted to have peripheral \neosinophila of 8.2. He was also noted to have 74 eosinophils in \nhis pleural fluid cell count. Likely eosinophilia is secondary \nto pleural process. Eosinophilia was monitored and was \ndowntrending at time of discharge.\n\n# BPH: Patient was started on Flomax at OSH. On renal ultrasound \nat OSH he was noted to have bladder diverticulum. Patient failed \nvoiding trial during hospitalization with a high post void \nresidual requiring foley reinsertion. He will need to followup \nwith urology as outpatient for further interventions. He was \ncontinued on flomax and sent to rehab with leg bag. Patient was \nprovided instructions on leg bag maintenance.\n\nChronic Issues:\n\n# HTN: Patient was continued on home dose of atenolol 25mg \ndaily. \n\n# Etoh use: The patient has extensive history of etoh abuse. He \nwas on CIWA at OSH, though was initially admitted there on \n___. Social worker saw patient in house and he was not ready \nto entertain the idea of quitting alcohol use.\n\nTransitional Issues:\n1. Altered Mental Status will need to be monitored\n2. Patient failed voiding trial with consequent foley \nreinsertion. Will need to f\/u with urology and discuss \nintervention\/medication optimization.\n3.

Per the patient's \nown report, he had an episode (on the evening prior to \npresentation) of difficulty putting on his clothes, as well as \nlater, he was found to have difficulty feeding himself with a \nfork at dinner. For these symptoms and the concern for stroke, \nhe was taken to an outside hospital where he was noted to be \nquite hypertensive (220s systolic). He received a large aspirin, \nsome IV hydralazine and was transported to the ___. \n\nAt ___, he was examined in our ER and his blood pressures were \nimproved to 168 systolic. His neurological examination was \nsignificant for mild inattentiveness and slight word recall \ndeficits at 5 minutes, but he had no evidence of apraxia or \nneglect. Admission labs were unremarkable. His NCHCT report \nrevealed the presence of chronic microvascular ischemic changes. \n\nDuring his admission, he remained afebrile and hemodynamically \nstable, and his blood pressures were better controlled with the \naddition of HCTZ 25mg daily. He received an MRI which showed no \nacute infarct. We spoke extensively with the patient's family \nwho reported that Mr. ___ lives by himself and is generally \nindependent with his ADLs. Recently, they have noted a slight \ndecompensation in his memory abilities as well as a tendency to \n___ objects, be disorganized and occasionally moody and have \ntantrums. \n\nOn the evening prior to his discharge, the patient had an \nepisode of agitation. He felt like we were holding him against \nhis will and demanded to be discharged to go home. He started to \nmake frantic phone calls to his daughters and tried to have them \ncome and pick him up and take him home. Ultimately, his symptoms \nimproved with ativan 1mg IV x 1, and was more redirectable and \noriented when his daughter came to visit. He stayed overnight \nand was discharged with his daughter and daughter's husband the \nnext day. A home ___ was set up prior to discharge. The family \nwas counseled about the early warning signs of dementia, the \nneed for better control of his blood pressure as well as taking \na daily aspirin. Ultimately, our rounding team felt that his \nsymptoms were likely the consequence of hypertensive \nencephalopathy. His discharge physical examination was negative \nfor apraxia, disorientation or neglect. His gait was appropriate \nfor age, and his strength was full throughout. \n \nMedications on Admission:\nASA 81 mg daily\natenolol 50 mg daily\nglyburide 5 mg BID\nmetformin 500 mg BID\noxybuytynin 15 mg daily\nActos 45 mg daily\nsimvastatin 40 mg daily\nfish oil 1000mg daily \nMVI\n\n \nDischarge Medications:\n1. atenolol 25 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).  \n2. oxybutynin chloride 5 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO DAILY \n(Daily).  \n3. simvastatin 40 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY \n(Daily).  \n4. aspirin 81 mg Tablet, Chewable Sig: One (1) Tablet, Chewable \nPO once a day.  \n5. glyburide 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO twice a day.  \n6. metformin 500 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO twice a day.  \n7.

TB felt to be extremely \nunlikely since she had no concerning findings and was well into \nher LTBI treatment course. Did not improve on doxycycline and \nflagyl (H pylori therapy). Her labs showed evidence of \nprogressively worsening inflammation during the first week of \nher hospital course. Despite a lack of overwhelming evidence \n(borderline of meeting criteria), there was a reasonable concern \nfor Still's and so per strong preference of patient and her \nhusband she was ___ on high dose steroids. Her symptoms and \nmany of her lab finding (CK elevation, ferritin, anemia, \nleukocytosis) improved on therapy. Patient discharged on 60 mg \nprednisone daily with plan for rheum follow-up. On atovaquone \nfor PCP ppx given hyperkalemia, vitamin D, calcium, PPI. \n\n# ___ on CKD stage 5\n# Hyperkalemia\n# Metabolic acidosis\n# Hyperphosphatemia\n# Hyponatremia\nPatient developed ___ during admission with creatinine up to 6, \nimproved to ~4 by discharge. Uncertain\netiology of CKD but possibly from NSAIDs or other medications \ngiven in ___. She is followed by renal transplant and \nconsidering peritoneal dialysis while awaiting transplant. \nToward the end of the admission her hyperkalemia worsened, which \nprompted avoidance of potentially contributing meds, and \naggressive bowel regimen. This was successful in improving \nhyperkalemia, but also worsened acidosis. Bicarb increased, and \nbowel regimen reduced slightly, which appeared to achieve \nappropriate balance. BMP checked afternoon of discharge to \nensure hyponatremia not worsening, and noted to have bump in \ncreatinine from 3.6 to 4.3. However in discussion with renal, \nfelt this was not contraindication to discharge given low \nclinical suspicion that this reflected a new acute process but \nrather a dramatic instance of baseline fluctuation. Patient will \nhave labs 2 days and 5 days post-discharge, which will be sent \nto Dr. ___. Patient also started on phoslo and her \ntorsemide was continued at 10 mg. Instructed to maintain healthy \nbowel regimen. \n\n#Worsening abdominal pain ___ - suspected fibroid pain\n#Menstrual bleeding\nPatient developed worsening abdominal pain on ___, and \nsubsequently developed menstrual bleeding. She stated that this \nwas similar to prior fibroid pain, which had improved 2 months \nago with initiation of depoprovera by her gynecologist. \nGynecology consulted, but at this point no hormonal therapies \nwere recommended. She was treated supportively with tylenol and \ntramadol with mild improvement. She will follow-up in \ngynecology. \n\n#ALT elevation\nNew ALT elevation noted on ___, without AST elevation. Peaked \nat 110 and started to downtrend by discharge. Likely drug \nrelated. Would follow-up as outpatient. holding statin for now\n\n# HTN\nBPs mostly 120s-150s on torsemide alone. Telmisartan held due to \nhyperkalemia. Patient takes hydralazine PRN at home. \n\n# Lower extremity edema\nProbably multifactorial including albumin and steroids. Using \ncompression stockings and torsemide with mild improvement. \n\n# Latent TB.  \nPer discussion with ID, held INH until she follows up as \noutpatient. \n\n# H. pylori gastritis\nCompleted quadruple therapy with bismuth, doxycycline \nsubstituted for tetracycline, metronidazole and omeprazole. \n\n# Hypothyroidism\nContinued levothyroxine.

Dyspnea:  \nPatient with severe diastolic dysfunction at baseline. History \nof progressively worsening dyspnea and ___ edema prior to \npresentation to ___ on ___. At time of presentation to \n___, was not impressively volume-overloaded with no JVP \nelevation and minimal ___ edema. We discovered that patient had \nlung biopsy consistent with UIP in ___, though her family \nreported very little follow-up of her IPF since that time. Due \nto her pulmonary exam and concern that the crackles represented \nher diagnosis of IPF, we looked further into IPF as a primary \ncause of her slowly progressive dyspnea. She reported some \ndyspnea with exertion, though her ambulatory oxygen monitoring \nrevealed no oxygen desats on room air. Also overnight continuous \noxygen sat monitoring revealed no overnight desats. A pulmonary \nconsult was called and a CT chest was ordered.  The CT chest \nshowed extensive interstitial lung disease with apparent \nprogression over three year period compared to CXR. Also noted \npulmonary nodule in right middle lobe which will require \nfollow-up in 3 months. Patient was started on 600 mg \nacetylcysteine TID for her IPF. Patient was set up for \noutpatient pulmonary follow-up at ___ with PFTs prior to \nappointment. Is s\/p right heart cath on ___ with note of \nslightly elevated R and L heart filling pressures. Concerning \nher heart failure, we changed home torsemide dosing to 20 mg \nBID. Added metolzone 2.5 mg each morning. We discontinued \nmetoprolol and amlodipine and started carvedilol 25 mg BID. We \ncontinue spironolactone 25 mg daily. \n\n#. Orthostatic hypotension:  \nOrthostatic hypotension on morning of ___ with low of \n64\/43 while standing with physical therapy. Was asymptomatic at \ntime of blood pressure check. Likely related to hypovolemia in \nsetting of aggressive diuresis. Had been ~4 L negative volume \nstatus in last two days prior to orthostatic hypotension. She \nreceived a 500 mL NS bolus. We reduced dose of diuretics to \ntorsemide to 20 mg BID and metolazone to 2.5 mg daily. Repeat \northostatics in afternoon of ___ were entirely normal with \nsystolic pressure around 120s. Patient was feeling well with \nnormal blood pressure on morning of discharge.\n \n#. CAD:  \nPatient with significant history of CAD and is s\/p CABG in ___. \nAt ___ had negative ___ with three negative sets \ncardiac enzymes and no reported EKG changes. We continued \naspirin, simvastatin. Changed from metoprolol and amlodipine to \ncarvedilol.\n\n#. Rhythm:  \nPatient has history of atrial fibrillation. Is s\/p AVJ ablation. \nRecent EKG with ventricular paced rhythm overlying atrial \nfibrillation. Has been on anticoagulation with warfarin, and was \nsubtherapeutic on reported warfarin dose at time of transfer. \nPrior to hospitalization patient was on warfarin 4 mg daily at \nhome, though due to subtherapeutic INR in hospital, dose was \nincreased to 6 mg daily. INR should be checked within one week \nof discharge to adjust warfarin dose.  \n \n#. Urinary Tract Infection:  \nPatient presented to ___ with note of positive urinalysis \nfor infection. Was started on ceftriaxone at ___. \nSubsequently grew Pseudomonas that was intermediate to \nceftriaxone and senstive to ceftazidime. Received 5 days of \nceftazidime while at ___ and was afebrile, without WBC \nelevation, and without urinary symptoms during hospitalization \nand at time of discharge.\n \n#. Diabetes:  \nPatient's blood sugars were high in hospital until home \nglipizide was restarted. Will likely need blood sugar monitoring \nQID until her insulin regimen can be adjusted for her current \neating habits while hospitalized. She is currently on home \nglipizide 10 mg BID as well as 16 units NPH with breakfast and \n17 units short-acting insulin with lunch and dinner.\n \n#. CKI:  \nPatient with baseline Cr of 1.3 to 1.5 per prior notes. Cr \nclimbed slightly from 1.3 to 1.6 over course of entire \nhospitalization in setting of diuresis. Will need a check of \nelectrolytes and Cr within three days of discharge.\n\n#.

Unlike previous admissions \nthe patient did not show any thought blocking, response to \ninternal stimuli, or somatic concerns. She was more genuine and \naffectively appropriate and shared her concerns regarding \npsychosocial stressors. She endorsed that she \"hears things on \nand off.\"  However, she denies many sx which bothered her during \nlast admission including; worrying that she wasn't really \nmarried; having trouble w\/ ADLs such as showering ___ \nhallucinations or parnaoia; thinking that she was someone else. \nShe does still have somatic preoccupations in regard to pain \nwhich she can't pinpoint; fear that she has a \"brain\" disease. \nWe discussed again having a repeat head CT, which Mrs. ___ \nrefused and stated that it was not medically indicated. \n     The pt received Invega sustenna IM from ___ on ___ - \nnext IM due on ___. Mrs. ___ reports that she did not f\/u \nwith services after her d\/c last month (including partial \nprogram and PACT team), but that she felt she was doing fine \nuntil a recent trip to ___. Pt explains that the heat combined \nw\/ seeing her family made her feel irritable and experience \nhallucinations. Upon returning home she felt like her life \nwasn't worth living but she denied any intent\/plan to harm\nherself. Patient's husband provided concerning collateral \ninformation in regard to alcohol use which precipitated events \nduring their ___ visit. He otherwise felt that the patient had \nbeen doing well and he didn't know she had come to the hospital. \n\n    We discussed medication options including Invega vs \nRisperdal vs Clozaril but she agreed to give Sustenna another \nchance before considering whether it was helpful or not. She was \ncontinued on her home dose of Invega with a plan to transition \nto long acting injectable only under the care of her \npsychiatrist. Her Lexapro was switched from day time dosing to \nevening dosing to faciliate and improve medication compliance. \nOver the course of hospitalization, patient denied any thoughts \nof self-harm or suicidal  ideation. She continued to have linear \nand goal oriented thought process. She did not show any obvious \nsigns of psychosis and she maintained all of her ADLs.\n\n2) ETOH ABUSE\n    We also discussed substance use and reported having 2 \nglasses of wine per week 'socially' despite later stating that \nshe drinks alone at home. Husband gave collateral that was \nconcerning for high quanitity etoh intake.  Pt was monitored for \nwithdrawal and showed no signs\/sx of such.  Pt was \nprecontemplative regarding sobriety but participated in a SMART \nrecovery meeting while on the psychiatric unit and was \ninterested in continuing this as an outpatient. We recommended \nshe participate in either AA or SMART recovery in a addition to \nmaintaining sobriety.    \n\n# Goals for discharge and Partial hospital program: Future goals \ninclude psychoeducation, medication adherence, psychotherapy, \nand reducing rehospitalization. These goals will help the \npatient make a transition back to her home and would allow her \nto better manage her mood, psychotic, and alcohol craving \nsymtpoms. The goals for partial hospital progam includes \npsychosocial support, structured environment, access to \ntreaters, psychoeducation, medication compliance, and coping \nskills. These goals are important because in the absence of this \nsupport the patient has worsening psychosis which leads to \nrehospitalization.\n\n# Medical: The patient c\/o of headaches and she refused a CT \nscan stating that she didn't feel it was medically indicated. \nShe utilized PRN tylenol and ibuprofen that helped alleviate \npain.\n\n# Social\/Milieu:\nPatient spent most of the hospitalization on the periphery of \nthe milieu, occasionally interacting and conversing with other \npatients. Rarely attended groups.\n\n# Risk Assessment:\nWhile patient has supportive husband and established care \nproviders, patient had a mild decompensation in the community, \npartially due to poor compliance and substance abuse. Risk was \nmitigated by administering decanoate antipsychotic, liasing with \nDMH, PACT team to help at home, ___ services, and the importance \nof abstinence from alcohol by going to AA and\/or SMART recovery \nmeetings. A repeat decompensation in the community is lower than \nit has been in her previous admissions since she has been \nstabilized on decoanate medications. While the patient is likely \nto deteriorate again, her safety has been good while \nhospitalized and in the community, and provided she avoids etoh \nwhich could lead to disinhibition, she is at low risk for any \nsafety problems in the community.\n\n#Prognosis: guarded to fair\n\n# Disposition: To home with outpatient follow up.\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

She was discharged with outpatient \noncology follow-up for further chemotherapy administration.\n\n# Lower extremity weakness   \n# Cauda Equina\n# Metastatic breast cancer\n# Malignancy associated pain \n# Leptomeningeal carcinomatosis   \nAmidst her known extensive metastatic disease and leptomeningeal \ndisease burden, we were concerned about the worsening weakness \nin right lower extremity as a manifestation of her disease \nprogression, which was confirmed on MRI. Pt previously had \nprogressive symptoms of cauda equina syndrome, prompting IT \nthiotepa initiation ___ with subsequent increased dose of \ndexamethasone due to worsening symptoms.  As above, she received \nthiotepa ___ due to her worsening \nsymptoms.  MRI spine ___ revealed interval worsening of \nleptomeningeal disease as well as increased size of midthoracic \nspine epidural tumor extension at T5. In discussion with \nNeuro-Oncology and in their reevaluation, they decided to \nproceed with further thiotepa chemotherapy in hopes that this \nwould help prolong her mobility but do not think that it will \nreverse weakness. They are concerned that by the time thiotepa \nhas had effect she may be immobile. Radiation oncology therefore \nevaluated patient and completed additional radiation to lumbar \nspine (___). Last dose of thiotepa administered during \nhospitalization was on ___.  She has received 4 doses of IT \nThiotepa (2 via lumbar punctures and 2 via access of the Ommaya \nreservoir).  Re-irradiation is completed and she received ___ \ncGy total dose from L1 to sacrum. \n\n[] return ___ and ___ for further dosing, for at least \nthe next 4 weeks.

Views with \nthe\nAL2 in the LMCA showed a 40-50% near-ostial stenosis. There was \na\n50% stenosis in the proximal LAD prior to the first diagonal\nbranch that appeared similar to the appearance in the prior\nangiogram from ___. The proximal LAD was calcified. D1 was of\nmoderate caliber with a proximal 50% stenosis. A larger D2 had a\nmoderate origin stenosis, a proximal 50% stenosis and diffuse\nplaquing throughout; its small medial pole had a significant\norigin stenosis (also seen on the prior angiogram). The major\ndistal D3 ran parallel to the distal\/apical LAD. The apical LAD\neither wrapped around the apex or supplied a modest caliber\ncollateral to the LPDA.\n  LCX: The LCX had a proximal 30% stenosis after a high modest\nOM1 followed by a large atrial branch. There was a large\nbranching OM2 with mild plaquing throughout that arose from a \n35%\nstenosis in the AV groove CX. The AV groove CX was severely\nnarrowed just after OM2 and then totally occluded prior to the\nseveral stents seen in the mid-distal AV groove CX (without\ncontrast filling). The atrial branch provided faint collaterals\nto the posterolateral wall.\n  RCA: The RCA could not be engaged selectively with the JR4.\nNon-selective angiography confirmed the proximal tapering and\nproximal-mid vessel diffuse occlusion seen on the prior \nangiogram\nwith delayed filling of a small caliber long RV branch.\n  SVG-LPDA: The SVG proper was patent with minimal luminal\nirregularities. There was a 40% stenosis in the LPDA distal\n(antegrade) from the anastomosis. The LPDA gave off several\nlaterally oriented sidebranches. There was retrograde perfusion\nof several LPL branches. There was also a tortuous apical\ncollateral to the RV.\n\nAssessment & Recommendations\n 1. Three vessel native coronary artery disease with moderate \nLAD\nstenoses unlikely to cause rest angina, but continued small\nvessel disease too small for PCI.\n 2.

No hemodynamic evidence of significant right subclavian\nartery in-stent restenosis.\n 5. No lesions conducive to PCI.\n 6. Suggest aggressive secondary preventative measures against\nCAD, hypertension, NSTEMI, and LV diastolic dysfunction,\nincluding continued clopidogrel for ___ year for post-MI secondary\nprevention, addition of amlodipine or other dihydropyridine\ncalcium channel blocker, maximal statin therapy, and referral to\noutpatient cardiac rehabilitation.\n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nThis is a ___ yo M with h\/o COPD, 2 vessal CAD (RCA, LCx), s\/p \nBMS to R subclavian artery, and CVA presenting with severe \ncrushing substernal chest pain.\n  \n#.

On the second day of hospitalization he \nunder went a cath that demonstrated three vesseal CAD, however \nthe stenosises were too small to explain the patient's troponin \nevalation\/symptoms and was grossly unchanged from the prior cath \nin ___.  Moreover, the patient was hypertensive with SBP's in \n180's, which ___ thought to cause demand ischemia, leading to \nelevated cardiac enzymes\/chest pain.  The patient was coninued \non his home aspirin, plavix, and statin.  He was encouraged to \nfollow up with his cardiologist and PCP for further ___.  \nAfter discharge, his PCP or cardiologist should consider \ndisconinuing plavix since it is not need for the cardiac stent. \nMoreover, the patient was encouraged to participate in cardiac \nrehab.  \n  \n#. HTN- The patient was started on an increased dose of \nmeoprolol (100, up from 50mg daily) and started on amlodipine \n5mg daily.  These interventions improved his blood pressure.

Evolving subacute ischemic changes in \nthe left parietal lobe with\nassociated foci of slow diffusion, suggesting embolic etiology \nas can detail above, involving the left cerebellar hemisphere \nand left occipital lobe. There is no evidence of hemorrhagic \ntransformation or mass effect. 2. Scattered foci of high signal \nintensity identified in the subcortical and periventricular \nwhite matter as well as in the cerebellum, likely consistent \nwith a combination of small vessel disease and lacunar ischemic \nchanges. 3. Segmental narrowing in the distal branches of the \nCircle of ___, more significant on the left middle cerebral \nartery and posterior cerebral arteries, likely consistent with \narteriosclerotic disease as described above. 4. The cervical \ncarotid arteries, and the vertebral arteries are patent with no \nevidence of flow stenotic lesions.\n\nEEG: This is an abnormal routine EEG in the awake and drowsy \nstates due to the presence of rare left centro-temporal theta \nslowing. This finding indicates focal subcortical dysfunction in \nthe left hemisphere. No epileptiform discharges or \nelectrographic seizures are seen.\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nThe patient is a ___ year old right handed man with history of \natrial fibrillation on dabigatran, and recent stroke one week \nago while on dabigatran (150BID). With his stroke one week ago, \nhe presented with right arm weakness that completely resolved.  \n\nThis admission, he presented after an episode of right leg \nparesthesias and weakness upon standing that resolved within \nminutes.  His exam on presentation was normal, however an MRI \nthis admission showed areas of restricted diffusion along the \nleft motor strip and within the left cerebellar hemisphere.  We \nwere unable to view his prior MRI from a few days ago and thus \nit was difficult to say if we were seeing the old stroke.   MRA \nshowed  irregularity towards the end of the M1 segment on the \nleft either residual thrombus from prior embolic stroke or \nin-situ atherosclerotic disease.   He is on dabigatran and \ncompliant with it (PTT supports this at 62.4).  Etiology of his \ncurrent symptoms were either ischemia in the setting of in situ \natherosclerosis or recurrentembolism.  EEG was obtained which \nshowed slowing but no frank seizures or epileptiform discharges. \n We had discussed the need for TTE to look for cardiac thrombus, \nhowever the patient left the hospital against medical advice.  \nHe was able to competently discuss the risks (permanent \nneurologic dysfunction and death) and benefits (diagnosis and \noptimized therapy).  He continued his home dabigatran and we \nrecommended he start atorvastatin 20mg daily.\n\n====================================================\nAHA\/ASA Core Measures for Ischemic Stroke and Transient Ischemic \nAttack\n\n1.

He is not acting as though he \nis having a major GI bleed as the cause of his symptoms, nor is \nthere any clear source of infection or underlying pathology to \nexplain why he would withdraw at this time. He is comfortable at \nthe time of admission.\n.\n#. Hematemesis:  The patient had one episode of \nnausea\/hematemesis after receiving PO Potasssium.  He denied any \nnausea or vomiting and was guaiac negative.   Last EGD ___ with \nno varices but does have known liver disease.  No evidence of \nongoing bleeding, abdominal pain, etc. Possible etiologies \ninclude variceal bleed, ulcer disease or ___ tear (if \nhe has vomited in the past few days). He was given Protonix IV \nBID.  Serial Hct were stable.  Liver was consulted and agreed to \ndo endoscopy non-urgently; however, given patient was \nhemodynamically unstable due to withdraw (tachycardia, agitated, \ntachypnic)- this was deferred to an outpatient process. Patient \nwas discharged with these appointments and instructions.\n.\n#. Tachycardia:  Initially sinus tachy to the 110s-130s, likely \nsecondary to fever, EtOH withdrawal, and fluid depletion.  His \nBP was consistently normal to high.  Home anti-hypertensive \n(atenolol) was changed to half the equivalent dose of \nmetoprolol.  This was additionally titrated up prior to \ndischarge.  His heart rate came down appropriately.   \n.\n# Fever and infiltrate:  CXR and CT indicated LLL pneumonia, \nlikely secondary to aspiration.  Ceftriaxone and azithromycin \nwere started for CAP, he continued to spike.  Antibiotics were \nswtiched to levofloxacin and flagyl.  Fever resolved and he \nimproved clinically at time of discharge. \n.\n#. Elevated transaminases: History of Hep B\/C.  LFTs elevated \nsomewhat above previous values on admission.  Liver followed and \nwill continue to as outpatient.\n\n#. Alcohol withdrawal:  Patient, tachycardic, tremulous, \nanxious. No history of withdrawal seizures per patient.  He was \ninitially given diazepam IV per CIWA, then converted to PO.  \nThiamine, folate, MVI were started. \n\n#. Elevated Anion Gap: Patient's anion Gap 34.  Given a lactate \nof 4 reducing with fluids, this likely represented alcoholic and \nstarvation ketoacidosis. Gap closed after hydration.\n\n#. Abnormal U\/A: + Hematuria possibly myoglobin from muscle \ndamage as 0 RBCs on sediment. Urine culture was negative. \n\n#. Paroxysmal Atrial fibrillation: Currently in sinus, will hold \nanticoagulation given bleed.  He was placed on his home \nmedications at the time of discharge. \n\n#. H\/o hypertension: Will permit him to be mildly hypertensive \nas he is now, will control hypertension via withdrawal as above \nand address any urgency without beta blockade given GI bleed.\n\n# CODE: Full \n\n# Discharge: Patient demanded to leave multiple times during his \nstay.  He initially refused EGD and all testing.  Psychiatry was \ncalled to evaluate patients ability to make decisions.  He \nvoiced appropriate understanding of the pros and cons of having \nthe procedure and that he understood the reasons of why we want \nhe to get the test (please refer to ___ for full note).  He \ncontiued to be belligerant and threatening to his medical team.  \nOn the day of discharge, he demanded to be leave the hospital \nwith or without the approval of his medical team.  Since he does \nappear to have full appreciation of his medical issues and \nunderstand the importance to follow up with outpatient doctors.  \nHe was seen by social work and physical therapy, who cleared him \nto go.

Scattered prominent but nonenlarged mediastinal \nlymph nodes. \n3.  1-cm left lower lobe nodule and 6-mm right lower lobe \nnodule.  Given size, short-term followup is recommended as these \nlesions are suspicious for metastases. \n4.  1 cm intermediate density lesion in the right interpolar \nkidney which may represent a cyst or solid lesion.  Consider \nultrasound to further \ncharacterize. \n5.  Top normal caliber of large bowel with air-fluid levels \nwithout wall \nthickening or pericolonic fat stranding is nonspecific, it could \nbe suggestive of a mild enteritis. \n6.  Trace ascites. \n7.  Small-to-moderate hiatal hernia. \n8.  Enlarged prostate. \n9.  Cholelithiasis without evidence for cholecystitis. \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nPRIMARY REASON FOR ADMISSION:\n___ year old male with CAD s\/p PCI with chronic anginal symptoms, \n symptomatic bradycardia s\/p PPM, malignant melanoma and other  \nskin cancers s\/p multiple resections and CLL with mid thoracic  \nback pain, found to have no osseous lesions but with CT scan  \nrevealing new mediastinal mass as well as pulmonary nodules.\n\nACTIVE ISSUES:\n# Elevated troponins: The patient presented with rising \ntroponins to 2.19 with Ck-MB downtrending but was chest free \nthroughout his hospital stay. He had a rest and stress perfusion \nimages reveal a fixed, moderate reduction in photon counts \ninvolving the distal anterior wall, distal septum, distal \ninferior wall and the apex.  There was also a fixed, severe \nreduction in photon counts involving the distal lateral wall and \nthe mid and distal inferior and inferolateral walls. He was \ncontinued on metoprolol, aspirin and his statin.   \n\n#Back pain: The patient's chief complaint was back pain. He had \nno signs of symtpoms of cord compromise but he did have point \ntenderness at the T11 region. . Review of his CT suggested loss \nof disc height. He could not have an MRI given his pacemaker. \nGiven his history of multiple malignancies, he underwent bone \nscan that showed T11 compression fracture but no signs of \nlesions. His pain improved prior to discharge but he may benefit \nfrom TLSO brace with ambulation for comfort. \n\n# Back rash: Prior to discharge, the patient developed a diffuse \ndark red papular rash with underlying erythema. This was felt \nlikely related to sweating and lying on the mat on his bed. It \nwill be important that his skin is kept dry and protected.\n\n# Incidental nodules\/masses: The patient was found to have a \n3.2x2.3cm anterior mediastinal mass on CT. Differential includes \nlymphoma, thymoma, thyroid lesion or germ cell tumor. He also \nhas a 1cm left lower lobe lung nodule and 6mm right lower lobe \nnodule suspicious for metastases, he should have short term \nfollow-up.

In and out of afib with RVR.  Now s\/p \ncardioversion in NSR on rate and rhythm control with coreg and \namiodarone, anticoagulated with pradaxa.\n.    \n# Chest pain and troponin elevation:  Pt described chest pain \nwith radiation to left arm and trop bump to 0.51.  Likely NSTEMI \nbut not from CAD.  Most likely due to high demand from patient's \nhtn and LVH with afib and rvr causing poor diastolic filling \ntime and wall tension.  Pt w\/ risk factors for CAD but ___ cath \nwas clean and EKG changes during hospitalization more suggestive \nof strain pattern from LVH than ACS.  BP was controlled with \ncoreg, lisinopril, and lasix.  Pt's initial ___ pressures on \nadmission were in 200s\/100, this decreased to 130s-180s\/80s-90s. \nPain resolved with decrease in heart rates and improved BP \ncontrol and was not present for the past week.  In terms of CAD, \npt's ___ risk score is >20% for CAD risk equivalent of \nsevere PAD.  Pt necessitating aspirin anyway for PAD s\/p stent \nin ___.  At this point, it is unknown what the efficacy is for \ndabigatran for primary prevention of CAD.  Pt should continue \nwith prevention including smoking cessation, lipid lowering and \nstabalization of plaques with statin therapy, and treatment of \nhypertension. \n.\n#  Atrial fibrillation with RVR, SVR, and accelerated junctional \nrhythm: Pt had atrial fibrillation that was extremely difficult \nto rate control often sustaining in 140s-160s with pauses \nlasting up to 5 seconds.  When trying to rate control with \ndiltiazem, pt went into accelerated junctional rhythms with \nretrograde p waves.  The patient has been cardioverted twice in \npast with return of atrial fibrillation.  Thus, the patient was \nstarted on amiodarone 400 mg BID for prevention of afib \nrecurrence and Pradaxa for anticoagulation. The pt had TEE and \nunderwent successful electrical cardioversion.  Notably, the \npatient reports a transaminitis with previous use of amiodarone; \nthus, he will need to be closely monitored while on this \nmedication.  Pt cannot use Droneardone given his Class II CHF \nand his CHF exacerbation while in the hospital. Amio isn't an \nexcellent option given pt's baseline lung disease with apical \nscarring, likely COPD from extensive smoking history, \nsubclinical hypothyroidism history of transaminitis while on the \nmedication, and young age.  Pt will need PFTs as pt has not had \nthis before.  Cxray and CT scan were performed during this \nhospitalization; the results of which are as above.  Pt remained \nin NSR after cardioversion.  Down the road, if rate\/rhythm \ncontrol does not ___, it is also possible to perform AVJ \nablation with PPM implantation.  CHADS score of 2 on dabigatran. \n After much discussion, dabigatran was chosen as the \nanticoagulant medication for this patient.  He reported being \ncompliant with warfarin in the past, but was annoyed by the fact \nthat he needed such frequent ___ draws.  We initially \npreferred to keep the patient on aspirin with switch to \nanticoagulant as outpatient when pt showed he was reliable.  \nHowever, after much discussion with patient and his wife, clear \nunderstanding and assurances by patient to adhere to regimen, \nand pt's request to avoid frequent lab draws, along with risk \npost cardioversion it was decided that dabigatran would be an \nacceptable choice for the patient.\n\nAlso, of note, pt had a very rapid wide complex tachycardia at \nthe time of admission.  The most parsimonious explanation would \nbe Afib with aberrancy, but the morphology of the QRS complex \nwas rather atypical for simple aberrant conduction, and there \nare periods noted on telemetry and ECG where there are wide \ncomplex beats which should NOT be aberrantly conducted.  It may \nbe that the patient has underlying atrial fibrillation, but has \na competing ventricular tachycardia that originates near the \nleft posterior fascicle.  An EP study could help differentiate \nthese, but after cardioversion, pt only manifested 3 beat runs \nof vtach, so no indication for further workup.  EP study remains \noption in future.  Such dysrhythmias during the patient's \nhospitalization made dofetilide a less appealing option.\n.\n# Acute on chronic systolic and diastolic CHF: BNP positive. On \necho, EF of 40% with severe hypokinesis of the basal half of the \ninferior and inferolateral walls c\/w prior echo.  However, there \nwas worsening of left sided filling pressures. Through hospital \nstay pt gained 10 pounds with elevation of JVD, increased \nswelling.  This responded well to IV lasix.  Pt was placed on \nlisinopril, Coreg, and lasix.  Likely exacerbated by stunned \nmyocardium, htn, rapid ventricular response.  Pt was told to \nrestrict fluid intake to diurese back to normal weight.\n.\n#SOB:  Likely from CHF in combination with baseline lung \ndisease. Pt has extensive smoking history and CXRay revealed \nflattening of diaphragms suggestive of COPD.  Air movement poor \nbut responds well to inhalers.  Started spiriva empirically with \nalbuterol prn.  CT scan shows apical scarring, I wonder if this \ncould be from his inhaled heroin use.  Will need PFTs both for \nbaseline for amiodarone monitoring as well as for \ncharacterization of potential obstructive lung disease.\n.\n# ___: Creatinine increased from baseline of 0.9 to 1.7 on night \ns\/p cardioversion.  Likely from decreased perfusion.  FEurea \nis<35%.  Pt used to be very hypertensive; likely had stunned \nmyocardium post cardioversion, together with some transient \nrelative hypotension during anesthesia causing decreased \nperfusion in the setting of a kidney that has lost ability to \nautoregulate ___ to htn.  Pt's creatinine trended down and was \nat 1.1 at discharge.  \n.\n# Groin pain: Severe but transient for one day.  Had workup with \nultrasound, hip x ray which was unrevealing.\n.\n# Dyslipidemia\/Diabetes screen: HgbA1c=6% indicates prediabetes \nand lipids with LDL 117, HDL 26; Has CAD risk equivalent of PAD. \n Outpatient physician can start nicotinic acid for HDL.  Notably \nhas strong history of myopathies with statins.  LDL should be at \n100 given CAD risk equivalent of PAD disease.  If statin to be \nadded would try pravastatin as pt has had difficulty with more \npotent statins.  \n.\n#  HTN: On lisinopril, carvedilol.  Still hypertensive to 180s \nat times.  Can uptitrate lisinopril as outpatient.  Can also \nincrease coreg to 50mg, as patient tolerated this well while in \nhospital.  Secondary causes investigated in ___ included \nangiography of the renal arteries which demonstrated no evidence \nof any flow limiting lesions, negative plasma fractionated \nmetanephrines (very high NPV), elevated urine normetanephrines, \nno evidence of coarctation, normal serum aldosterone and renin \nwhile pt was on Ace-inhibitors.  On this admission, htn assumed \nto be most likely from essential htn.  Ddx includes 1) renal \nartery stenosis--No renal bruits and tolerated ACE inhibitors \nincluding high dose captopril very well; 2) \npheochromocytoma--evaluated with plamsa and urine fractionated \nmetanephrines (plamsa normetanephrines mildly elevated but very \ndifficult to interpret in setting of opiate withdrawal, afib, \nstress etc.), 3) adrenal hyperplasia, 4) hyperaldosteronism \n(Conn's)-- no evidence of electrolyte abnormalities, and 5) \naortic coarctation-- not seen on CXRay and no pulse dissociation \nbetween upper and lower extremities.\n\nPCP can follow up with urine metanephrines at ___.  \nThese are likely nondiagnostic given in hospital setting and \nvariety of adrenergic inducing issues ongoing.  Would repeat \nafter one months time at PCP's discretion if secondary cause is \nsuspected.  To my knowledge, pt's adrenals have never been \nvisualized either.    \n.\n# Withdrawal: Started on methadone and given diazepam.  Last \ndose of methadone ___ was 10mg.  Weaning down diazepam to prn. \n Will be seen in ___ clinic today.  For smoking, given \nnicotine patches. Discharged with 6 tablets of diazepam for prn \nuse.\n.  \n# Low Urine pH: Unclear cause: drug vs infection, vs RTA?  Pt's \nbicarbonate is good.\nNegative for infection.  \n.\n# Fluctuations in Hgb:  Unclear cause; most likely ___ to fluid \nshifts from hypertension, afib, heart failure, and swings in \nvolume status\n.\n# Subclinical hypothyroidism: Elevated TSH, normal free T4. Not \ntreated.  Should continue to monitor.\n.\n# PVD: Pt with SFA and B\/L iliac stents in ___.  Stent \nintervention has greatly improved his symptoms.  Will keep pt on \naspirin.  Will continue with secondary prevention including \nsmoking cessation, lipid lowering and stabalization of plaques \nwith statin therapy, and treatment of hypertension.   \n.\n# Pneumonia: On initial admission, there was subjective fevers \nover 3 days with increased cough in setting of radiographic \nevidence of possible pneumonia. Pt treated with course of \nlevofloxacin \n.\n#CODE: Full  \n#CONTACT: Patient, wife ___ ___    \n.\nTransitional: Needs to continuing taking dabigatran.  Amiodarone \nloading now for 10g then 200 mg daily.  Need to monitor for amio \ntoxicity given previous hx of transaminitis while on drug, \nbaseline lung disease, subclinical hypothyroidism.  Needs \nbaseline PFTs.  HTN control can be more aggressive.  HDL low, \ncan try nicotinic acid, can try pravastatin or less myopathic \nstatin for goal LDL<100.

Attempts at rate control were ineffective and you had pauses of up to 5 seconds. After much discussion, it was decided to electrically cardiovert you back into sinus rhythm with prevention of future atrial fibrillation with amiodarone. It is imperative that you take your dabigatran (pradaxa) twice a day without fail. This will lower your risk of having a stroke from your paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.

He reported being unable to \ntake insulin including lantus in the days prior to admission due \nto symptoms. After admission he was initiated on treatment with \ninsulin gtt with rapid closure of anion gap. He was then \ntransitioned to home lantus and humalog insulin sliding scale. \n___ was consulted and followed along while inpatient. He had \nseveral BG lows early in admission so lantus was decreased. \nSubsequently after resumption of more normal diet he became \nhyperglycemic, which was treated by increasing dose of lantus to \n4U BID and increasing HISS with good effect. BG remained stable \nthereafter and he was discharged on this regimen. He will have \nclose follow up with ___ after discharge.  \n\n# ___, type ___: \nPatient chest pain free without prior history of ACS but \nconcerning for atypical presentation in the setting of DM on \nadmission. For this reason trop\/MB was checked and noted to rise \nto peak of 0.35 before downtrending. No ischemic changes on EKG. \nThese findings were concerning for ___, likely demand \nischemia, and cardiology was consulted. Patient received daily \naspirin and high dose atorvastatin 80 mg. Echocardiogram was \nobtained that showed focal inferior wall motion abnormality. \nHeparin gtt was initiated. Pt was taken for cardiac \ncatheterization on ___ that revealed multivessel disease with \nmid RCA 80%, LCx with mid occlusion and diffuse 20% LAD disease \nwithout focal lesion amenable to stenting. Per recommendations \nfrom Cardiology, treated with medical management. Heparin gtt \nstopped after cath. BP remained well-controlled and he was \ninitiated on metoprolol 25mg daily for rate control. Will need \nrepeat BP and HR checks in outpatient setting with uptitration \nof beta-blocker as tolerated. He was discharged with Cardiology \nfollow-up. ___ recommends consideration of outpatient Cardiac \nrehab in the future. \n\n___: \nCr elevated at 1.6 on admission (from baseline 0.9) with BUN\/Cr \nratio > 20 suggestive of pre-renal etiology. Cr downtrend with \nIVF to 0.7 prior to discharge. ACE held initially due to ___ and \n___ to allow BP room for metoprolol for rate control. \nRisks\/benefits of ACE-inhibitor will need to be reassessed in \nthe outpatient setting. \n\n#Nausea\/vomiting:\nPatient presented with nausea\/vomiting. Most likely secondary to \nDKA, although possible that viral infection such as \ngastroenteritis precipitated DKA. LFTs and lipase were all \nwithin normal limits. Treated with zofran. Symptoms resolved \nshortly after presentation and correction of BG. \n\n# Orthostatic hypotension:\nPt found to be orthostatic by vital signs after working with ___, \npt remained asymptomatic. Likely contribution from hypovolemia \ninitially given excess urine output in the setting of \nhyperglycemia. Remained orthostatic despite rehydration with \nseveral liters of IVF. Given long history of type 1 DM most \nlikely component of autonomic dysfunction as well. Remained \nstable and asymptomatic prior to discharge.\n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\n====================\n-Discharged on insulin regimen of glargine 4U BID and humalog \nsliding scale at increased doses.

The left \nventricular cavity size is normal. Left ventricular systolic \nfunction is hyperdynamic (EF 70-80%). The right ventricular free \nwall is hypertrophied. The right ventricular cavity is markedly \ndilated with depressed free wall contractility. There is \nabnormal diastolic septal motion\/position consistent with right \nventricular volume overload. The mitral valve leaflets are \nmildly thickened. There is severe mitral annular calcification. \nThere is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There \nis no pericardial effusion. \n\nCompared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) \nof ___, no major change is evident.\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ yo F with IDDM and ESRD on HD, COPD, PVD who was discharged \n___ after a complicated course s\/p AV graft placement with \nhematoma complication, and ICU stay for hypotension and NSTEMI \nlikely from demand ischemia from acute blood loss anemia, now \nre-presented from rehab with symptomatic bradycardia observed \nduring hemodialysis. Driving hypothesis is that this was a \nvaso-vagal event. The patient also had an elevated Troponin, the \netiology of which is not known. The hospital course is \nsummarized in brief by problem below:\n.\n\n# Bradycardia: Pt. was bradychardic to ___ at dialysis with \ncomplaints of pre-synchope. Common etiologies that were \nconsidered included Beta blocerks, CCB's, Amiodarone, Digoxin, \nincreased vagal tone, severe hypoxia, hypothermia and increased \nintracranial pressure. However, patient is not on any of the \nabove medicaitons. Increased vagal tone seems most reasonable \ndiagnosis of exclusion. There is no record of hypoxia during HD, \nand she does not semonstrate signs or sympotoms of ICP. \nWe suspect that this was a vaso-vagal bradychardia secondary to \nher chronic back pain in the context of an uncomfortable \nprocedure. Her bradychardia was not further observed on \ntelemetry, and not pharmacologic intervention was required. \n\n \n.  \n# CAD s\/p recent NSTEMI: currently no CP. Echo on ___ is \nunchanged from before. Official read as follows:  Left \nventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 70-80%). The \nright ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. The right \nventricular cavity is markedly dilated with depressed free wall \ncontractility. There is abnormal diastolic septal \nmotion\/position consistent with right ventricular volume \noverload. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There \nis severe mitral annular calcification. There is moderate \npulmonary artery systolic hypertension.  \nNote, we still do not have a clear reason for her Trop - T of \n9+, with subsequent Trops approx flat. CK was initially 146 but \ntrended down. ECG was not concerning for ST segment changes. \nSimvastatin 80mg was prescribed. Per prior discharge summary, \npatient was instructed to 1) continue aspirin 325mg for 30 days \nfrom start (___) and then lower to 81mg per initial cardiology \nrecs  from last discharge summary.\n2) continue plavix 75mg daily for at least one year per \ncardiology recs from last discharge summary and 3) Follow-up \nwith her cardiologist.\n.\n  \n.  \n# h\/o HTN:  Patient is not on any anti-hypertensives for unclear \nreasons. She is allergice to ACE-I's. Hydralazine and other IV \nanti-hypertensives were never required, and blood pressures were \nwell-controolled 118-133 over ___ on the night before \ndischarge. Heart rates were in the ___'s on the night before \ndischarge.\n\n.  \n \n.  \n# ESRD on HD: recently had AV graft to upper left arm (lower \nleft arm graft failed) which was complicated by hematoma and \nperioperative NSTEMI. Currently graft appears intact. Renal was \nconsulted and recommended that patient resume her T, Th Sa \nschedule. Patient was instructed that she must return to her ___ \nclinic tomorrow and resume her regular regimen. Sevelamer, \nlanthanum, and cinacalcet were continued. Epogen and Zemplar to \ncontinue as outpatient.   \n\n.  \n# IDDM:  Patient was maintained on a sliding scale with \nreasonable control of sugars.\n \n.  \n# chronic osteomyelitis: followed in ___ clinic.

She looked euvolemic on physical \nexam, but her I\/O balance has been very negative secondarily to \npoor PO, no IVF and high UOP. She had severe back after her back \nsurgery. Initially it was not clear how much it was dehydration, \npoor PO intake only taking free water and HCTZ in the post-op \nsetting vs. SIADH, most likely secondarily to pain. Nephrology \nwas consulted who recommended 3% saline. Initially we tried free \nwater restriction and follow up Na, but pt did now improve \nwithin ___ hours. PICC was placed and 3% NaCl was started. Her \nsodium was 120 upon the next lab check, and 3% was stopped. Her \npain was controlled (see below).  She was then placed on 1500cc \nfree water restriction with minimal improvement.

She should continue on \n1500cc fluid restriction daily, and 2 gram salt tabs TID on \ndischarge.  Please check electrolytes every other day to ensure \nthat sodium continues to normalize.  On discharge, sodium was \n129, and should continue to be monitored until it stabilizes \nabove 130 for several days.\n\n# Ileus - Patient with constipation noted post-operatively.  Had \nminimal improvement to soap suds enemas.  On ___ her abdomen \nwas noted to be markedly distended.  Abdominal x-ray revealed \nvery distended colonic loops upwards of 10 cm.  She was made \nNPO, a rectal tube was placed, her narcotics were decreased and \nshe was started on oral narcan for opiod contributions.  With \nfurther enemas, her abdominal distension improved markedly by \n___.  She was started on a clear diet and the rectal tube was \nremoved.  After resolution of her ileus, the patient was changed \nback to her home dose of oxycodone, but pain was not \nwell-controlled.  Consequently, her pain medications were \nincreased.

Isolated PTT elevation - Unclear etiology, no evidence of \nheparin or coumadin or lovenox, but matches well, specially \ngiven thrombocytopenia on day 5. Pt received 5 mg of PO vitamin \nK and her PTT remained unchanged.  Patient did recall a prior \nextensive workup for this abnormality in the past, but could not \nrecall her diagnosis.  She should follow-up with her PCP ___ \nhematologist as an outpatient to follow this lab abnormality.\n.  \n#. T9-l2 fusion and L1 laminectomy - pt was admitted for \nelective back surgery. She had good post-op evolution.  DVT \nprophylaxis was initially not started given increase risk of \nbleeding and recommendation of our orthopaedic colleagues.  \nHowever, during her stay in the MICU, DVT prophylaxis was \nstarted and should be continued until patient is appropriately \nambulatory.  Patient had significant post-operative pain \nrequiring significant narcotics, as noted above.  At the time of \ndischarge, the patient's narcotics regimen was oxycontin 10 mg \nBID, with oxycodone 5 mg PO q3h prn.  \n.  \n#. Hypokalemia - Pt with poor PO, no diarrhea or vomit on HCTZ. \nPt good blood pressure, but also low sodium.  TTKG was 2.8. \nCortisol was 27. She was corrected and her K remained normal.\n.  \n#. Hypertension - Pt was having sinus bradycardia to ___. normal \nrenal function.  Atenolol was initially held, and restarted with \ngood blood pressure effect.  As HCTZ was discontinued, patient \nwas slightly hypertensive on atenolol alone, and was started on \namlodipine with improved BP control.\n.  \n#. Hypothyroidism - Continued on home levothyroxane.

Small bilateral pleural \neffusions. Limited evaluation of the right lung apex. \n.\nCT head on admission:\n1. No acute intracranial process.  \n2. Near-complete opacification of the bilateral mastoid air \ncells, unchanged on the left, but new on the right.   \n3. Increased size and number of lucencies within the calvaria \nshould be \ncorrelated clinically with any history of malignancy, and a bone \nscan can be obtained for further evaluation. This finding was \ncommunicated to Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ at 12:20 a.m. via \ntelephone on ___.   \n4. Extensive paranasal sinus disease, as described above.   \n5. Extensive chronic small vessel ischemic disease, not \nsignificantly changed compared to ___. \n.\nCXR ___: \nAs compared to the previous radiograph, there is increased \nparenchymal opacity in the right perihilar lung areas. Although \nunilateral pulmonary edema would be more likely than pneumonia, \npneumonia cannot be excluded on grounds of the radiologic \nappearance.  Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette. Unchanged \nvascular stent. \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ year old ___ male with poorly controlled HIV (last CD4 \ncount 273 in ___, in-house level 52), HBV coinfection and a \nhistory of longstanding peritoneal dialysis who presented ___ \nwith mental status change, hypotension, and hypothermia.\n.\nACTIVE ISSUES\n-------------\n# Pneumonia: community acquired pneumonia vs. PCP pneumonia, \npatient is on prophylactic Bactrim at home.  He presented with \nhypothermia and altered mental status.  CD4 count was noted to \nbe 52.  Patient was initially on vancomycin\/zosyn for empiric \ncoverage, then switched to PO moxifloxacin for planned five day \ncourse after blood cultures remained negative.   Chest X-ray \nshowed perihilar opacity.  Patient will continue bactrim \nprophylaxis upon discharge.  Sputum cultures were obtained but \nwere contaminated.  Infectious disease was consulted and \nrecommended the above antibiotic therapy, as well as continuing \nprophylactic Bactrim.\n.\n# HIV: CD4 count measured at 52 during admission, viral load 88 \ncopies.  Patient was continued on his home HAART regimen, as \nwell as prophylactic Bactrim.  Patient will likely require \nre-evaluation of his HAART regimen upon discharge.\n.\n# Pancytopenia: patient was noted to be pancytopenic during his \nhospital stay, and it is unclear if this is chronic.  This may \nbe related to his HIV, or other etiology, however this was not \nworked up further due to patient's insistence to be transferred \nto ___.\n.\n# Bradycardia: on ___ patient had a pause on telemetry (8 \nseconds) with transient hypotension to the ___ and hypoxia to \nthe ___ which recovered within seconds.  Later in the evening he \nhad two episodes of bradycardia to the high ___ which was \nself-limited within seconds and asymptomatic.  Electrolytes, \ncardiac enzymes and EKG were within normal limits; a cardiology \nconsult was obtained and no further evaluation or intervention \nwas recommended.\n.\n# Head imaging abnormality: patient was noted to have lucencies \nin the calvarium on head CT.  This was not worked up further due \nto patient's insistence to be transferred to ___.\n.\n# End-stage renal disease on peritoneal dialysis: patient \npresented with concern for peritoneal dialysis port site \ninfection, with purulent fluid coming from the site.  Cultures \nwere obtained via diagnostic paracentesis and were preliminarily \nnegative upon discharge.  Patient is on Calcitriol 0.5 and \nsinacalcet 150 mg daily.  Renal was consulted for performance of \nperitoneal dialysis while patient was hospitalized.  CBC should \nbe trended for further signs of infection. \n.\n# Anemia: likely combination of bone marrow suppression as well \nas chronic kidney disease.  The patient recieved one unit RBCs \nfor Hct 22.9 with an appropriate bump to 26.9.  Epoeitin was \nheld given concern for possible malignancy on head CT.\n.\nINACTIVE ISSUES\n---------------\n# Hypertension: patient is on lisinopril and amolodipine at \nhome.  His home blood pressure medications were resumed after \nthey were initially held due to his presenting sepsis-like \npicture.\n.  \nTRANSITION OF CARE\n------------------\n# Follow-up: patient will be discharged to ___ per \nhis request.  Patient will require antibiotics to finish course \nof antibiotics for community acquired pneumonia.  Blood cultures \nand peritoneal cultures are currently pending and will need to \nbe followed up.  There was also concern for malignancy of CT \nhead that will need to be followed up.  This was not addressed \nduring the ___ hospital stay given his refusal for further \nwork-up.  He should receive CBC and Chem10 every day for \nmonitoring.  Epoietin is being held at the current time due to \nthe concern for malignancy on CT head.  This should be \nre-evaluated in the near future.\n. \n# Code status: presumed full\n.\n# CONTACT: patient, ___ (___) ___ \n.\n\n \nMedications on Admission:\nCalcium Carbonate 600''\nLamivudine 50'\nEpoetin ___ ___ monthly SQ\nGentamicin cream apply daily to the exit site\nLisinopril 10'\nNorvasc 10' (hold for hypotension)\nPhosLo 3 tabs with meals 667'''\nPotassium Salts 10'\nPrilosec 20'\nRocaltrol 0.5 mcg'\nSensipar 150'\nViread 300 PO Qweek\nZerit 15'\nZyprexa 5'\n \nDischarge Medications:\n1. lamivudine 10 mg\/mL Solution Sig: Fifty (50) milligrams PO \nDAILY (Daily).  \n2. calcium carbonate 600 mg (1,500 mg) Tablet Sig: One (1) \nTablet PO twice a day.  \n3. lisinopril 10 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily). \n \n4. amlodipine 5 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).  \n\n5.

Upper \nlungs are clear. Pleural effusion is minimal if any. Heart size \nnormal. \n___ CXR: One supine portable AP view of the chest. Low lung \nvolumes. The left lower lobe opacity likely represents \natelectasis. There is a small left pleural effusion, if any. No \nopacities concerning for pneumonia. Heart size is difficult to \nevaluate, but likely normal. Mediastinal and hilar contours are \nnormal. No pneumothorax. \n___ ECHO (prelim): Due to suboptimal technical quality, a \nfocal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall \nleft ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). A \nmid-cavitary gradient is identified. Right ventricular chamber \nsize and free wall motion are normal. No mitral regurgitation is \nseen. No aortic stenosis or regurgitation. IMPRESSION: \nSuboptimal image quality. Preserved biventricular function. \n___ CXR: The ET tube sits 5 cm above the carina. The \nendogastric tube side port tip sits well below the GE junction. \nA right IJ central line tip sits in the lower SVC. The heart \nsize is within normal limits. The mediastinal contours \ndemonstrate calcified atherosclerotic disease of the aortic \nknob.  There is a small to moderate left pleural effusion with \nassociated atelectasis. There is no pneumothorax. Severe \ndegenerative changes are seen in the left glenohumeral joint. \nIMPRESSION: 1. Lines and tubes in place. 2. Small to moderate \nleft pleural effusion with associated atelectasis. \n___ CXR: 1. Left pleural effusion appears unchanged and \nright pleural effusion is likely increased. Assessment is \nslightly limited due to different positioning of patient.  2. \nMild pulmonary vascular congestion. \n___ ___: No evidence for DVT.\n___ KUB: Air filled dilated loops of large and small bowel \nare most \nconsistent with an ileus. \n___ CT abd: 1. Splenorrhaphy, with mild perisplenic \nhemorrhage and Surgicel packing. 2. Small pleural effusions, \nmild ascites, and anasarca. No evidence of intra-abdominal \nabscess, within limitations of a non-contrast study. 3. Left \ncolectomy and transverse colostomy, without complications. \n___ There has been interval removal of the right IJ central \nvenous \ncatheter tip. The heart size is large. The mediastinal and hilar \ncontours \nare unchanged. There is a moderate left pleural effusion with \nunderlying \natelectasis. Mild right basal atelectasis with a small pleural \neffusion is \nalso present. IMPRESSION: Bilateral pleural effusions, left \ngreater than right, with associated atelectasis. \n___ CXR: Assessment of the heart size is limited by the \nlarge left and small right pleural effusions with associated \natelectasis; an additional component of pneumonia, particularly \non the left cannot be excluded. Within that limitation, the \nheart size likely continues to be enlarged. There is no fluid \noverload. There is no pneumothorax. \n___ Comparison is made with prior study performed the same \nday earlier. Moderate left pleural effusion has markedly \ndecreased. Adjacent atelectases have decreased. There is a new \nleft basal pigtail catheter. There is no evident pneumothorax. \nmild-to-moderate right pleural effusion with adjacent \natelectasis, is unchanged. Cardiomediastinal contours are \npartially obscured by pleuroparenchymal abnormalities. \n.\n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nHopsital course: Patient admitted to plastic surgery service \n___ in anticipation of gastrocnemius flap to RLE chronic wound \ndehiscence.  Preoperative workup completed ___ uneventfull \nand patient taken to OR for flap procedure ___.  Tolerated \nprocedure well and was transferred to ___ for further \nmanagement.  Recovery proceeded uneventfully until ___ when \npatient demonstrated altered mental status, nausea, vomiting and \nincreasing abdominal distention.  Transferred to MICU ___ for \nthese symptoms and surgery consult obtained for concern of \naltered mental status and worsening abdominal distention (See \nACS Consult note for further details).  Patient taken to OR by \n___ for colonoscopy with assistance of GI given concern for \nsigmoid\/cecal volvulus.  Colonoscopy failed to demonstrate \nvolvulus and exploratory laparotomy was undertaken which \nrevealed necrotic splenic flexure.  Left colectomy was performed \nwith mid transverse colon ostomy and long ___ pouch.  \nPatient tolerated procedure well and was brought to ___ for \nfurther management under ACS service. Post-operatively, the \npatient was brought to the TSICU intubated\/sedated.  Patient \nextubated successfully ___ and IV pain regimen initiated prn.  \nThis was carried out with good effect and adequate pain control. \n When tolerating oral intake, the patient was transitioned to \noral pain medications. She was then transfered to the floor on \n___. She had urinary retention issues and a foley was placed \nwhich stayed in throughout hospital course as she failed 2 \nvoiding trials. She was given methylnatrexone x1 and was started \non a regular diet. However, she had some emesis and a KUB showed \nileus. She began to produce stool in her ostomy on ___ and her \ndiet was advanced to regular which she tolerated well. Her WBC \nbegan to rise so a CT abd\/pelvis was performed to r\/o abscess \nand no intra-abdominal abscesses were identified. She had a \nchest x-ray on ___ which showed bilateral pleural effusions. \nShe continued to have a cough and medicine was consulted to \nevaluate. Thoracentesis was performed and 1.5 liters of \nexudative fluid was drained (LDH 312, WBC 3100). Pigtail \ncatheter was placed which drained minimal serosangeous fluid. \nThis was thought to be related to the abdominal surgery and \nresultant inflammation of the LUQ. Her WBC dropped from 20.8 to \n14.5 with the thoracentesis.  Patient remains feeling well \nwithout and is without fevers off all antibiotics. \n.\nPulmonary: Pulmonary toilet including incentive spirometry and \nearly ambulation were encouraged.  The patient was stable from a \npulmonary standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored. CXR \non ___ showed bilateral pleural effusions L>R. She \ncontinued to have a cough and will be transferred to the \nmedicine service for further evaluation and management. \nThoracentesis was performed and 1.5L transudative fluid was \ndrained, effectively resolving her cough. WBC dropped from 20.8 \nto 14.5 with the procedure. Patient remained tachypneic, and \ngiven her vascular congestion on xray, she was administered \nlasix with good urinary output. No antibiotics were \nadministered, as there was no clear infection to be treated \n(afebrile, feeling well off antibiotics).  Pleural fluid studies \nwere consistent with effusion secondary to adrenergic state \nlikley ___ splenic flexure infarct and splenic laceration.  Rpt \nchest X-ray showed improving pleural effusion s\/p thoracentesis \nand her lung exam continued to improve until the day of \ndischarge.\n.\nGI\/GU: Post-operatively, the patient was given IV fluids until \ntolerating oral intake. Her diet was advanced to sips ___ and \nregular diet ___.  Patient demonstrated some nausea w emesis \n___ and was made NPO.  Advanced from sips to clears ___ \nwhich was tolerated well. Given methylnaltrexone ___.  Had gas \nand stool in ostomy ___.  She was also started on a bowel \nregimen to encourage bowel movement. She was started on a \nregular diet on ___ which she continued to tolerate well.\n.\nID: Post-operatively, the patient was started on IV cefazolin, \nthen switched to PO cephalexin on POD#2. The patient's \ntemperature was closely watched for signs of infection. Her WBC \nbegan to slowly uptrend, for which a clear source was not \nidentified. She was given roughly 4 days of \ncipro\/flagyl\/vanc\/cefepime, all of which were discontinued \naround ___. U\/A blood, urine, and c.diff was negative, her \ngraft site did not appear infected, CT ab\/pelvis on ___ was \nnegative for any intra-abdominal abscess, and CXR was signficant \nonly for bilateral pleural effusions L>R. No antibiotics were \nadministered as patient did not have a clear source of \ninfection.  All culture data was negative, she continued to be \nafebrile and VS were stable.  Her WBC was fluctuating and also \nwith a reactive thrombocytosis.  Given no objective signs of \ninfection antibiotics were never started.\n.\n# Reactive thrombocytosis: likely in relation to inflammatory \nstate from necrotic bowel, recent operations and pleural \neffusions irritating the pleural lining.  This will need to be \ntrended with repeat CBC within 1 week.\n.\n# Hyponatremia: Patient admitted with Na+ 129, corrected to 139, \nnow ___. Thought to be SIADH vs. hypervolemic hyponatremia as \npatient appears somewhat overloaded on exam (1+edema with \nascites and large pleural effusion). Serum osm is low (262), \nhowever urine lytes suggested patient was prerenal. Given IV \nlasix for fluid overload and sodium initially trended up to 130, \nbut then decreased to 126.  There was likely a combine picture.  \nLasix were stopped and the patient equilibrated to 130 at time \nof discharge.  She will need repeat lab work within 1 week to \nre-evaluate Na levels.\n.\n# Urinary Retention: Patient failed trial of voiding twice while \ninpatient.  Urology was consulted and they felt that given \nrecent operations and shock likel state it may take some time \nfor her bladder to regain function.  She will be discharged with \nher Foley in place and follow up with urology within ___ weeks \nfor another trial of voiding. \n.\n#. ___- Patient had transient ___ to 1.9 on ___, when she was \nseptic and necrosing her bowel. Creatinine improved with fluids \nand was likely prerenal in etiology given her septic physiology. \n  \n.\n# Anemia: remained at basline over admission (___). No signs \nof bleeding. Iron borderline low and ferritin high, MCV normal \n(89). Possibly anemia of chronic disease. Hct trended.\n.  \n#. HTN: continued HCTZ, lisinopril, diltiazem, ASA\n.  \n#. HL: continued atorvastatin, ASA\n.\n#. Hypothyroidism: continued levothyroxine\n.\n#. Glaucoma: continued latanoprost, dorzolamide\n.\nTransitional Issues:\n- At the time of discharge on POD 15, the patient was doing \nwell, afebrile with stable vital signs, tolerating a regular \ndiet, ambulating, with foley in place, and pain well controlled. \nPatient failed 2 voiding trials, and is being discharged home \nwith foley in place.

POD7 the patient had emesis and was backed down \nto NPO with IV fluids. Abdominal x-ray was consistent with \nileus. POD8 the patient had more emesis, distention, and WBC \nbumped up to 13.7. NGT was replaced with large amount of bilious \noutput. CT abdomen \/ pelvis was obtained which showed \npostoperative ileus. There was no recurrence of obstruction. \nPOD10, the patient was given oral contrast down his NGT. An \nabdominal x-ray eight hours after administration of oral \ncontrast showed contrast in the rectum. POD11, the patient was \nhaving bowel function. The NGT was removed and the patient was \nagain given clear liquids which were advanced to regular food \nwith good tolerability. \n\nWhen tolerating a diet, the patient was converted to oral pain \nmedication with continued good effect. The patient voided \nwithout problem. During this hospitalization, the patient \nambulated early and frequently, was adherent with respiratory \ntoilet and incentive spirometry, and actively participated in \nthe plan of care. The patient received subcutaneous heparin and \nvenodyne boots were used during this stay.\n\nAt the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile \nwith stable vital signs.  The patient was tolerating a regular \ndiet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, having bowel \nmovements, and pain was well controlled on tylenol.

CTH\/MRI brain \nrevealed only chronic findings. Neurology evaluated patient, \nconsidered seizure, and EEG was performed (though was when \npatient was improved), and was negative. While EEG did not \ndefinitively r\/o seizure as it was done when her mental status \nhad returned to baseline, it had no suspicious findings so AED \nwas not started. \n\nAs per discussion with patient's oncologist, she has had similar \nencephalopathic episodes with prior admits, so may be more \nsensitive to stressors (dehydration, pain, SOB, hypoxia) as a \nresult of prior prophylactic cranial irradiation or other CNS \ninsult in the past. \n\n#SOB\n#Acute Hypoxic Respiratory Distress\nShortness of breath likely multifactorial including known mass \n(recurrent SCLC) causing atelectasis\/compression RML\/RLL as well \nas lymphangitic spread in RUL, and growing effusion, now \nmoderate causing further mass effect.

They also found that she had paradoxical motion of \nright hemidiaphragm likely ___ malignant involvement. They noted \nthat her respiratory status is extremely tenuous given multiple \ninsults to her lung and noted that IP intervention was not \npossible. \n\nOnce mental status resolved and patient was returned to normal \nopiate regimen, her dyspnea was well controlled. I strongly \nencouraged patient to quit smoking and asked that she avoid \nAtivan as it made her very sedated on admission. \n\n#Elevated Troponin\nPatient with elevated troponin, possibly ___ increased demand \nduring acute hypoxic resp distress as above.

Subacute well-defined hemorrhage in the left medial temporal \nlobe without surrounding edema. Small amount of blood products \nis also seen in the ventricles, which could be secondary to \nextension of blood products from this abnormality. The \nappearances are nonspecific, but given the location, primary \nhemorrhage is less likely and an underlying condition like \ncavernous malformation should be considered. Gadolinium-enhanced \nMRI can help for further assessment. \n2. Increased signal in the splenium of corpus callosum can be \nseen in \npatients with seizure and postictal stage. However, subtle \nincreased signal within the pyramidal tracts bilaterally is \nunusual for postictal status. This could reflect degenerative \nchanges within the pyramidal tract.

Her hospital course \nis as follows:\n.  \n# Agitation\/altered mental status: Was initially unclear what \ncaused alteration in her mental status.  At baseline she has an \nodd affect and is intermittently confused.  She was afebrile and \ndid not have any evidence of infection.  LP was performed and \nwas unremarkable.  Neurology was consulted.  EEG was performed \nand was negative for seizure, only with slowing near the area of \nher bleed.  CT scan showed her old stable bleed.  Her blood \nsugar was normal.  MRI showed a bulbous basilar artery but \notherwise was unremarkable for a cause of her symptoms.  \nPsychoactive medications were held.  We continued her keppra at \ncurrent dose.  Her confusion returned to baseline during the \ncourse of her admission.  Her altered mental status was likely \nmultifactorial to include medications, as well as her \nhypercarbia, OSA\/COPD (see below).  She should follow up with \nneurology\/neurosurgery as an outpatient.\n.\n# Hypercarbia\/COPD\/OSA: She was initially admitted intubated, \nbut was extubated after 24 hrs.  ABG showed mild hypoxemia with \np02 in the ___ as well as significant hypercarbia, with pC02 \nin the ___, occationally in the 100s.  CXR was unremarkable \nfor infection.  We continued her bronchodilators.  During her \nadmission she had periods of somnolence possibly due to \nincreased carbon dioxide retention in the setting of untreated \nOSA.  She was tried on autoset CPAP initially however this was \nnot effective for her.  She was briefly sent to the floor but \nreadmitted to the MICU after increased somnolence.  Sleep was \nfinally consulted.  She had an inpatient sleep study which \nestablished BIPAP settings for her.  She will require follow up \nsleep study and titration as an outpatient.  She continued to be \ndelirious with periods of waxing and waning agitation.  \nAccording to her husband, her mental status prior to her \ndischarge was similar to her baseline.  AutoSet BiPAP setting: \n--___ Imax=20cm max I-E gap 10cm at night for now (can be \nordered through ___ - the contact there is \n___, ___, cell ___\n--Please call ___ to arrange follow-up with sleep to \narrange formal outpatient BiPAP titration to further tailor \nsettings in the future\n.  \n# Recent Left temporal hemorrhage: Was stable on CT and MRI.  We \ncontinued her keppra and held her coumadin and plavix.\n.  \n# Paroxysmal Atrial fibrillation: Was in sinus rhythm throughout \nadmission.\n.  \n# Type II DM: Her oral hypoglycemics were held in favor of \nsliding scale.  However, her medications were restarted once she \nstabilized.  Januvia was not on formulary and was therefore \nheld.  This will need to be restarted after discharge.\n.  \n# COPD: h\/o second hand smoke exposure, appears to be chronic \nCO2 retainer based on her ABG, with pC02 ranging from 80-100 at \nbaseline.

Her last baseline from ___ \nyear ago was normal  Seen by nephrology, feels that this is \nhyponatremia from free water intake and tea and toast diet, also \nwas on HCTZ. Clinically euvolemic. Her HCTZ was stopped and \nsodium improved. Sodium was 134 on discharge. HCTZ was not \nresumed.\n\n#Headache\n#Nausea, vomiting\nThe patient had ongoing headache with nausea & vomiting.  CT \nhead noncontrast without acute pathology noted. Neurology was \nconsulted and recommended MRI brain. Initial MRI had some \nenhancement which was consistent with either inflammation or \nartifact. This was repeated and felt to be artifact. The patent \nwas started on low dose nortryptiline to manage headache. \nDespite these interventions, her headache persisted. Improved \nwith sumatriptan 25 mg x1 and transition from Zofran to reglan \non ___. On ___ she was feeling much improved, with only mild \nleft frontal headache and mild nausea, also with improving \nappetite and no vomiting today. She felt ready for discharge to \nhome. She declined LP as advised by Neurology, but was fully \nagreeable to close follow-up in Neurology clinic.  Discharged on \nNortriptyline 10 mg PO QHS standing, plus PRN sumatriptan for \nheadache (goal of taking less than 4 tabs per MONTH), and PRN \nmetoclopramide for nausea.  ESR was added-on on ___ labs per \nrequest of Neuro (for consideration of GCA, though overall they \nmaintained low suspicion for this). Neuro team (Dr. ___ \nwill f\/u the ESR result.\n*Of note, patient drinks significant amounts of coffee at \nbaseline, and says that when the nausea\/vomiting started, she \nstopped drinking coffee.  This may have contributed, at least in \npart, to her headache.\n\n#Hematuria\nThe patient had one episode of gross hematuria followed by \nmicroscopic hematuria. She had no UTI symptoms and no evidence \nof kidney stones. She was referred to urology as an outpatient. \n\n# Asymptomatic bacteriuria\nPatient had + UA and initial UCx grew mixed bacterial flora. \nRepeat UA on ___ was also positive (large leuk esterase, neg \nnitrites, >182 WBCs) and UCx from that specimen grew 2 \nmorphologies of E. Coli. This E. coli was resistant only to \nTMP-SMX.  Had extensive discussion with pt. prior to discharge, \nin which she denied having had any urinary symptoms (dysuria, \nburning with urination, urinary frequency, urinary hesitancy, \netc.) nor any infectious symptoms such as fevers, chills, \nrigors, or sweats prior to the onset of her nausea, vomiting and \nheadache.  Given the absence of any symptoms to suggest true \nurinary tract infection, no abx were administered during this \nhospitalization.\n\n#HTN\nContinued home lisinopril, held HCTZ while inpatient and on \ndischarge. Remains normotensive at time of discharge, but may \nultimately require addition of a new anti-hypertensive agent for \noptimal BP control.  Would avoid thiazide diuretics in her case \ngoing forward.\n\n#HLD\nContinued home simvastatin\n\n#CKD stage 3\nFairly stable stable, Cr 1.7 on discharge, which is near her \nbaseline of 1.5 from ___.

Has Nephrology \nf\/u scheduled for ___\n\n2) Discharged off of HCTZ in light of hyponatremia. BP OK on day \nof discharge, but she may ultimately need initiation of another \nBP agent.\nPlease see discharge summary for additional details.\n\n3) Discharged on new daily medication for headache \n(Nortryptyline 10 mg PO QHS) and PRN medication for headache \n(sumatriptan 25 mg PO PRN MR1). Also discharged on new \nmedication for nausea (reglan 10 mg PO q8h PRN).

No biliary ductal dilation.\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nThis is a ___ old male with HCV cirhosis complicated by HCC \ns\/p RFA, cyberknife, and sorafenib with recent admissions for \nIVC thrombus and hemothorax now admitted for shortness of breath \nand flank pain.  \n\n#Dyspnea: On admission the patient was found to have a small \nL-sided pleural effusion on CXR, and moderate ascites on \nphysical exam.  The dyspnea was thought to be secondary a \ncombination of the effusion and the restrictive effect of the \nabdominal ascites.  O2 remained stable on room air throughout \nthe hospitalization.  Given the patient's renal function \n(discussed below), the team was concerned about the effects of \nparacentesis on the patients kidneys.  Once the patient's \ncreatinine was stabilized and trending towards baseline, a \ntherepeutic paracentesis was done, removing 3L.  The patient \nimproved symptomatically.  \n  \n# ARF: The patient was admitted with rising creatinine to 2.1 \nfrom his baseline of 1.2.  As per the patient, his PO intake had \nbeen poor.  He was also noted to have a UA indicative of UTI \n(moderate leuks, moderate bacteria).  At that time, it was \nthought that infection was less likely the cause of his ARF, \nespecially given the patient's stable clinical picture.  \nHowever, the patient was started on cipro in the ED prior to the \nsending of urine cultures.  Cipro was continued on the floors \nfor presumed UTI.  Given the concern for pre-renal syndrome the \npatient's diuretics were held and he was started on IV fluids.  \nGiven the patient's liver disease, HRS was also considered, and \nthe patient was started on octretide and midodrine.  Given the \nconcern for the patients ARF, a therepeutic paracentesis was \ndeferred.  The creatinine continued to rise to 2.8 before \ntrending downwards.  At this point it was decided that, given \nthe patients discomfort, it would be reasonable to attempt a \ntherapeutic paracentesis.  The peceived 25g albumin after the \nparacentesis.  The patient was discharged and instructed to \ncomplete a 7day course of cipro for a presumed UTI.  He was also \ninstructed to have his VNS draw blood in 1 week to monitor his \nkidney function.  It was arranged for the patient do follow up \nwith his primary care doctor and with the ___.\n.\n#Hyperbilirubinemia. The patient presented with a rising \nbilirubin (1.5 baseline to 7.3 at admission).  There were no \nsigns of SBP on diagnostic paracentesis. No other acute \nprocesses were identifed on U\/S, although no comment was made on \nthe biliary system.  At the time it was thought this was \nconcerning for disease progression or HCC progression--a prior \nCT on ___ had demonstrated progression.  Given the ongoing \npresumed UTI, infection was also considered.  With the \nimprovement in the patient's kidney function and acute symptoms, \nit was decided to follow his LFTs and possible disease progress \nas an outpatient.  He was arranged to have follow up with the \nLiver Clinic.  \n.\n# HCV Cirrhosis\/HCC c\/b ascites, PVT(and smv thrombosis):  The \npatient was admitted with rising LFTs, thought to be secondary \nto disease progression in the setting of an acute UTI.  An U\/S \ndemonstrated a markedly heterogeneous liver and signs of portal \nvein thrombus.  His AFP had risen to 4.3 from 2.4 two weeks \nprior.  As discussed above, the patient was clinically stable, \nso it was decided to manage his chronic liver disease as an \noutpatient.  He was arranged to have follow up as discussed \nabove.  \n\n# Moderate-severe malnutrition: Prior to his admission, the \npatient had poor PO intake and was underweight.  The patient had \nagreed to have a dobhoff tube placed to initiate tube feeds. On \nthis admission, the dobhoff was placed and tube feeds were \ninitiated without issue.  The patient was educated on proper \nuse\/maintenance of the pump\/tube and was discharged home with \nVisiting Nursing Services.  \n\n#Code Status: The patient was full code throughout the \nhospitalization and at discharge.  \n \nMedications on Admission:\nLasix 40 mg daily\nSpironolactone 50mg BID\nDilaudid 4 mg Q6H prn for pain\nIpratropium MDI\nMetoprolol 25 mg po tid\nProchlorperazine 10 mg Q8H prn\nSorafenib (on hold as of ___\nDocusate 100 mg po bid\nomeprazole 20 daily\nSenna\n \nDischarge Medications:\n1.

The vertebral artery is patent with \nantegrade flow. IMPRESSION: There is less than 40% stenosis \nwithin the internal carotid arteries bilaterally.\n\nTTE ___\nConclusions The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild \nsymmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size \nand global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal \ntechnical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be \nfully excluded. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall \nmotion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (?#) appear \nstructurally normal with good leaflet excursion. There is no \naortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The \nmitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral \nregurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The estimated \npulmonary artery systolic pressure is high normal. There is a \ntrivial\/physiologic circumferential pericardial effusion. \nIMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mild symmetric left \nventricular hypertrophy with preserved global biventricular \nsystolic function. No valvular pathology or pathologic flow \nidentified. No definite structural cardiac source of embolism \nidentified. Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of \n___, the findings are similar.\n\nMRI\/MRA Brain\/Neck ___\nFINDINGS: MRI Brain: There is no evidence of acute intracranial \nhemorrhage, edema, masses, mass effect, midline shift or slowed \ndiffusion to suggest acute infarction. Chronic right MCA \ninfarction involving the right frontal lobe, insula, and basal \nganglia, with associated volume loss. There also chronic \ninfarctions in the bilateral cerebellum. Wallerian degeneration \nright brainstem. Confluent periventricular, deep, and \nsubcortical white matter T2\/FLAIR hyperintensities are likely \nsequelae of severe chronic small vessel ischemic disease. MRA \nbrain: There is moderate severe right and moderate left \ncavernous segment ICA narrowing. Moderate right and mild left M1 \nsegment narrowing. Right A1 segment is hypoplastic or occluded.. \nWidely patent left A1, A-comm supplying both PCAs. Moderate \nnarrowing distal left V4 segment. Diminished flow related \nenhancement in the right V4 segment. Moderate to severe \nnarrowing left P2 segment. Mild-to-moderate narrowing left P3 \nsegment moderate to severe narrowing right P3 segment. The \nintracranial vertebral and internal carotid arteries and their \nmajor branches appear patent without evidence of occlusion, or \naneurysm formation. Incidentally, the distal cervical left \ninternal carotid artery is tortuous (7:21). MRA neck: Motion \nartifact and aliasing limit evaluation of the proximal common \ncarotid and vertebral arteries. The distal common carotid and \nvertebral arteries appear patent, without evidence of stenosis \nor occlusion.. Widely patent left proximal ICA without narrowing \nby NASCET criteria. Motion artifact limits evaluation of the \nproximal right ICA. Origins of the great vessels, subclavian and \nvertebral arteries are not well evaluated, due to motion. Small \nleft pleural effusion partially seen. IMPRESSION: 1. No evidence \nof acute intracranial hemorrhage or infarction. 2. Extensive \nintracranial atherosclerotic disease involving anterior, \nposterior circulation. No occlusion. No aneurysm.. 3. Motion \nartifact limits evaluation of the neck vessels.\n\n___ ___\nIMPRESSION: 1. Suggestion of gray-white matter differentiation \nloss in the left frontal lobe, consider acute infarct. 2. \nChronic right hemispheric, right basal ganglia and cerebellar \ninfarct. 3.

NOTIFICATION: The updated \nimpression and recommendations were communicated via telephone \nby Dr. ___ to Dr. ___ at 11:15 on ___, 10 min \nafter discovery.\n\nRenal US ___\nFINDINGS: The right kidney measures 9.2 cm. There is a large \nsimple cyst in the upper pole of the right kidney measuring 3.1 \nx 3.9 x 3.1 cm. The left kidney measures 10.0 cm. There is a \nsimple cyst in the interpolar region of the left kidney \nmeasuring 1.8 x 2.5 x 1.9 cm. There is no hydronephrosis, \nstones, or masses bilaterally. Normal cortical echogenicity and \ncorticomedullary differentiation are seen bilaterally. The \nbladder is only minimally distended and can not be fully \nassessed on the current study. IMPRESSION: Normal renal \nultrasound with bilateral simple cysts. No evidence of \nhydronephrosis bilaterally.\n\nCXR ___\nFINDINGS: Left-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates at the SVC\/right \natrial junction. Lung volumes are low. Heart size remains mildly \nenlarged. The mediastinal and hilar contours are similar. \nCrowding of bronchovascular structures is present with probable \nmild pulmonary vascular congestion.

At baseline, she is verbal, bed\/wheelchair-bound \n(can transfer with 1-man assitance bed-to-chair) and lives in a \ngroup home with visits from her parents. Her group home \ncontacted ___ (see OMR note ___ re. decreased ability \nto transfer and leg pain with leg giving out starting last \n___. Her appointment was moved up to this coming ___, \nand Ortho evaluation of the leg was advised. Today, they called \nDr. ___ the ___ service) with continued \nconcern about her inability to transfer; apparently she fell or \nslumped over in the last few days with the toilet and is \nrequiring additional\nassistance with transfers. She was advised to come to the ED for \nevaluation.\nShe arrived with her mother, who seems to think that the leg \nproblem is pain-related (patient endorses this, and says that \nher knee hurts; not sure why and neigther is her mother other \nthan pointing out a superficial bruise on the patella). The \nmother said that her main concern was not the leg, but rather \nher\nperception that the pt is \"over-medicated\" and less responsive \ntoday than usual, which she noticed on visiting this morning at \nthe group home. The mother wants her \"blood levels checked\" and  \nthen followed up in clinic this coming week, and she would like \nto go back to the group home, where she thinks ___ can be \nbest taken care of. She does not hope for inpatient admission.\nThe patient repeatedly expressed a desire to put her clothes on \nand eat and leave the hospital.

She says that ___ may have seizures all \nthe time, and points out a variety of facial expressions and \npauses and eye movements that seem subtle to me (or in some \ncases not appreciable), and says they often swipe the VNS magnet \nfor such behaviors. She does not think this is a significant \nchange today, and thinks that grogginess from over-medication is \nthe problem. No recent infection.

No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. \n\nUA negative\n\n___ Video swallow\nIMPRESSION: Normal oropharyngeal swallowing videofluoroscopy.\n\n___ MRI Head c\/s contrast\nThe ventriculostomy via the right transfrontal approach has been \n\nbetter characterized in the recent CT. The markedly dilated \nventricular \nconfiguration, right greater than left, is unchanged compared to \nprior CT \nstudies.  \n  \nAlong the right parietal convexity, there is an avidly enhancing \nrounded \ndural-based lesion, measuring approximately 2.3 x 1.9 cm, \nrepresenting a \nmeningioma. A smaller right posterior parasagittal rounded \ndural-based lesion  (image 11:8) also represents a meningioma. \nThere are flat dural-based lesions  with similar avid \npost-contrast enhancement in the right parasagittal frontal  \nconvexity (image 11:19), the left infrafrontal convexity (image \n11:12) and a  tiny one in the left frontal parafalcine region, \ncompatible with en plaque  meningiomas. The multiplicity of \nmeningiomas in light of ___ history of  radiation suggests \nthat these are most likely radiation-induced meningiomas. There \nare burr holes in both sides of the frontal andparietal regions. \nThere is no abnormal restricted diffusion to suggest acute \nischemia. IMPRESSION: 1. Multiple avidly enhancing dural-based \nlesions, compatible with meningiomas. Given the history of \nwhole-brain radiation, these may represent radiation-induced \nmeningiomas. 2. Unchanged dilated ventricular configuration, \nwith right transfrontal ventriculostomy drain. 3. No acute \nischemia. \n\nEEG: Final report pending. EEG showed diffuse attenuation with \nsuperimposed moderate voltage beta activity, evolving to \nrepetitive spikes over the left parietal region, then diffuse \nspike and wave activity.  The seizures lasted between 30 and 90 \nseconds.  Otherwise, she appears to be at her baseline.\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ h\/o epilepsy related to resected R parietal astrocytoma \ns\/p VNS and R frontal meningioma p\/w difficulty transferring \nto\/from bed.\n\n[] Left Knee Pain - The patient presented with report of \ndifficulty with transfers, possibly due to pain from her left \nknee with some initial evidence of mild bruising. She was \ndescribed as not putting weight on her legs and not locking her \nknees. Fracture and DVT were excluded with imaging. Orthopedics \nevaluated her knee and detected the presence of what is likely a \n___ cyst. They did not feel an acute intervention or imaging \nwas needed, but did suggest an MRI of the knee as an outpatient \nif the pain persists. An AFO for the left ankle (foot drop) was \nrecommended and ordered.\n\n[] Epilepsy - The patient did not have any increased frequency \nof seizures reported, but she did have a relatively high \nfrequency of electrographic and clinical seizures noted on \ncontinuous video EEG. Her Zonisamide was increased to 300 mg \nQHS. The semiologies included [1] right arm myoclonus with left \narm extensor posturing, loss of awareness, with post-ictal \nlethargy, and [2] arm extension, loss of awareness.\n\n[ ] Low grade temperatures - The patient had two low grade \ntemperatures to 100.1-100.2. Her stress dose hydrocortisone \nprotocol was initiated and an infectious workup was pursued. \nHowever, the fever resolved without intervention, likely \nrepresenting aspiration pneumonitis in the setting of likely \naspiration while her level of awareness was altered by her \nseizures.\n\n[ ] Performing MRI - Of note, there were concerns about how to \nperform the MRI regarding the ___ VNS stimulator and \nconcerns about \"metal\" related to the ventriculoperitoneal shunt \ntubing that remains in the ___ intracranial space. The VNS \nwas turned off prior to the procedure by one of the Epilepsy \nnurses and restarted after the MRI.

You were seen by our spine surgeons, who did not think surgery was necessary for you. It was recommended that you were treated primarily for pain control. Although you have a diagnosis of alcohol-related neuropathy, we also checked your vitamin B12 levels, which were low. This can also contribute to peripheral neuropathy. We started you on B12 supplementation to help with neuropathy. Because of the concerns for home safety and fall risk, you were seen by physical therapy twice during this admission. We have collaborated to create a comprehensive fall risk management plan for you, please see below. In addition, you were admitted to the hospital due to low blood sugar."}

Minimal retrolisthesis of C5 over C6 is \nof \nindeterminate age, but likely degenerative.  Degenerative \nchanges.Partially \nimaged thyroid gland appears mildly prominent but not fully \nimaged or well \nassessed on this study, correlate with thyroid function tests \nnon urgently.  \nNo discrete thyroid nodule is identified \n  \nEKG ___:\nNormal sinus rhythm. Normal ECG. No significant change compared \nto the previous tracing of ___. \n\nCT upper ext ___:\nIMPRESSION:    \n1.   Transverse impacted fracture of the distal humerus \nmetadiaphysis with posterior displacement of the distal end of \nthe proximal fracture fragment. The fracture plane extends \nthrough the lateral epicondyle and the superior aspect of the \nmedial epidcondyle.  There is suggestion of areas of sclerosis \nalong the fracture edges that raises the possibility of a \nsubacute or chronic \nfracture. \n2. Surrounding soft tissue edema, hematoma, and joint effusion \nnoted.   \n3.  The radio capitellar and ulnar trochlear articulations \nremain congruent, as does the proximal radioulnar joint.  . \n\nCXR ___:\nIMPRESSION:  \n  \nAs compared to the previous radiograph, no relevant change is \nseen.  Mild \noverinflation.  Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette \nwithout pulmonary edema.  Mild bilateral apical thickening.  No \npleural effusions. No pneumonia, no pulmonary edema. \n\nV\/Q Scan ___:\nIMPRESSION:   Normal VQ scan.  A normal V\/Q scan rules out \nrecent pulmonary embolism. \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nMs. ___ is a ___ year old woman with past medical history of \ncongenital single kidney, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and \nperipheral vascular disease s\/p bilateral stents in ___, who \npresented ___ after a mechanical fall. She underwent an open \nreduction internal fixation of the distal right humerus on ___. \nShe was found to be hyponatremic and with an increasing \ncreatinine level, and was transferred to medicine on ___.\n\n#Distal right humerus fracture: S\/p ORIF ___ by orthopedic \nsurgery. Pain was controlled with oxycodone.\n\n#Hyponatremia: Patient was asymptomatic. Serum Na was 121 at \nadmission, and improved to 125 by time of transfer, after \nreceiving ___ L over two days. Her serum osmolality was 261, \nurine sodium 25, and urine osm 297. She appeared clinically dry \non exam. She was bolused with 1 L normal saline x2 on ___ and \n___, and sodium improved to 132 upon discharge. She had been \ntaking hydrochlorothiazide at home, which likely contributed to \nher hyponatremia. She was advised to avoid diuretics in the \nfuture, unless otherwise instructed by a health care provider \nfamiliar with her history, and only with close monitoring.\n\n___: Patient was admitted with a creatinine of 1.3, and this \nincreased to 1.8 over 1 day. This appeared to be prerenal ___. \nAfter bolusing the patient with IVF as above, creatinine \nreturned to 1.2 prior to discharge. We do not have a baseline to \ncompare to as patient has not had follow-up in primary care for \nyears. This should be followed and worked up appropriately on an \noutpatient basis. \n\n#Anemia: on ___ patient was found to have hemoglobin\/hematocrit \n6.9\/20.7 down from ___ on ___, and 10.6\/28.5 upon admission. \nShe was transfused with 1 unit of PRBCs and hemoglobin increased \nappropriately to 8.6. Anemia studies were sent, and looked to be \na mixed picture of iron deficiency anemia and anemia of chronic \ndisease vs inflammation after surgery. Per orthopedic surgery, \nit is normal for patients to lose blood after surgeries, and she \nwas having no other source of blood loss, so this is the likely \ncause of her acute drop. Patient was not started back on home \nplavix during hospitalization in the setting of recent bleed.\n\n#HTN and tachycardia: Patient initially told the team she was \nnot taking any medications at home. After further investiation, \nwe found that prescriptions were being refilled in her name. On \nfurther discussion, it became clear that she was taking these \nmedications, although she had been reluctant to share this \ninformation given that she did not have a PCP managing these \nmedications. Home meds were atenolol, hydrochlorothiazide and \nlisinopril. She appears to have developed rebound tachycardia \nand hypertension in the setting of these medications being held \nperioperatively. Prior to learning that she was taking these \nmedications, we started her on amlodipine. Blood pressures only \nmildly improved over a 1.5 day period on amlodipine, not enough \ntime to see a full effect. Heart rates peaked in 110s-120s, and \nSBPs 150s-180s. We sent patient for a V\/Q scan to rule out \npulmonary embolism in the setting of recent surgery, \ntachycardia, and t wave inversions in III and flatening in V3 in \nan EKG showing sinus tachycardia. V\/Q scan was reported as low \nprobabily for PE. She was discharged with home atenolol and \nlisinopril, and the amlodipine started while hospitalized. She \nwas not continued on hydrochlorothiazide as explained above.\n\n#O2 requirement: upon transfer, occupational therapy was working \nwith the patient and she was found to be desatting with \nambulation on RA to mid ___. She was not complaining of \nshortness of breath, and we do not have a baseline level of \nactivity or oxygen requirements for her. Her chest X-ray and \nlung exam were both non concerning for acute pulmonary process \nor pulmonary edema. OT recommended patient attend rehab after \ndischarge. She is an active smoker, and should likely undergo \nformal PFT testing as outpatient.\n\n#Bilateral lower leg scratches: Patient noticed to have \nsignificant self-induced scabs and scratches on both of her \nlegs. She says she gets dry skin and scratches her legs. We \nordered aquafor for skin hydration and changing of the bandages \ncovering the legs, with excellent effect.\n\n#Hyperlipidemia:  Continued Atorvastatin 20 po nightly\n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES\n#Restart plavix\n#Outpatient lung CT scan in smoker\n#Outpatient PFTs\n#Smoking cessation counseling\n#Echo to evaluate systolic heart murmur (last done ___ years \nago)\n#Medication management and prescription management \n#F\/u with orthopedic surgery \n#DEXA Scan\n#F\/u H\/H, anemia workup\n#Continue to trend creatinine\n#Continue to trend sodium, avoid diuretics if possible, as \npatient becomes hypovolemic and then hyponatremic\n#Code status: FULL\n#CONTACT: ___, Brother, ___\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

You were found to have a fracture of your arm, and this was corrected by surgery with the orthopedic surgery team. While you were hospitalized, you were noticed to have a low sodium value and decreased renal function, and you were transferred to the general medicine team. The reason your sodium was low and your renal function was decreased was that you did not have enough fluids in your system. This is likely because you were taking a diuretic medication called hydrochlorothiazide. We gave you IV fluids, and these problems corrected. We recommend not using diuretics in the future as this may worsen this problem. In addition, you were found to have a low red blood cell level, or anemia, during your hospitalization. The likely cause of the acute drop in blood was your surgery."}

Degenerative changes are \nnoted at the triscaphe, first CMC joints as well as the MCP, PIP \nand DIP joints in a pattern suggestive of osteoarthritis.  There \nis dorsal soft tissue swelling.  Vascular calcification is \npresent.\n \nIMPRESSION: \nChronic deformity at the distal radius without evidence of acute \nfracture or dislocation. Degenerative disease as stated above. \nDorsal soft tissue\nswelling.\n\n___ CXR\nPA and lateral views of the chest provided.   There is an aortic \nvalvular\nstent in place.  There is a small left pleural effusion with \nbasilar\natelectasis.  High other congestion is noted without frank \npulmonary edema.  Mild scarring in the left suprahilar region is \ncompatible with an area of post radiation changes adjacent to a \nfiducial marker.  No pneumothorax.  The mediastinal contour \nstable.  Bony structures appear grossly intact.\n \nIMPRESSION: \nAs above.\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nMr. ___ is an ___ with dCHF, AS s\/p TAVR, SCLC s\/p \ncyberknife, chronic hypoxia on home O2, recently admitted for \ndCHF exacerbation who presented with low grade fever and right \nhand swelling and initially admitted given concern for \ncellulitis, ultimately determined to have a gout flare.\n\n# Gout flare: This likely occurred in the setting of \noverdiuresis during his prior admission. He was treated with a \nshort course of prednisone with resolution of his symptoms. He \nwas not treated with colchicine or NSAIDS given renal \ncompromise. He was discharged on his home allopurinol, renally \ndosed.\n\n# dCHF: He was recently discharged from the hospital after a \ndCHF exacerbation. His home torsemide was increased from 20 mg \ndaily to 30 mg daily during his last admission. He presented \nwith ___ and ___ elevated BNP and difficult exam it was \ninitially thought that he was slightly volume overloaded and his \n___ was ___ cardiorenal physiology. His renal function worsened \nwith diuresis suggesting he was actually overdiuresed (this is \nalso consistent with the rationale for his gout flare). Over the \ncourse of 3 days in the hospital his renal function improved \nwith holding diuresis. On the day prior to discharge his \ntorsemide was restarted at a lower dose- 20 mg and reassuringly \nhis renal function continued to trend toward his baseline. It \nappears that 20 mg of torsemide was too low of a dose for him \nwhile 30 mg was too high. He is discharged on an alternating \ndosing schedule: Torsemide 30mg 3x per week (MWF) and 20 mg 4x \nper week (___). He was counseled by nutrition re: low \nsodium diet. He is scheduled for close follow up with his PCP \nfor repeat labs and weight. \n\n# ___: Initially thought secondary to cardiorenal physiology as \nabove, though ultimately determined to be secondary to \noverdiuresis. Diuretics were held after initial diuresis and \nwere restarted at a lower dose prior to discharge. His \ncreatinine trended to baseline on day of discharge. His \nmedications were renally dosed and he was discharged on a lower \ndose of allopurinol per renal function.\n\n# Leukopenia: Mr. ___ white blood cell counts during his \nadmissions are notable for recurrent episodes of leukopenia. \nUnclear if this is related to myelosuppression. He had no \nevidence of infection and clinically otherwise appeared well.  \n\n# HTN: Well controlled on amlodipine and lisinopril\n\nTransitional Issues:\nHe is discharged on the following regimen:\nTorsemide 30 mg ___\nTorsemide 20 mg ___\nHis WEIGHT ON DISCHARGE: 112.2 kg.\n\n- Please obtain repeat chemistry panel and CBC to ensure \nstability of renal function and resolution of leukopenia\n- Continue to counsel patient on low sodium diet\n\nMed Rec:\n- Discharged on LOWER dose of allopurinol ___ mg daily instead \nof 200 mg daily) given compromised renal function\n- Discharged on alternating dose of torsemide as above\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

There is mild symmetric \nleft ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Left \nventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). A mild \nmid-cavitary gradient is identified. Right ventricular chamber \nsize and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at \nthe sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. There is no \naortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The \nmitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral \nregurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity \nof mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] \nThere is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is \nno pericardial effusion. \n\nIMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with \nhyperdynamic biventricular systolic function. Mild mid-cavitary \nobstruction. Mild pulmonary hypertension.\n\nMRI:\nFINDINGS: There is evidence of slow diffusion in the right \nparamedian pons, \nwith corresponding hypointensity in the ADC map, suggesting an \nacute right \nparamedian pontine infarct, likely due to occlusion of a \nperforator arising \nfrom the basilar artery. No other infarcts are identified. There \nis no \nevidence of hemorrhage, edema, masses or mass effect. Bilateral \nperiventricular and subcortical white matter FLAIR \nhyperintensities suggest \nchronic microangiopathic ischemic disease. Ventricles and sulci \nare normal in \ncaliber and configuration. A right maxillary sinus \nmucus-retention cyst is \npresent. \n  \nIMPRESSION: \n1. Acute right paramedian pontine infarct, no acute hemorrhage \ndetected. \n2. Chronic small vessel ischemic disease. \n  \n\nCTA:\nHEAD CT: There is no evidence of hemorrhage, edema, masses, mass \n\neffect or infarction. The ventricles and sulci are normal in \ncaliber and \nconfiguration. The gray and white matter differentiation is well \npreserved.  \nMultiple subcortical and periventricular white matter \nhypodensities relate to \nchronic microvascular ischemic disease. The basal cisterns are \nwidely patent. \nThe osseous structures are unremarkable. The mastoid air cells \nare clear.  \nMild mucosal thickening is noted in bilateral ethmoid air cells. \n\n  \nPERFUSION: The perfusion maps appear normal with no evidence of \ndelayed \ntransit time, or reduced blood flow or blood volume. \n  \nHEAD AND NECK CTA: Mild atherosclerotic calcification of the \naortic arch and \norigin of the left subclavian artery are noted. There is a \nnormal \nthree-vessel aortic arch. The cervical portion of the common \ncarotid arteries \nand internal carotid arteries are unremarkable except for mild \natherosclerotic \ncalcification of the carotid bifurcation, right greater than \nleft, without \nsignificant stenosis at this level. Both vertebral arteries are \ncodominant.  \nMild calcification without significant stenosis is noted at the \norigin of the \nright vertebral artery (3:82). The left vertebral artery origin \nhas mild \ncalcification, but no significant stenosis. Additionally, mild \nright \nvertebral artery calcification is seen just before it enters the \ntransverse \nforamen (3:106). \n  \nHEAD CTA: Mild calcification is seen in the bilateral cavernous \ninternal \ncarotid arteries without significant stenosis. The major \nbranches of the \ninternal carotid arteries are normal without evidence of \nflow-limiting \nstenosis, occlusion or aneurysms greater than 2 mm. Both \nvertebral arteries, \nbasilar arteries are normal without evidence of occlusion, \nflow-limiting \nstenosis or aneurysms greater than 2 mm. \n  \nIMPRESSION: \n  \n1. No acute intracranial hemorrhage or infarction detected. \n  \n2. Normal CT perfusion. \n  \n3. No occlusion, flow-limiting stenosis or aneurysm greater than \n2 mm \ndetected in the head and neck vessels. \n\nCXR:\nCHEST, AP: Lung volumes are low, with crowding of \nbronchovascular markings.  \nPrior left lower lobe opacity has resolved. The \ncardiomediastinal and hilar \ncontours are normal. There are no pleural effusions. \n  \nIMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process. \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nThe patient presented with one day of facial droop and slurred \nspeech with an episode of slurred speech two days prior.  She \ncame to the hospital and had a CT scan in the emergency room \nwith a CTA.  There was no obvious stroke on the CT and no \nperfusion abnormalities seen in the hemispheres of the brain.  \nShe was admitted to the neurology service for further workup out \nof concern of a stroke.\n\nThe CTA did not show any significant stenosis of the vessels of \nthe neck and the brain.  An MRI was obtained and a small right \nsided pontine paramedian stroke was observed.  This is likley \ndue to small vessel disease and undelrying conditions such as \nhypertension and hyperlipidemia.  \n\nNeuro\n- The patient was started on an enteric coated aspirin.

Her anemia work up was ultimately consistent \nwith iron deficiency anemia. the acuity of her Hct drop was \nsuscpicious for a likley GI source. The patient was transfused 2 \nunits on admission with an appropriate response in Hct. Her Hct \nremained stable during her hospital course, and she did not \nrequire subsequent transfusions.  The patient had a previous \nEGD, and several colonoscopies, in the past for work-up of her \nanemia. The scopes have been notable for multiple polyps ( s\/p \nresection), and diverticulosis, without out any source of active \nbleeding identified. She was re-evaluated by GI this admission, \nand underwent EGD only. The patient adamantly refused \ncolonoscopy this admission, as she did not want to undergo the \nprep. The EGD was ultimately unrevealing in identifying the \nsource of bleeding. The patient was discharged with GI follow up \nfor  capsule endoscopy and colonoscopy. She was also discharged \nhome on ferrous sulfate 325mg three times a day for iron \ndeficiency anemia and stool softeners.  \n\n# Demand Ischemia- On admission the patient was found to have \nnew ST segment depressions in lateral leads and elevated \nTroponin to 0.08. The patient likely had demand ischemia in \nsetting of severe anemia. Her troponin down  trended to 0.04. \nShe was monitored on  telemetry with no significant events. She \nwas chest pain free during the admission.\n\n# Uncontrolled insulin dependent diabetes mellitus IDDM- The \npatient's blood glucose levels were significantly elevated on \nadmission and difficult to control during her hospital course \nwith initial FSBGS in  the 300s -400s. The patient was \npreviously on 10 units of NPH in the morning. ___ was \nultimately consulted and switched the patient to ___ insulin \nat lunch ( since dinner is the patient's heaviest meal at home) \nwith a sliding scale. She achieved better glycemic control on  \nthis regimen. She was ultimately discharged home on 18 units of \n75\/25 at lunch as a new outpatient regimen. She will follow up \nwith her PCP in the next week for follow-up regarding her new \ninsulin regimen\n\n# Cognitive ability- . The patient was formally evaluated by \noccupational therapy with concern regarding her  short term \nmemory and ability to self administer her medications, more \nspecifically insulin. Occupational therapy found the patient to \nhave Impaired Insight,Impaired Memory: short term and \nrecall,Impaired attention, and Impaired abstraction.

There is hydrocephalus. Hemorrhage is present within \nthe lateral \nventricles bilaterally. A small amount of subarachnoid \nhemorrhage is \nidentified in the right occipital pole. These findings appear \nsimilar to \nthose detected on the CT scan. There is extensive \nperiventricular white \nmatter hyperintensity on the FLAIR images. This may reflect a \ncombination of \nchronic small vessel ischemia and transependymal resorption of \nCSF related to \nhydrocephalus. There is no evidence of infarction on the \ndiffusion images.  \nThere is no abnormal enhancement after contrast administration. \nThe MRA \nexamination demonstrates a normal appearance of the left \ninternal carotid \nartery as well as the anterior and middle cerebral arteries. The \nleft \nanterior cerebral artery A1 segment is dominant with only a \nsmall right A1 \nsegment. The right M1 segment of the middle cerebral artery \nappears \nattenuated. There is narrowing and irregularity of the T2 \nsegment of the \nright posterior cerebral artery, likely due to atheromatous \ndisease. \n  \nCONCLUSION: Left caudate and putaminal hematoma with \nintraventricular \nextension and hydrocephalus. \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nMs. ___ was admitted to neurology service for evaluation and \ntreatment of intracerebral hemorrhage.  She was admitted to \nneurology stroke floor with telemetry for close monitoring. She \nwas ruled out for cardiac enzymes and EKG which did not show \nevidence of myocardial infarction. \n\nShe was closely monitored with frequent neuro checks and \nexaminations to note for any new signs and to assess for signs \nof improvement. She underwent CT\/ MRI\/A for which showed an \nacute hemorrhage in left basal ganglia region, and evidence of \npossible old bleed in right occipital region. Blood pressure was \nin the range of 120- 140 systolic. Though the location of bleed \nis more typical for hypertensive hemorrhage, her blood pressure \nwas not sufficiently elevated. The more likely mechanism \ntherefore, was thought to be amyloid angiopathy, also supported \nby diagnosis of dementia and previous bleed. \nAspirin was held due to ICH. She was started on heparin SC for \nprevention of DVT after 72 hours. HCTZ was increased to 25 \nmg\/day to achieve even tighter control of blood pressure. She \nwas seen by ___ therapy who suggested acute rehab for \nplacement. Diet was modified and advanced per swallow evaluation \nrecs. This should be followed up closely with frequent \nevaluations to assess swallowing function and diet should be \nadvanced\/ monitored per recs.\nHer HBA1c was 5.3 , and Lipid profile showed LDL of 165, hence \nstarted on simvastatin at discharge.

We think this is due to having too much salt in your diet and having a low protein level in your body. It will be very important for you to stick to a low sodium diet as much as possible and eat a high protein diet. You underwent a therapeutic paracentesis (removal of fluid from your abdomen) and we took off 6 liters without problems. Your kidney function had decreased a little bit. We think this is due to the diuretics (furosemide and spironolactone) that you were taking.

Patient had decreased PO \nintake and felt dizzy before syncope, may have been due to \northostatics or hypoglycemia? Of note, the patient had elevated \nBS and increased UOP upon presentation.  Does have questionable \nhistory of PE but O2 sat normal on RA throughout admission and \nthe patient does not have SOB or chest pain. Because we could \nnot determine the etiology of the patient's syncope, we had \nneurology evalutate him and they felt that the patient may have \nhad a seizure. He had an EEG, head CT, and MRI which were all \nnormal. He had no further episodes of either seizure or syncope \nwhile inpatient. \n.\n# HA: Patient has HA in setting of hypertension and possible \nrelative dehydration. Initial presentation was concerning as he \nalso complained of blurry vision in only the R eye. Head CT and \nMRI\/MRA negative for acute intracranial process. No focal \ndeficits on neuro exam.  Headache improved during inpatient stay \n(as did his blood pressure). \n.\n# Visual Changes: Vision R eye better than L although he \nreported R visual changes. No visual field cut. Head CT \nnegative. Seen by opthomology, found to have ___ vision b\/l. \nOpthomology thought patient may have combination of hypertensive \nretinopathy and some contribution of DM. \n.\n# Rash on neck: Looks like folliculitis vs cellulitis. Pt seen \nby ID. Initially started on broad spectrum - Vanc\/levoquin, \nwhich was backed off to Bactrim BID before d\/c. Improved during \nstay.\n.\n# Hydratinitis ___: Multiple small draining areas in the \ngroin w\/out obvious fluctuance, erythema, tenderness, or warmth. \nBecause the areas were purulent material we had a groin \nultrasound done which was inconclusive for abscess. Surgery was \nconsulted and thought there was nothing to do and ID, who was \nalready following the patient felt that the lesions were c\/w \nhydratinitis ___ and were unlikey superinfected. They \nrecommended a short course of Bactrim and Derm vs plastic \nsurgery follow up.\n.\n# DM: Standing insulin regimen adjusted during inpatient \nadmission with marked improvement in ___. Patient encouraged to \nf\/u with ___ clinic to acheive better glucose control as \nthis will be very important to his overall health and ability to \nheal his skin lesions. \n.\n# HTN: BP elevated on admission but pt improved with \nconsistantly taking his home medications. He was encouraged to \nf\/u with his primary care physician to determine whether these \nmedications need to be adjusted. \n.\n# Abdominal Pain: The patient had an acute episode of severe \nabdominal pain associated with self-reported reduction of an \nabdominal hernia. He was seen by surgery and had an abdominal CT \nwhich showed no acute intra-abdominal process including \nobstruction or bowel perforation. His pain improved over the \nnext ___ hours and was back to his baseline level of chronic \nabdominal pain at this point.\n.\n# Thrombocytopenia: The patient had 1x lab result that showed \nseverely decreased platelets. We attempted to verify this result \nbut were unable to obtain blood from the patient. We started him \non argatroban for presumed HIT and d\/c his heparin products. We \nplaced a picc line from which we drew repeat labs which showed a \nnormal platelet count. A repeat lab was sent to verify this \nresult and the platelet count was normal on this lab draw as \nwell so the argatroban was d\/c and his heparin sq was re-started \nwithout incident.  \n.\n# FEN: diabetic diet\n.\n# Prophylaxis: SQH  \n.\n# Access: PIV, PICC \n.\n# Code: full  \n \nMedications on Admission:\nMetoprolol Succinate XL 200mg PO QD\nSimvistatin 40mg PO QD\nSulfaalazine 1500mg PO BID\nValsartan 80mg QD\nAmlodipine 10mg PO QD\nISS\n \nDischarge Medications:\n1.

In the ED his temp was 102.9, pulse 132, \nBP 154\/93, RR 18, 98% RA.  Blood pressures then began to drift \ndown to SBPs in ___. His peritoneal fluid analysis showed >5000 \nWBC. Lactate was elevated and rising, peaking at 4.5 on HD#2. A \nleft IJ was placed by ___ and he was initially started on IV \nVanco\/Ceftaz\/Cipro\/Flagyl then on HD#2 regimen was simplified to \nIV Vanco alone. A second peripheral IV was placed.  \n.\nFollowing recommendations from the renal service, he was \ninitially started on q2h periotoneal dialysis with alternating \n2.5% and 4.25% diasylate in order to flush out the peritoneal \ncavity well. On HOD#3 his dialysis regimen was changed to q4h. \nOn HD#4 his vanc was given intraperitoneally and allowed to \nbathe peritoneal cavity about 6h. His fever, abdominal pain, and \nnausea greatly improved during the first 24h of his \nhospitalization. He did not vomit. Peritoneal gram stain showed \ngram positive cocci in pairs and chains. Perineal culture grew \ngroup B strep. Blood gram stain also showed gram positive cocci \nin pairs and chains. Blood cultures grew out group B strep in 1 \nof 2 bottles.  \n.\nPt was transferred to floor where he was clinically improving, \nhemodynamically stable and afebrile.  A transthoracic \nechocardiogram did not show evidence of valvular vegetations.  \nHe had no clinical signs or symptoms of endocarditis.  The \nvancomycin was continued with intraperitoneal dialysis.  \nFollow-up peritoneal cultures showed no growth with 3+PMNs.  \nFollow-up blood cultures were pending at the time of discharge, \ndrawn on ___.  Pt is to follow-up with the renal services at \nhemodialysis on ___ for a trough vanco level \nand vancomycin dosing.\n.\n# Hypotension: Pt was hypotensive upon admission, likely due to \nlow vascular tone in the setting of sepsis, and challenges of \nfluid balance with PD treatments. However, while in the ICU he \nmaintained SBP above 90 without pressors or fluid boluses. On \ndischarge, pt's blood pressure remained normotensive without \nfurther episodes of hypotension during this hospitalization.\n.\n# Hypoxemia:  Pt was hypoxemic upon arrival to the MICU, with O2 \nsaturations around 92%. CXR showed no sign of infiltrates or \npulmonary edema. The etiology was thought to be COPD given pt's \ntobacco use hx. He had slight expiratory wheezes, for which he \nreceived albuterol. He was put on O2 by nasal cannulea, which he \nwas later weaned off and he was able to breathe comfortably. For \nthe remainder of this admission, he was not hypoxic and \nmaintained normal oxygen saturations on room air.  He did \ncontinue to have expiratory wheezes for which he recieved \nalbuterol and atrovent nebulizer treatments as needed.\n.\n# ESRD on PD : \nPt was initially begun on q2h periotoneal dialysis with \nalternating 2.5% and 4.25% diasylate. On HOD#3 his dialysis \nregimen was changed to q4h. His PD fluid contained heparin. He \nwas continued on his home Renagel, Calcitriol, Sensipar.\n.\n# Episodes of tachycardia: Pt had several assymptomatic and \nself-resolving several hour periods of tachycardia. Thought to \nlikely represent a chronic arrhythmia, such as multifocal atrial \ntachycardia. This was monitored throughout his stay but did not \nwarrant intervention. Several ECGs did not demonstrate any \natrial fibrillation.  Pt was asymptomatic during these episodes \nof tachycardia.\n. \n# h\/o HTN: Pt was not hypertensitve during this admission.  \nAnti-hypertensive medications were not given.\n.\n# DM:  His blood sugar was checked q4h. His sugars remained \nbelow 200 so he did not require insulin. He received gabapentin \nand ASA on home doses.\n.\n# Chronic Back pain: Stable while in the hospital. He was \nwritten for his home methadone, but did not receive it because \nhis blood pressure was somewhat low and he could tolerate the \npain.  Upon leaving the MICU, pt was given oxycodone PRN for \npain management.  His blood pressures were stable and he \ntolerated this medication.\n.\n# Depression: He was continued on his home Mirtazapine, \nparoxetine.\n.\n# Hyperlipidemia: Continued on home lipitor.\n.\n# FEN: Electrolytes were monitored closely. K+ and Ca+ were \nrepleted.\n.\n# Nutrition: He was initially made NPO, then liquids were \nstarted and his diet was gradually advanced.  On discharge, he \nwas eating a renal diet without problems.\n.\n# Prophylaxis:  He was maintained on SC UF Heparin for DVT proph \nand a PPI for stress ulcer proph.\n.\n# Code status: Full code\n\n \nMedications on Admission:\nMedications:\nGabapentin 300mg one qAM, two qHS\nMirtazapine 30mg qHS\nPantoprazole 40mg daily\nCalcitriol 0.5mcg qod\nRenagel 1600mg TID with meals\nParoxetine 20mg daily\nZolpidem 10mg qHS\nASA 325mg daily\nFerrous Sulfate 325mg daily\nAcidophilus 10mg daily\nLipitor 10mg daily\nSensipar 60mg daily\nMethadone 10mg q4h\nOxycodone 10mg q4h\n \nDischarge Medications:\n1.

A bacterial infection was found in your abdominal cavity, that was likely introduced through your peritoneal dialysis catheter. The bacteria had also spread to your blood, likely contributing to your low blood pressure. You had two lines placed, in your left neck and right forearm, and antibiotics were delivered. You had frequent peritoneal dialysis in order to wash out the infected fluid. Beginning on your third hospital day, you began receiving antibiotics into your abdominal cavity rather than directly into your blood vessels.

Large late subacute intraparenchymal hemorrhage within the \nright occipital and posterior temporal lobes, with partial \neffacement of the occipital horn of the right lateral ventricle, \nbut no shift of midline structures or mass effect on basal \ncisterns. \n2. Encephalomalacia in the posterior right occipital lobe likely \nrepresents the surgical cavity.  Surrounding T2 hyperintensity \nextending to the atrium of the right lateral ventricle, without \nprior MRI for comparison.  No nodular enhancement is identified. \n\n3. Please note that the inferior portions of the cerebellar \nhemispheres are not adequately imaged.\n\nEEG ___:\nThis is an abnormal continuous EEG monitoring study because of \neight electrographic seizures originating in the right \ncentral\/parasagittal region lasting ___ minutes. Clinically, \nthe patient is able to converse at the beginning of these events \nhowever he becomes progressively more tremulous with difficulty \ncommunicating as the event progresses. After the sharply \ncontoured rhythmic activity ceases, there is relatively rapid \nreturn of baseline and he is able to converse and perform \nroutine activities such as eating. The background is mildly \ndisorganized suggesting a mild encephalopathy. This is a \nnonspecific finding with regards to etiology but can be seen in \nthe setting of toxic\/metabolic derangements, anoxia, medication \naffect. There is diffuse overriding fast activity which is \ntypically seen in the setting of medication affect, i.e. \nbenzodiazepines and barbiturates. \nThere are multiple pushbutton activation for patient \ntremulousness or \ndifficulty moving his upper extremities which are associated \nwith \nelectrographic seizures. After the patient receives IV \nlorazepam, there is \nimprovement in the background and no further discrete \nelectrographic seizures. \nHowever there continue to be periods of rhythmic slowing lasting \nseconds at a time while the patient appears to be sleeping. \n\nEEG ___:\nThis is an abnormal continuous EEG monitoring study because of \nfocal slowing most prominent over the right parasagittal region \nconsistent \nwith the area of cerebral dysfunction in this region. There are \nalso bursts of focal slowing over the right hemisphere \nconsistent with subcortical or deep midline dysfunction. There \nis a mildly disorganized background consistent with a mild \nencephalopathy. This is a nonspecific finding with regards to \netiology but can be seen in the setting of toxic\/metabolic \nderangements, anoxia, and medication effect. There is diffuse \noverriding fast activity which is typically seen in the setting \nof medications, i.e. benzodiazepines and barbiturates. There are \nmultiple pushbutton activations for decreased responsiveness or \npatient tremulousness, which are at times associated with delta \nslowing most prominent over the right posterior quadrant. When \ncompared to the previous day's study, there are no further \nelectrographic seizures, which is an overall improvement. \n\nEEG ___:\nThis is an abnormal continuous EEG monitoring study because of \nfocal slowing most prominent over the right parasagittal region \nconsistent \nwith the area of cerebral dysfunction in this region. There are \nalso bursts of focal slowing over the right hemisphere \nconsistent with subcortical or deep midline dysfunction. There \nis a disorganized background consistent with a mild-moderate \nencephalopathy. This is a nonspecific finding with regards to \netiology but can be seen in the setting of toxic\/metabolic \nderangements, anoxia, and medication effect. There is diffuse \noverriding fast activity which is typically seen in the setting \nof medications, i.e. benzodiazepines and barbiturates. There are \nmultiple pushbutton activations for decreased responsiveness or \npatient tremulousness, which are at times associated with delta \nslowing most prominent over the right posterior quadrant, \nhowever this slowing is also present at other times when the \nbutton is not pressed. \nCompared to the previous day's study, there are prolonged \nperiods with \nprominent delta slowing which is an overall worsening. \n\nCHEST X-RAY ___\nThere are low lung volumes.  This causes crowding the \nbronchovascular markings\nand exaggeration of heart size.  The study is compromised \nsecondary to patient\npositioning.\n \nThe heart is not enlarged.

He was initially on the neurology service \nuntil his seizures were controlled then transferred to the \noncology service where the decision was made to resume \noutpatient radiation. \n\nACUTE ISSUES\n=======================\n#Seizures\nKeppra had been recently increased to 1000 mg BID prior to \nadmission. It was further increased to 1500mg BID upon \nadmission. During the first day of admission, the patient had 8 \nelectro clinical seizures arising from deep midline with \ngeneralization bilaterally. He has given lacosamide 200 mg IV \nload, and continued on 200mg BID. The second day of admission, \nthe patient continued to have clinical events, but no longer had \nEEG correlate. As the semiology was very similar, it was felt \nthat these were epileptic seizures with a deep seizure focus \nthat is difficult to capture on EEG. The seizures are \ncharacterized by suddenly decreased responsiveness with arm \ntremor with nonspecific reaching or picking movements in either \narm. He is intermittently responsive to simple yes\/no questions \nand intermittently follows simple commands with delay during the \nseizures. The event ends with slowly improving mental status, \nand it is difficult to tell when the seizure ends vs postictal \nstate. The patient was loaded with phenytoin on ___, and had \ndecreased episodes of paroxysmal poor responsiveness. However, \nhe became more encephalopathic, and phenytoin was discontinued \non ___. He continued on keppra and lacosamide without further \nclinical seizures between ___ - ___. Patient pulled off his EEG \nleads but clinically improved therefore was kept of EEG \nmonitoring. \n\n#Encephalopathy:\nBy ___, he became more encephalopathic and agitated. He had been \nconversant and appropriate on ___. CT ___ was obtained which \nwas stable. Evaluation for infectious etiology was negative with \nblood and urine cultures. Patient had a mild leukocytosis on ___ \nthat downtrended thereafter and was not febrile. His mental \nstatus change was attributed to multiple AEDs, mild \nbenzodiazepine withdrawal (patient refusing home PO doses), and \nhospital acquired delirium. Given urgency of radiation planning, \npatient was given 5mg zyprexa IM BID to help him stay calm \nduring procedures. Home Ativan was converted to IV Ativan (1.5mg \nq6hours) to avoid benzodiazepine withdrawal, as patient \notherwise often refused PO medications. His mental status \nimproved throughout the admission and was able to tolerate PO \nmedications. \n\n#Tachycardia:\nOn the day of discharge patient was working with occupational \ntherapy he became tachycardic to 139 with standing and walking. \nEKG showed sinus tachycardia. He received 500cc bolus with \nresolution of his orthostatic tachycardia and his heart rates \nwere in the ___ with ambulation. \n\n# Gliosarcoma\nMRI showed significant edema in R posterior temporal lobe that \nwas stable. A small area of bleeding was stable, and per family \nhad been present postoperatively. Neuro-oncology was consulted \nduring admission. Radiation oncology was involved to consider \ntransfer radiation plan to ___ but plan was made to \nresume his outpatient radiation at ___ \nsince it was closer to home. Patient underwent CT mapping with \nradiation oncology on ___ and was transferred to the oncology \nservice for further management. He was continued on \ndexamethasone 4mg q8 hours and temazolamide was resumed when he \nwas taking PO at 140mg qdaily.\n\nCHRONIC ISSUES\n=====================\n# Hypertension\nPatient was continued on home antihypertensives. Losartan was \nadded for anti-inflammatory benefit. He had elevated blood \npressures to 140-150s systolic while agitated.\n\n# Hyperlipidemia\n# CAD s\/p CABG\nPatient was on rosuvastatin at home. Statin was switched to \npravastatin which has some anti-inflammatory benefit. Patient \nhas been off aspirin since initial presentation for gliosarcoma \ndue to concern for worsening hemorrhage.\n\n==================\nMEDICATION CHANGES\n==================\n-Keppra dose increased from 1000 mg twice a day to 1500 mg twice \na day due to recurrent seizures on lower dose.\n-Started on lacosamide 200 mg twice a day for control of \nrecurrent seizures.\n-Losartan 25 mg daily was started in the neuro ICU for blood \npressure control and anti-inflammatory benefits.\n-Home rosuvastatin was changed to pravastatin 20 mg nightly as \npravastatin is thought to have added anti-inflammatory benefits.\n-Patient discharged on home Bactrim as prophylaxis for steroids. \nAdditionally, omeprazole 20 mg daily was started for GI ppx. \n-Patient given script for nicotine patch at discharge. \n\n===================\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES\n===================\n[] Gliosarcoma: Plan to resume radiation at ___ \n___ on ___. \n[] Mild anemia at the time of discharge (___), likely due to \nphlebotomy. Please follow-up at next appointment. \n[] Patient discharged with home ___, OT, and ___ for \nrehabilitation and medication management.\n[] Patient should not be alone walking outside as he is a high \nfall risk. \n[] Due to seizures, patient should not drive for 6 months or \nuntil cleared by MD. \n\n#HCP\/CONTACT: \nName of health care proxy: ___ \nRelationship: Wife \nPhone: ___\n#CODE STATUS: Full confirmed\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

Had a history of C. \ndiff in ___, which was treated with PO flagyl. During this \nhospitalization, C. diff was positive again, and he was started \non 125 mg PO vancomycin. He did not have fevers or leukocytosis \nat this time or during the hospitalization, but did have a \nmarkedly low albumin of 1.6. Stool cultures for salmonella, \nshigella, campylobacter as well as stool ova and parasites \nunrevealing. After 6 days on vancomycin, patient's symptoms had \nnot improved. Vancomycin was increased to 500 mg PO to treat \nsevere C. diff. GI performed a colonoscopy, which did not \ndemonstrate evidence of colitis. Biopsies were taken at this \ntime and revealed normal colonic mucosa. At the time of \ndischarge, patient was still having frequent soft\/watery \ndiarrhea despite some improvement on the PO Vancomycin. Etiology \nof diarrhea remains uncertain, as patient's course is atypical \nfor C. diff infection, and current treatment does not appear to \nbe resolving diarrhea. GI recommends MRE vs. CTE in the \noutpatient setting to further determine etiology. \n\n#Recurrent C. Difficile infection \n(see history above) Switched from PO Metronidazole to Vancomycin \nOral Liquid ___ mg PO\/NG QID for 14 day course given this is \nfirst line treatment for recurrent C. diff infection. Initially \nimproved though then continued having loose stools. Vancomycin \nwas increased to 500 mg to treat severe C. diff on ___ for a \ncomplete 14 day course of the higher dosage. Other etiologies \nwill be worked up as an outpatient, including potential \nresistant C.diff.\n\n#Cervical stenosis\nPatient underwent C4-C6 laminectomies on ___. Patient \ntolerated the procedure well. Please see the operative note for \ndetails. The patient had short episodes of hypertension \nintra-operatively and had an estimated blood loss of 200mL, \ntherefore a hemovac drain was left in place. He was placed in a \nsoft collar. He was extubated in the OR and transferred to the \nPACU for recovery. He required a brief administration of \nphenylephrine for hypotension in the PACU, though responded \nappropriately and promptly. He was then transferred to the neuro \nstep-down unit for continued blood pressure monitoring.\nThe patient's neurologic status was monitored throughout his \nhospitalization. On POD#1, his lower extremity weakness was \nslightly improved. His pain was well managed with IV+PO and then \nonly PO pain regimen. His lower extremity weakness continued to \nimprove during his hospitalization. His hemovac drain was \nremoved at the bedside on POD#2. He was transferred to the floor \non POD#2. The patient was transferred to Medicine service on \n___.\n\n#Coccygeal pressure ulcer\npatient was noted to have a small coccygeal pressure ulcer, ~3mm \nin size, shallow, blanching. A mepilex dressing was applied to \nthe ulcer. On POD1 the patient was evaluated by wound care \nnursing specialists who recommended continuing mepilex dressings \nas it was healing well.\n\n#Hypokalemia \nMost likely due to GI losses in the setting of large quantities \nof diarrhea. Additionally, if there is an ongoing malabsorptive \nprocess, oral K may not be adequately absorbed. Potassium \nrepleted aggressively this admission with both IV and PO \npotassium. At the time of discharge, K had stabilized and \npatient was requiring less repletion. \n\n#Macrocytic anemia\nPatient with elevated MCV and anemia this admission. Concern for \nboth\nfolate\/B12 deficiency in the setting of malabsorption though \nboth B12 and folate WNL. Likely related to CKD.\n\n#Atrial tachyarrythmia\nLikely in the setting of CHF with electrolyte disturbance ___ \nCKD and chronic diarrhea. 12-lead EKG difficult to distinguish \nbetween atrial flutter (given rate of 150) vs. supraventricular \ntachycardia. Patient reported palpitations during one episode of \ntachychardia but was otherwise asymptomatic. Given he endorsed \nhistory of heart arrhythmia for many years and was never \nanticoagulated favored to be an atrial tacharcardia. Patient \nstarted on PO metoprolol this admission for rate control. \nElectrolytes repleted aggressively per above. \n\n#S\/p cervical laminectomy \nHemovac drain removed ___. Soft collar applied as needed for \ncomfort. Neurologic exam stable this admission.\n\n#ESRD on dialysis \nESRD due to DM2. S\/p failed transplant ___, now back on HD \n(___) for the past year. Renal following, appreciate recs. \nMaintained on low sodium diet with liberal phosphorous and \npotassium intake given diarrhea \n\nCHRONIC ISSUES:\n===============\n#T2DM\nSC insulin sliding scale while in house.\n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\n====================\n# Appointment with GI on ___. Unclear if patient's C. diff \nis primary etiology of chronic diarrhea. Colonoscopy performed \nthis hospitalization showed no obvious colitis. Will likely need \nfurther workup with MRE vs. CTE in the outpatient setting.\n\n# Monitor potassium at HD, may need higher potassium baths if \nlosing lots of K in stools.\n\n# Please continue to hold phosphate binder as he has regularly \nrequired phosphate supplementation this admission.\n\n# Consider trial of fidaxomicin if continues to have refractory \nsymptoms of diarrhea despite PO Vancomycin treatment. \n\nNEW MEDICATIONS:\nVancomycin Oral Liquid ___ mg PO\/NG QID- ___1 ___ \nD14 ___ \nMetoprolol Succinate 50 mg PO\/NG QD \nCinacalcet 60 mg PO DAILY\nCholeystyramine as adjuvant treating C. diff\n\nCHANGED MEDICATIONS: None \n\nHELD MEDICATIONS: None \n\n# CODE STATUS: DNR\/DNI\n# CONTACT: ___ \n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

The right atrium is markedly \ndilated. The estimated right atrial pressure is ___. Left \nventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular \ncavity size is normal. The left ventricular ejection fraction is \nmoderately depressed (35%) secondary to mechanical dyssynchrony \nas well as right ventricular-centric septal motion. There is no \nleft ventricular outflow obstruction at rest or with Valsalva. \nThe right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. The right \nventricular cavity is markedly dilated with severe global free \nwall hypokinesis. There is abnormal septal motion\/position \nconsistent with right ventricular pressure\/volume overload as \nwell as pacing-induced dyssynchrony. The aortic valve leaflets \nare moderately thickened. Significant aortic stenosis is present \n(not quantified; however, the reduction od aortic valve orifice \narea is severe and probably represents low flow\/low gradient \naortic stenosis). The mitral valve leaflets are mildly \nthickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. An eccentric, \nposteriorly directed jet of moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation \nis seen. Due to the eccentric nature of the regurgitant jet, its \nseverity may be significantly underestimated (Coanda effect). \nThe tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Severe [4+] \ntricuspid regurgitation is seen. [In the setting of at least \nmoderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, the estimated \npulmonary artery systolic pressure may be underestimated due to \na very high right atrial pressure.] The main pulmonary artery is \ndilated. The branch pulmonary arteries are dilated. There is no \npericardial effusion.\n.\nCompared with the findings of the prior report (images \nunavailable for review) of ___, the mitral and \ntricuspid regurgitation are increased, biventricular antegrade \nstroke volume is markedly reduced, and the low flow\/low gradient \nnature of the aortic stenosis is now evident. The right \nventricle is now significantly more dilated and hypocontractile. \n \n................................................\nCARDIAC CATHETERIZATION ___\nTechnical\nAnesthesia: Local\nSpecimens: none\nRHC via RFV, 7 ___ PWP\n.\nBlood Oximetry Information\nBaseline\nTimeSiteHgb (gm\/dL)Sat (%)\n10:02AMPA      10.10          50\n10:22AMART     10.10          93\n.\n100% O2\nTimeSiteHgb (gm\/dL)Sat (%)\n10:33AMART     10.10          100\n10:38AMPA      10.10          62\n10:44AMRA      10.10          67\n.\nCardiac Output Results\nPhase     C.O.

Left ventricular \nwall thickness, cavity size and regional\/global systolic \nfunction are normal (LVEF 60-70%). There is no ventricular \nseptal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall \nmotion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear \nstructurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic \nregurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with \ntrivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. \nThere is no pericardial effusion.  \n.\n___ U\/S (___): Unremarkable right upper quadrant ultrasound\n.\nCTA Chest (___):  No pulmonary embolism or acute \ncardiopulmonary process. Mediastinal, hilar, axillary and portal \nlymphadenopathy suspicious for lymphoma. \n.\nR axillary LN biopsy (___): Tissue sections are of multiple \nfragments of nodal tissue with paracortical expansion. Scattered \nreactive appearing germinal centers, including some \ngeographically enlarged ones are noted.  In the expanded \ninterfollicular paracortical region, there are background areas \nof sclerosis, increased vascularity, as well as scattered mixed \ninflammatory cells including few plasma cells and eosinophils. \nOccasional scattered immunoblasts are also seen, however no \ndiagnostic ___ cells are seen. There are focal areas \nof karyorrhectic debris also noted. Several collections of \npigment-laden macrophages (tatoo-ink) are noted.  Occasional \nill-formed granulomas are also seen.  By immunohistochemistry, \nCD20 appropriately highlights B cell follicles, as well as \nscattered interfollicular cells, including some larger \nimmunoblasts.  T-cell markers (CD3, CD5, CD2, CD7) appropriately \nhighlight T-zones; T-cells are CD4 predominant (CD4 to CD8 ratio \nis approximately 5:1).  CD30 highlights scattered large cells \nresembling immunoblasts. CD68 highlights scattered histiocytes, \nwith no large clusters seen. CD123 highlights occasional small \nclusters of perivascular plasmacytoid dendritic cells.  By MIB-1 \nstaining, the proliferation fraction is 10%-20% overall, and 90% \nin germinal centers.  ___ highlights follicular dendritic \nmeshworks that are largely confined to germinal centers.  \nSpecial stains for fungal and acid fast organisms (GMS, AFB) are \nnegative with adequate controls.  In situ hybridization studies \nfor ___ Virus encoded RNA (___) are negative.\n.\nMediastinal LN biopsy (___):  Non-specific T cell dominant \nlymphoid profile;  diagnostic immunophenotypic features of \ninvolvement by non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma are not seen in \nspecimen.  Correlation with clinical findings and morphology \n(see ___ is recommended.  Flow cytometry \nimmunophenotyping may not detect all lymphomas due to \ntopography, sampling or artifacts of sample preparation.\n.\nCXR (___): New right lower lobe consolidation and posterior \neffusion. Followup is recommended to assess for progression of \nsome change in left lower lobe as well. \n\n.\nCXR (___):  In comparison with study of ___, there is \nprogressive decrease in the bibasilar opacifications. Some \napparent residual fibrotic streaks or atelectasis are seen, \nespecially at the right base.  The prominence of the right \nparatracheal and azygos region is substantially \nless than on the previous examination. Subclavian catheter \nremains in place.  \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ year old  M chronic RLE wound infection following a ___ \nfracture sustained from a MVA in ___ on daptomycin now admitted \nwith shortness of breath, feeling unwell, abnormal LFTs and \nmediastinal & hilar lymphadenopathy noted on chest CT. \n\n#. Hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy\/Night sweats:  The \npatient was found to have diffuse LAD per Chest CT. It was \nthought that the LAD was most likely from lymphoma vs. reactive, \nbut ID was also consulted. Pt was ruled out for HIV, Hep A,B,C, \nviral infection, Ehrlichia, Coccido, EBV, CMV, Histoplasmosis, \nand TB.  The patient had an axillary biopsy, which was found to \nbe reactive.  Since lymphoma was still very high on the \ndifferential, a mediastinal biopsy was performed to identify an \netiology.  This returned as non-caseating granulomas, which was \npossibly consistent with an occupational exposure.  The patient \nwas encouraged to follow up with the pulmonology department \nregarding this finding, and he was stable upon discharge.\n.\n#. Elevated Liver Enzymes:  On admission, the patient was found \nto have elevated liver enzymes.  It was thought that the patient \nmay have autoimmune hepatitis, but his ___ and anti-sm were both \nnegative.  ___ U\/S and Abdominal CT were also both within normal \nlimits.  It was then thought that the patient's transaminitis \nmay be secondary to a drug reaction.  The patient was switched \nfrom daptomycin to linezolid for his chronic osteomyelitis, and \nhis liver enzymes normalized.  \n.\n#. R axillary hematoma:  The patient was found to have swelling \nand severe pain at the right axilly LN bx site after his biopsy. \nThe area was not erythematous and there was not notable exudate. \nSurgery examined the patient and stated that there was a seroma \nin the area, which would resolve on its own without \nintervention. \n.\n#. Hospital Acquired Pneuonia:  During this admission, the \npatient developed a leukocytosis, fevers, and a productive \ncough.  This occurred shortly after his mediastianal lymph node \nbiopsy.  A CXR was performed, which showed a new infiltrate at \nthe right lower lobe.  The patient was placed on O2, and he was \nstarted on Cefepime.  The patient's sputum did not grow any \norganims, so the patient was continued on a 10-day course of \nCefepime.  A repeat CXR seven days later showed interval \nimprovement in his pneumonia.  \n.\n#. MRSA Osteomyelitis:  Patient has a chronic osteomyelitis of \nhis R distal tibia.  He had been admitted on daptomycin for this \ninfection, but this was switched to Linezolid given his elevated \nliver enzymes.  The patient was eventually switched to Bactrim, \nwhich he should continue for a prolonged course after discharge. \n The patient will follow up with the orthopedic surgeons and the \ninfectious disease department regarding this condition.  \n.\n#. Depression:  The patient was experiencing severe depression \ngiven his prolonged hospital course with multiple complications \nover the past year.  He was started on Remeron this admission, \nwhich was titrated up to 30mg daily.  The patient was also seen \nby Social Work during this admission.  The patient did not \nexpress suicidal or homicidal ideation, and he did not have any \nacute events during this admission.  \n.\n#.

ST-T wave \nchanges in the inferolateral leads consistent with probable \nischemia. Compared to the previous tracing of ___ the \nfindings are similar. \n.\nCTA chest  (___):\nIMPRESSION:    \nRight lower lobe pleural-based lung mass with multiple bilateral \npulmonary nodules, one of which appears partially calcified. \nThere is also bilateral hilar and mediastinal adenopathy. \nFindings are concerning for primary lung neoplasm versus pleural \n\/ parenchymal based metastases. One of the nodules appears \npartly calcified and metastases from osteosarcoma or squamous \ncell primary should be considered. Further staging with CT \nabdomen and pelvis and\/or CT\/PET is recommended. No evidence for \npulmonary embolism or aortic dissection to account for chest \npain.  \n.\nECHO (___): \nThe left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left \nventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is \nnormal. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic \ndysfunction with inferior and infero-lateral hypokinesis. There \nis no ventricular septal defect.

Mild to moderate (___) mitral \nregurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly \nthickened. There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic \nhypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. \n.\nCardiac Cath (___):\nCOMMENTS:      \n1. Coronary angiography in this left dominant system revealed \ntwo vessel \ndisease. The LMCA was without angiographically apparent disease. \nThe LAD \nhad no significant disease. The LCx had 40% proximal stenosis \nand was \n100% occluded in the mid vessel. The RCA was non-dominant with \nmild \ndiffuse disease. \n2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed systemic arterial \nnormotension. \nFINAL DIAGNOSIS:     \n1. Two vessel coronary artery disease. \n2. Inferolateral STEMI with occluded mid LCx. \n3. Plavis 75 mg daily mandatory for 4 weeks, 3 months better, \nand 12 \nmonths best. \n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ yo M with several cardiac risk factors -smoking, age, but no \nknown CAD, presents with NSTEMI.\n.  \n# NSTEMI: Mr. ___ presented to the p\/w atypical chest pressure \nin the setting of emesis from excess ETOH consumption. On \npresentation to the ED, the plan was two sets of troponins and a \nstress test. His initial troponin was < .01. However, his second \ntroponin increased to 1.46. His EKG had no signs of ST \nelevations, but there were areas in the inferior-lateral leads \nthat were concerning for possible ischemia. He had a stool \nguaiac in the ED and was started on a heparin gtt. He was \ntransferred to the floor where he had no complaints of chest \npain. He was continued on a heparin gtt. He was started on \naspirin and loaded with plavix 600mg. His SBP remained low \nduring his hospital stay. We discontinued his home dose of \natenolol and switched him to metoprolol tid. However, the \npatient started to develop intermittent bradycardia (see below) \nand we had to decrease the dosing of metoprolol to 25mg bid. We \ndid not start him on a ACE inhibitor, given that his systolic \nblood pressures were in the low 100s. He remained \nhemodynamically stable until his cardiac catheterization on \n___. He was found to have a lesion in the mid-circumflex \nartery. A bare mental stent was placed and restored normal flow \nthrough the artery. He did complain of numbness and tingling in \nthe left arm after the cath. He had repeat EKGs that were \nunchanged from previous EKGs. The patient was ready for \ndischarge on ___. He was informed about the importance of \ncontinuing aspirin and plavix to prevent stenosis of the bare \nmetal stent placed. I discussed the events of his \nhospitalization with his primary care physician. He was \nscheduled for a follow-up with a cardiologist in 1 to 2 weeks \nafter his discharge. \n.  \n# Intermittent bradycardia: Pt. has had several episodes of \nasymptomatic bradycardia. He was alternating between Mobitz type \nI and II on ___. EP was consulted and were concerned that \nhe had a higher degree AV block. They felt that his bradycardia \nwas exacerbated by ischemia and did not feel that a pacemaker \nwas warranted. They felt that the bradycardia should resolve \nonce he had the cath completed. \n.\n# PUMP: no known history of CHF, but had an elevated JVP on \npresentation. The patient had an ECHO completed on ___ that \nrevealed that he had a moderate EF (45%) and hypokinesis in the \ninterior and inferior-lateral walls of the ventricle. He did not \nhave any evidence of heart failure during his hospitalization.\n.  \n# Lung nodules: The patient had a CT chest early in his \nadmission because there was concern that he had a pulmonary \nembolism or an aortic dissection. The CT scan  revealed no \nevidence of aortic dissection or pulmonary embolism. He did have \na 3cm right pleural based nodule w\/ multiple small nodules as \nwell as hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy concerning for \nmalignancy. Radiology recommended an abdominal\/pelvic CT scan or \na PET scan for staging. The CT scan was deferred during his \nhospitalization because he had received multiple dye loads \nwithin 48 hours of each other and there was concern for contrast \nnephropathy. Obviously, the pulmonary nodules were an incidental \nfinding and the patient is aware of the importance of close \nfollow-up to evaluate these nodules. Dr. ___ primary care \nphysician, was informed about the results of the study and a CT \nscan of the abdomen and pelvis was scheduled in 1 week after \ndischarge. \n.  \n# Diabetes: recent HA1c was 6.2. We completed fingersticks four \ntimes a day and had a sliding scale written as needed.  \n.  \n# HTN: His baseline blood pressure usually ranges between 130 to \n140. His SBP was significantly lower during his hospital stay. \nHis systolic blood pressures ranged between 90 and 112. He was \n.  \n# Glaucoma: He was continued on his home regimen of eye drops \n(Cosopt\/Travatan)  \n.  \n# ETOH abuse: The patient has an extensive history of alcohol \nabuse. During his hositalziation, he had no signs of withdrawal. \nHe was written for a CIWA scale and this was discontinued on \n___.    \n.\nPROPHYLAXIS:  \n-DVT ppx with heparin gtt -> SQ heparin after cath.\n-Pain management with tylenol  \n-Bowel regimen with senna\/colace  \n.  \nCODE: FULL  \n.\n \nMedications on Admission:\nASPIRIN - 325 MG TABLET (ENTERIC COATED) daily  \nATENOLOL - 50 mg Tablet - 1 Tablet(s) by mouth at bedtime  \nCYCLOBENZAPRINE - 10 mg Tablet q 8hrs prn  \nDORZOLAMIDE-TIMOLOL [COSOPT] - 0.5 %-2 % Drops - 1 gtt BID  \nIBUPROFEN - 600 mg Tablet - 1 Tablet(s) by mouth three times a  \nday as needed for pain take the medication with food.

Otherwise, unremarkable CT \nexamination of the sinuses. \n\nEEG ___:\nIMPRESSION: Abnormal cEEG because of (1) frequent two to eight \nsecond bursts \nof ___ Hz biparietally predominant generalized spike wave and \nsharp wave \ndischarges, without clear clinical correlate, and without \nevolution or \norganization to suggest that they are electrographic seizures. \nThese are \npresent primarily during the awake state when the patient's eyes \nare closed \nand during drowsiness and are markedly diminished during eyes \nopen wakefulness \nand deeper sleep. There is no clinical correlate to these \nbursts. These are \nindicative of generalized cortical irritability, maximal in the \nposterior \nregions; (2) significant intermixed theta activity in the awake \nstate \nconsistent with a mild encephalopathy. In comparison to the \nprior EEG from \n___ and to the prior cEEG study from ___, there are no \nsignificant changes. \n\nEEG ___:\nIMPRESSION: Abnormal cEEG because of (1) an unusual pattern \ndefined by \nfrequent intermittent two to eight second bursts of ___ Hz \ngeneralized, \nbifrontocentrally predominant rhythmic delta activity with \nsuperimposed \ncentroparietally predominant spikes as well as superimposed \nfrontocentrally \npredominant fast polyspike activity. These bursts are present \nprimarily \nduring the awake eyes closed state and during drowsiness and are \nmarkedly \ndiminished to almost completely absent during eyes open \nwakefulness and deeper \nsleep. There is no clinical correlate to these bursts. While the \npresence of \ngeneralized spikes would typically indicate generalized cortical \nirritability, \nthe significance of this specific more complex pattern is \nunclear; (2) \nisolated generalized parietally predominant spikes and frontally \npredominant \npolyspikes during sleep indicative of generalized cortical \nirritability; (3) \nsignificant intermixed theta activity in the awake state \nconsistent with a \nmild encephalopathy. In comparison to the prior day's study, the \nbursts are \nless frequent than on the prior day, particularly in the \nafternoon. \n\nMRI Head W and W\/out contrast ___:\nInterval worsening of diffuse pachymeningeal thickening and \nenhancement, and bilateral uncal herniation with associated \ndeformity of the midbrain.  Again, these findings may reflect \nintracranial hypotension, related to occult \"CSF leak.\" \n\nCT Abd\/Pelvis ___:\n1.  No evidence of intrapelvic or intra-abdominal malignant \ndisease. \n2. 3.7 x 2.7 cm left paraovarian lesion, which is slightly \nenlarged from the prior exam.  However, pelvic ultrasound is \nrecommended for further evaluation and characterization. \n\nCT Chest ___:\nNo evidence of intrathoracic malignancy. \n  \nMild bilateral axillary adenopathy improved since ___. \nNo \nintrathoracic lymph node enlargement. \n  \nRight periscapular bursal cyst does not require further \nevaluation unless the \npatient is symptomatic. \n\nMRI C,T,L-Spine ___:\n1. Interval worsening of previously noted dural thickening and \nenhancement \nwhich now extends intermittently down the length of the spine. \n  \n2. No interval change in large perineural cysts in the thoracic \nspine and \nmultiple Tarlov cysts. No findings to suggest CSF leak. \n  \n3.

Work up revealed evidence of \npachymeningitis of unclear cause and frequent electrographic \nseizures without clinical correlate. Seizures were controlled \nwith 4 AEDs and an empriric course of systemic steroids provided \nimprovement in the patient's mental status. \n\nOver the past month or so the patient has begun to have frequent \nperiods of nodding off and urinary incontinence. There was \nconcern for either medication toxicity or intermittent seizures \nand she was admitted for repeat imaging of the brain, continuous \nvideo EEG monitoring and possible titration of her AEDs. She was \nfound to have a UTI and is completed a course of antibiotics. \nHer symptoms of incontinence have resolved and her sleepiness is \nimproving.\n\n# CHRONIC UNCAL HERNIATION \/ PACHYMENINGITIS: Appears worse on \nrepeat MRI compared with prior. On exam she continues to be \nalert. She does have some cognitive deficits (can only name 5 \nwords that start with the letter \"s\" in 1 min). The etiology of \nher uncal herniation could be either secondary to increased \nintracranial pressure or low CSF pressure in the spine from an \noccult CSF leak. Fundoscopic exam did not reveal papilledema. \nThe pain service was consulted with a question of empiric blood \npatch but ultimately the procedure was deemed to risky because \nan accidental puncture of the dura could be fatal in the setting \nof increased intracranial pressure. Her workup for an etiology \nof her pachymeningitis including imaging to look for CSF leak, \nmalignancy workup, and rheumatologic workup was repeated and \nunrevealing. Concerns regarding her safety at home were raised \nand a family meeting was held to arrange a safe discharge plan. \n\n# SEIZURES: In the setting of chronic pachymeningitis and uncal \nherniation Ms. ___ has abnormal EEG findings. Although \nabnormal at baseline, her EEG did not show new abnormalities. \nShe was discharged on Keppra XR ___ daily, phenytoin BID, \nZonisamide 400mg qhs. She also continued primidone, folate, and \nher multivitamin. Her Seroquel was held in the setting of \nincreased sleepiness. \n\n# URINARY TRACT INFECTION: UA and urine culture revealed a \nurinary tract infection and she was treated for an uncomplicated \nUTI with 3 days of ceftriaxone. Likely this was the etiology of \nthe urinary incontinence and possibly waxing and waning mental \nstatus, both of which improved with treatment of her UTI.\n\n# PRURUTIS: Ms. ___ has chronic itching with a questionable \nhistory of scabies last hospitalization for which she was \nempirically treated. She had no rash on exam. Dermatology was \nconsulted and felt her itching is not consistent with scabies. \nIt improved with topical creams including Vaseline and sarna. \nSystemic illness including Hepatitis B and abnormal liver \nfunction were ruled out as well. \n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES\n- follow up in neurology clinic\n- elder services is following her outpatient regarding a safe \nhome plan\n- PET scan outpatient to rule out occult malignancy\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

Orthostatic hypotension: Pt found to be orthostatic. \nDifferential: volume depletion from combination of diovan and \nlasix, autonomic nueropathy, adrenal insuficiency (hypoglycemia, \nweakness, K+ on the high side of normal, abs eos #=400-500). Pt \nwas given several liters of IVF in the ED and still mildly \northostatic. Adrenal insuficiency was considered in setting of \nhypoglycemia, muscle weakness, K+ on the high end of normal, \nmild eosinophilia (abs eos=400-500). Morning cortisol was 3.3 \nand cosyntropin test bumped cortisol up to 28, 2 hrs later. ACTH \nstill pending. Given the normal results of this cosyntropin \ntest, it is unlikely that pt has primary adrenal insuficiency. \nHowever, secondary adrenal insuficiency still possible (although \nunlikely), pending ACTH results. Autonomic neuropathy was \nconsidered in pt with long standing diabetes and end organ \ninvolvement. However, EKG did reveal respiratory variation of RR \ninterval making this diagnosis less likely. Additionally, pt not \ntachycardic, which  is often seen in pts with autonomic \nneuropathy.\n-Pending ACTH results from ___ and ___\n.  \n#. Type 1 Diabetes\/Hypoglycemia: Last hemoglobin a1c 12.8. \nPatient reports episodes of am hypoglycemia last ___ weeks. \nHypoglycemia may be related to adrenal insufficiency. It is also \npossible that pt has antibodies to insulin (from being exposed \nto non-purified insulin several decades ago), causing the NPH to \nstay in her system longer (taking longer to clear), resulting in \nhypoglycemia. This, combined with recent poor PO intake, likely \ncontributed to her symptoms. Additionally, pt has limited Cr \nclearance, likely impairing secretion of insulin and \nsubsequently increasing basal rates. It is also possible that pt \nis not giving herself the accurate amount of insulin since she \nhas poor eye-sight. ___ followed pt during admission. Pt was \ngiven NPH 45U in the AM and will continue this regimen at home. \n(Her home prior regimen was NPH 60U in AM and 20 U in ___  \n.  \n#. Proximal muscle weakness: Pt reports proximal muscle \nweakness, however, she is ___ throughout on neuro exam. CK, TSH, \nLFTs, cortisol syntropin test all wnl. ESR 28 but normal CRP. Pt \ndenies jaw claudication or temporal headaches. Muscle weakness \nlikely ___ hypoglycemia.  Pt's insulin regimen was adjusted \ninhouse.\n.\n# Fall: Pt fell on ambulation from the bathroom to her bed. Fall \nwas secondary to poor eye site. Pt fell on her buttocks. Pt had \nno head trauma, no LOC. She did have some tenderness along \nligaments and muscles of spine. Pt told that this was likely \nmusculoskelet and not a fracture, and she was offered an X-ray \nbut pt declined. Pt had full range of motion. Pt was given \noxycodone and baclofen for pain and discomfort.\n.  \n#. UA positive for trace leuks: urine culture negative.  \n.  \n#. HTN: Initialy held lasix and diovan in setting of \northostasis. Both medicatiosn were reintroduced at lower \ndosages. She was given lasix 80mg every other day and diovan \n80mg daily.  \n.  \n#. Hypercholesterolemia: Continued statin and zetia  \n.  \n#. Glaucoma: Continued eye drops  \n.  \n#. Vitamin D\/B12 deficiency: Continue B12\/D  \n\nPENDING LABS:\n-ACTH from ___ and ___\n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\n-Full code\n-reccomend pt continue to get workup for her symptoms of \nhypoglycemia, weakness. ACTH results still pending. Pt might \nbenefit from repeat co-syntropin test and from checking \naldosterone. She had adequate response to co-syntropin, however \nmorning cortisol was low at 3.\n-Hypoglycemia: reccomend pt ultimately be switched to glargine \nfor long acting control. Pt declined during this \nhospitalization. Also reccomended that she start using the \ninsulin pen given her poor vision. Pt will follow up with \nendocrinologist.\n\n \nMedications on Admission:\n___ year old woman with longstanding Type 1 DM c\/b nephropathy, \nneuropathy, gastroparesis, and retinopathy here with labile \nblood sugars and ortostatic hypotension.  \n.  \n#. Orthostatic hypotension: Pt found to be orthostatic in the \nED. Differential: volume depletion from combo of diovan and \nlasix, autonomic nueropathy, adrenal insuficiency (hypoglycemia, \nweakness, K+ on the high side of normal, abs eos #=400-500). \nNormal electrolytes, especially normal sodium and lack of \nongoing hypotension, fever, abdominal pain argue against acute \nadrenal insufficiency. However, chronic primary or secondary \nadrenal insufficiency is possible given morning hypoglycemia, \nfatigue, and proximal muscle weakness.  \n- final results ___ stim test. It appears that cortisol: \n3.3-->29, but checking with lab since the timing of studies \nmight have been off.  \n- repeat orthostatics this AM  \n- ___ consult  \n- re-start lasix (80 every other day, per pt) and diovan (80) \nfor now  \n- If this is autonomic neuropathy and pt is disabled with \northostasis, would consider midodrine or fludrocortisone which \nwould likely exacerbate fluid retention if no improvement  \n- compression stockings  \n.  \n#. Type 1 Diabetes\/Hypoglycemia: Last hemoglobin a1c 12.8. \nPatient reports recent episodes of am hypoglycemia last ___ \nweeks. She recently had ED visit for hyperglycemia on ___ but \nstates this was secondary to attempts to increase PO intake \ngiven low am blood sugars. Hypoglycemia may be related to \nadrenal insufficiency and\/or hypoglycemia associated autonomic \nfailure or insulin excess.  \n- QID fingersticks with no bedtime coverage  \n- continue NPH 45 units qam per recent adjustment (home regimen: \n60 AM and 20 ___  \n.  \n#. Proximal muscle weakness: Pt reports proximal muscle \nweakness, however, she is ___ throughout on neuro exam. \nDifferential dx includes adrenal insufficiency or other \nendocrinopathy such as hypo\/hyperthroidism or deconditioning or \npolymyositis.  \n- check TSH, CK, LFTs, cortisol  \n- ___ consult  \n.  \n#. UA positive for trace leuks: Follow up urine cx, pt without \nurinary symptoms.  \n.  \n#. CRI: Cr 1.2 at baseline.  \n.  \n#. HTN: BP 160-170s overnight. Currently hypertensive while \nsupine but remains orthostatic.  \n- Hold lasix  \n- hold diovan for now but will likely need decreased dose of \ndiovan for renal protection and will order as 80mg prn SBP>180  \n-prior home regimen: lasix 80 every other day, diovan 200 and \n160 alternating days->160 daily. Will hold both for now in \nsetting of orthostatic hypotension in the ED.  \n.  \n#. Nasal congestion: Saline nasal spray prn  \n.  \n#. Hypercholesterolemia: Continue statin and zetia  \n.  \n#.

Renal was consulted given unclear \netiology (FeUrea 55%, US neg, urine eos neg, I\/Os positive \nbalance, no contrast, no documented hypotension, no \nnephrotoxins). They felt it may have been due to relative \nhypotension\/hypoperfusion in setting of sepsis and restarting \nlisinopril and lasix (got his home PO dose lisinopril 5mg and \nlasix 80mg PO on ___ am before labs were drawn).  We held his \nlasix and lisinopril and allowed his BP to be a bit higher to \nmaintain perfusion. His creat improved on his own. Given that \nhis O2 sats were good, we did not resume his lasix on discharge \nand this can be done over the next few days per Dr. ___ his \ncreat remains stable. We also did not resume his lisinopril and \nthis can be resumed after a week or so if BP and creat are good \nafter resuming lasix. He does tend to have hypoK\/Mag, even when \nhe was not getting lasix and this can be monitored.  His \nfamily\/wife updated on daily  basis.

Punctate focus of questionable restricted diffusion in the \nsuperior medial left thalamus, which may represent an acute \ninfarction versus artifact. Otherwise, no new large acute \ninfarct or mass effect. \n\nCarotid ultrasounds ___:\nIMPRESSION:  \n1.  Patent left ICA stent.  Mild homogeneous plaque in the left \nICA results in less than 40% stenosis.   \n2.  No right-sided carotid vasculature atherosclerotic disease. \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nPlease see previous discharge summary for details.\n\nIn summary, Mr. ___ returned for another recurrent episode of \naphasia\/dysarthria. An MRI showed a left thalamic infarct which \nwas new in the interim since prior admission, in addition to the \nknown left splenium infarct. This was also not felt to be \nexplaining his symptoms and felt to be an indication of ongoing \nthrombogenic physiology. Etiology of these recurrent \nTIAs\/strokes remained unknown. Coumadin was stopped as it was \nfelt to not be of additional utility. Platelet function and \nclopidogrel test was sent and suggested some degree of \nclopidogrel resistance. Per agreement with Vascular surgery and \nVascular medicine, decision was made to stop the clopidogrel and \nstart a trial of ticagrelor instead. A repeat swallow evaluation \nwas also performed to exclude risk of aspiration in setting of \npharyngeal\/laryngeal fibrosis from previous radiation therapy. \nTEE was attempted at the recommendation of Vascular medicine, \nhowever it was unsuccessful due to inability to pass probe \nthrough his oropharynx due to fibrosis- no further attempts were \nmade. He was fitted with a Zio patch cardiac monitor in attempt \nto capture any occult arrhythmia as a source of cardioemboli.\n\nAside from stopping Coumadin and clopidogrel, and starting \nticagrelor, no other medication changes were made. His \nneurologic examination at discharge was at baseline.\n\nTransitional issues:\n[ ] Please continue aspirin and ticagrelor indefinitely for \ncarotid artery stent and secondary stroke prevention.\n[ ] Please follow up results of Zio patch cardiac monitoring; if \nany cardiac arrhythmia found we strongly suggest starting \nsystemic anticoagulation (please consult with Stroke provider if \nthis is found).\n[ ] Stroke, Neurosurgery and Vascular Surgery followup arranged.\n[ ] Patient's home antihypertensives were all resumed with \nexception of metoprolol which was halved to 6.25mg BID. Please \ncontinue to monitor and titrate for a long term goal of \nnormotension.\n[ ] Continue atorvastatin for lipid-lowering therapy and obtain \nrepeat LDL in ___ months.

Required brief ICU stay \nfor AMS ___ hypercarbic respiratory failure and upper airway \nstridor, s\/p intubation x 30h, subsequently extubated and \ntransferred to the floor.\n\nACTIVE ISSUES\n==============\n# Acute respiratory failure: Patient presented with shortness of \nbreath with diffuse wheezes and was on home O2 at 2L with \nsubjective SOB due to COPD exacerbation. On admission, he had \nCXR without a consolidative process or fluid accumulation. CTA \nshowed no evidence of PE. On HD #2, patient had episodes of \ndelirium\/AMS with VBG showing hypercarbic respiratory distress \nand was transferred to the MICU where he was noted to have \nstridor. He was intubated for airway protection. ENT evaluated \nthe patient and did not observe any abnormalities on scope. He \nwas then started on ceftriaxone for increased sputum production \nwith GNRs in sputum and area of consolidation in the anterior \nleft upper lobe concerning for PNA. The patient then \nself-extubated after 30 hours and was weaned off down to his \nhome oxygen requirement, so he was transferred out of the ICU to \nthe floor. In the ICU, he received methylpred 60 mg IV q8h from \n___ given the stridor and was subsequently weaned on a \nsteroid taper. His treatment was ultimately azithromycin \n(___), ceftriaxone (___), and prednisone taper \nstarting at 60 mg ___ with 10 mg decrease daily (last dose on \n___. He was discharged on this taper as well as Advair to \nprevent future COPD flares. \n\n# Acute encephalopathy: Patient reported by family to have \nworsening mental status. Appeared in the hospital to correlate \nwith worsening hypercarbia. On ___, he had VBG showing pCO2 to \n80's with academia. However, his baseline pCO2 appears to be in \nhigh 50\/low 60's. He was intubated (see above) and subsequently \nextubated. He received a few doses of SL Zydis overnight after \ntransferred to the floor. Etiology for encephalopathy thought to \nbe a combination of ICU delirium, brief course of high-dose \nsteroids, and infection. His mental status was significantly \nimproved on discharge and is anticipated to resolve slowly after \ndischarge.\n \n# Acute anemia: Patient with Hgb of 9.5 on admission. \nUnfortunately this downtrended to mid-7's during his ICU stay. \nHe was noted in the ICU to have melanotic stool, possibly in the \nsetting of high dose steroids. He has a history of GIB in the \npast. Prior w\/u notable for EGD on ___ that showed 1 cm \nangioectasia BiCAP electrocautery with excellent hemostasis \nsubsequently. Last colonoscopy in ___ showed diverticulosis \nof whole colon and grade 1 internal hemorrhoids. GI was \nconsulted during his hospitalization, who recommended outpatient \nfollow with his current gastroenterologist Dr. ___ as \nnecessary. Etiology likely secondary to AVMs in the setting of \nAS \/ ___ syndrome. Fortunately, he had stable H\/H after \ninitial drop for 5 days at the time of discharge. Hgb at \ndischarge was 7.6. He was continued on iron and B12 \nsupplementation as well as his home PPI BID. \n\n# ___ edema: Patient with history ___ edema. Weight is less on \nadmission than prior discharge but weight loss may be secondary \nto malignancy and poor PO intake. BNP chronically elevated, on \nadmit in 1700s. His home torsemide 20 mg was held due to acute \nillness on discharge and still recovering appetite. He will have \nPCP ___ on ___, at which point he can be reassessed. His \nweight on discharge was 230 lbs. \n\n# CKD: Baseline Cr 1.5. Admit is 1.3. He had some mild ___ \nduring his hospitalization but this resolved back to baseline. \n\n# Gout: Continued home allopurinol\n\n# CAD: \n- Continued ASA, atorvastatin, lisinopril, carvedilol.\n\n# HTN: Poorly controlled in ED and in clinic prior to admission. \nHe was noted to be hypertensive in the ICU but was also on \nhigh-dose steroids, which were contributing. He was continued on \nCoreg, lisinopril. He was also started on amlodipine 5 mg. \n\n# GERD: Continued home pantoprazole and ranitidine\n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES\n===================\n- Started on Advair at discharge. Patient to complete a steroid \ntaper with 30 mg prednisone on ___, then 20 mg on ___, and 10 \nmg on ___.\n- Torsemide 20 mg daily held in the setting of acute illness. \nPlease restart if weight increases >3 lbs over 3 days. Discharge \nweight: 230 lbs.\n- Started on amlodipine 5 mg for hypertension. \n- Hgb was 7.6 on discharge.

Found to be in Afib\/RVR and acute dCHF. Was given a couple \ndoses of IV lasix with rapid improvement, then kept on 40mg PO \nlasix (on 20mg at home) with stable creat, O2 sats, BP. Thought \nis that she has worsening of her chronic dCHF due to Afib rhythm \nand poor HR control. Initally rates were 100-110s, so her \nmetprolol was titrated up from 50mg BID to ___ QID (home on \n200mg bid). Rates still 90-100s, so digoxin added per cardiology \nconsult. Rates now ___ with dig on board and given her CKD, \nshe will be discharged on digoxin 0.125mg QOD. Appears from her \nchart that she was admitted with similar symptoms in ___ (dCHF \nin setting of afib) and spontaneously had converted and had been \nmostly sinus in her outpt follow up visits. Has been on amio as \noutpt per Dr. ___.  Given she is on amio, checked TSH to see \nif this was contributing to her conversion to Afib, and she was \nin fact, found to be hyperthyroid. Her synthroid dose was \nreduced. It was felt in past that she does better in sinus, but \ncardiology aggreed that we unlikley would be able to acheive \nsuccessful cardioversion while she is in hyperthyroid state and \nwe should instead focus on rate control. One concern is that \nonce she flips to NSR, dose of BB is quite high so she was \nwarned about sudden LH or weakness (check pulse). Her INR were \nborderline so her coumadin dose was slightly increased (2mg \n5days a week, 4mg TTh). Her Avapro dose was reduced 300 to 150 \nto allow titration of metoprolol. She did overall very well here \nwith improvement in her resp status. Her chest pain on admission \nwas likely due to acute pulm edema and resolved after diuresis \nand she was ruled out. She had one episode of confusion where \nshe did not know where she was. her vitals\/labs\/UA\/CXR\/CT ___ \nat the time were unremarkable and she improved by next morning. \nShe did well with ___. she will go home where her sister will \ncare for her for a few days and is searching for more around the \nclock care, though pt is otherwise very sharp and independent. \nShe will have CHF ___ and home ___.

No masses or thrombi are seen in the \nleft ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall \nmotion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear \nstructurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic \nstenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears \nstructurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is \nno mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure \ncould not be determined. There is a trivial\/physiologic \npericardial effusion. \n\nIMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with \nregional systolic dysfunction c\/w Takotsubo cardiomyopathy or \nmid-LAD lesion. \n.\nEchocardiogram \n___\n\nThe left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect is seen by \n2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure is ___ \nmmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left \nventricular cavity size is normal. There is moderate regional \nleft ventricular systolic dysfunction with mid to distal \nanterior, distal septal and apical akinesis and distal lateral \nhypokinesis. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left \nventricle. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right \nventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The \naortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic \nstenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The \nmitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral \nvalve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is \na small pericardial effusion. No right ventricular diastolic \ncollapse is seen. There is brief right atrial diastolic \ncollapse. \n\nCompared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, \nthe LVEF has decreased.\n.\nCardiac MR\n___ Pending at time of discharge \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ with no known cardiac history who had witnessed cardiac \narrest, s\/p resuscitation, with concern for LAD lesion, now \ntransferred from ___ ICU to ___ CCU for cardiac \ncatheterization.\n\n1. S\/p cardiac arrest: It was unclear how long pt was down \nbefore compressions started but he was in ventricular \nfibrillation and after being shocked, he returned to sinus tach \nwithin ten minutes.  Pt was not cooled because he was responsive \nand moving around by the time he reached ___.  Also, cooling \nprotocol had not been initiated at OSH and by time he reached BI \nhe was out of the window to start cooling.  On arrival he was \ntubed and sedated.  Pt was loaded with amio.  Over the next ___ \nhours, weaned off vent and pt responded appropriately.  He did \nnot have any other dangerous arrhythmias.  Etiology of vfib was \nmost likely secondary to ischemia.  EKG and Echo were concerned \nof mid-LAD lesion. Initially cardiac cath was performed and \nshowed that there appeared to have been a probable LAD territory \ninfarct\/thrombus that spontaneously resolved with medical \ntherapy.  EP was consulted and performed EP study, placed single \nchambe ICD with no complications.  A CMR was performed and \npreliminarily suggested some scaring but final read is still \npending at time of discharge.  It was rec f\/u with Dr. ___ \n___ from cognitive neurology at time of d\/c. He will need \nrepeat echo ___ wks after d\/c.\n.\nCardiomyopathy: Pt was previously healthy and now with depressed \nLV function with apical hypokinesis.  Most likely secondary to \nischemia, but concern given coronary arteriogram did not show \nany direct evidence occlusion.  Echo pattern was somewhat \nconsistent with takatsubo's.  Pt was started on metoprolol, \nlisinopril and coumadin (apical akinesis) at time of discharge.  \nHe was euvolemic without need for diuresis, so was not started \non lasix on discharge.  \n.\nSTE in lateral leads: Post cath, pt had persistent STE in \nlateral leads and he was asymptomatic.  CE were relatively flat \nwith exception of CK (but pt had rhabdo).  Concern for coronary \nvasospasm, so started on diltiazem drip, but this did not \nresolve to elevations.  Pt was re-cathed, but coronaries were \nclean.  Concern that these elevations are secondary to \nmyocarditis.  Labs were notable for mildly positive rheumatoid \nfactor, negative varicella and EBV.  At time of d\/c ___, viral \ncx and antimyocardial ab were all pending.  Pt was discharged on \nhome dose of asa and started on plavix 75.   \n.\nH. flu PNA: RML consilidation found post extubation.  Sputum cx \ngrew out h. flu and pt has not had prior vaccination.  He was \ntreated with azithromycin and ctx.  At time of d\/c he had two \nadditional days of ctx so was started on cefpodoxime to finish \nthe abx course.  \n.\n# Rhabdomyolysis: Thought to be secondary to amiodarone and \nAtorvastatin. Pt's CKs rose to >11K but kidney function remained \nnormal throughout.  He also had mild transaminitis.  With \naggressive fluid resuscitation, CK's trended down and were wnl \nby time of d\/c.  Kidney fxn remained wnl as well.  Pt should \navoid atorvastatin and other lipophilic statins in the future.  \n.\n# Delirium: After pt was extubated, he was persistently delerius \nwith difficulty following commands, signs of anterograde \namnesia, and difficulty with word finding.  He was also anxious \nand paranoid, particularly at night.  Over course of \nhospitalization his MS improved but was still mildly impaired at \ntime of d\/c.  There is concern for hypoxic brain injury \nsecondary to cardiac arrest.  This will need to be worked up as \nan outpatient and pt\/family were encourage to follow up with \ncognitive neurologist as above.  \n.\nTransitional:\n- needs f\/u in device clinic one week after discharge\n- ___ virus B AB, HSV 1 and 2 IGG, Myocardial Ab screen, \nParvovirus B19 Ab all pending at time of discharge\n- follow up final read on cardiac MR \n \nMedications on Admission:\n- Trazadone 50 hs occasionally\n- Neurontin 100 occasionally\n- Flexeril prn \n \nDischarge Medications:\n1. clopidogrel 75 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY \n(Daily).\nDisp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*\n2. aspirin 81 mg Tablet, Delayed Release (E.C.)

Multiple degenerative changes are mainly seen.\n\nIMPRESSION:\n1. Mild bronchiolitis a sequelae of viral or atypical infection.\n2. Thickening of the distalmost portion of the esophagus which \ncould represent esophagitis.\n3. Worsening left renal hydronephrosis with adjacent stranding \nand urothelial wall thickening which could represent \npyelonephritis or obstructive uropathy.\n4. Slight increase in the mild pericardial effusion could be \nearly pericarditis.\n\n          \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nSomnolence: The patient was initially noted be somnolent on \npresentation. After questioning, the patient noteded taking \nextra narcotic pain medication and received Xanax in \nanticipation of pheresis line placement. His somnolence quickly \nresolved and did ___ recur.\n\nFevers: The patient also presented with fevers with mild \nnon-productive cough and sore throat. The patient had multiple \nnegative blood, urine, and throat cultures. His CXR was clear \nand his chest CT showed only mild bronchiolitis, consistent with \na viral infection. He was initially treated with cefepime, which \nwas broadened to include vancomycin after he continued to have \nfevers. However, after his ANC recovered to a level above 500, \nhis fevers abated. His IV antibiotics were stopped after 5 days \nand he was begun on levofloxacin. He was monitored for the next \n2 days and was afebrile. He will continue the levofloxacin for \nan additional 10 days after discharge and possibly longer at the \ndiscretion of his primary oncologist.\n\nMultiple Myeloma: The patient presented for stem cell collection \nafter cytoxan mobilization. However, he was still neutropenic at \nthat time. His G-CSF was continued at 480mcg BID and eventually \nhis WBC count began to rise after some delay. On the day of \ndischarge, a tunelled pheresis catheter was placed and he had \nthe first of his stem cell collections at the pheresis unit. He \nwill continue this pheresis for a goal of 10x10^6 CD34+ cells\/kg \nbody weight. He will attend daily pheresis sessions until this \ngoal is reached. He will continue on his G-CSF during this time \nas well.\n\nUrinary retention: The patient was bladder scanned given his \nhistory of high residual volumes on his previous admission. \nAgain he was noted to have high residual volumes but continued \nto have normal urine output and normal kidney function. In \ndiscussion with urology, this was felt to be a normal effect of \nhis neobladder. He needs higher residual volumes to reach a \nvoiding threshold. The relatively unchanged left kidney \nhydronephrosis was felt to be a chronic change secondary to his \nprevious ureteral stricture on the left. \n\nBack pain: Chronic in nature. Well controlled with oxycontin and \noxycodone for break through. \n\n CAD - s\/p MI in ___ with RCA stenting, EF 50% and clean \ncoronaries ___  \nThe patient is ___ on ASA or a BB; may benefit from an ASA from \na survival standpoint after stabilized from transplant but ___ \nstarted now given risk of bleeding ___.  \n \n Atrial fibrillation  \n- on anticoagulation with coumadin at home but stopped  for \nautologous transplant; Will continue to hold coumadin \n___  \n  \nDepression  \n- cont citalopram  \n  \nHTN  \n- cont HCTZ  \n \nCOPD  \n- continue home regimen of Advair and Spiriva  \n\n PPx - Ambulate TID  \n  \n Code - FULL CODE  \n\n \nMedications on Admission:\nCitalopram 10mg daily  \nTrimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole 160-800mg PO Q ___  \nAcyclovir 400mg PO Q8H  \nFluticasone-Salmeterol 250-50mcg\/Dose, 1 Inhalation BID  \nTiotropium Bromide 18mcg 1 INH daily  \nOxycodone 5 mg ___ Tabs PO Q4H PRN  \nOxycontin 10mg PO Q12H  \nHydrochlorothiazide 25mg po daily  \nCiprofloxacin 500mg BID (started 8 days ago for prophylaxis)  \nNeupogen 480mcg BID since ___  \n\n \nDischarge Medications:\n1.

The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The \naortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic \nstenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The \nmitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral \nregurgitation. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic \nhypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.\nIMPRESSION: Normal global and regional biventricular systolic \nfunction. Moderate pulmonary hypertension. \n.\nTTE (___):\nIMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with \npreserved global and regional biventricular systolic function. \nMild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Mild mitral \nregurgitation.\nCompared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, \nthe findings are similar. LVEF > 55%.\n..\nPATHOLOGY:\nBONE MARROW BIOPSY (___):\nACUTE MYELOID LEUKEMIA.\nImmunoperoxidase stains show that the majority of the cells are \npositive for CD34.  Subsets stain for CD68 and myeloperoxidase. \nThese findings suggest myelomonocytic differentiation. In \naddition, the morphologic findings within erythrocytes in the \nperipheral blood are highly suggestive of concurrent iron \ndeficiency anemia.\n.\nBONE MARROW BIOPSY (___):\nDIAGNOSIS:\nPersistent\/recurrent acute myeloid leukemia, see note.\nBone marrow with chemotherapy effect.\nNote: While the core biopsy seems to be depleted consistent with \nchemotherapy effect, focal areas of the core and predominantly \nin a single focus within the attached clot biopsy reveals \nclusters and sheets of immature monocytes.  This along with flow \ncytometry is strongly suspicious of recurrent\/persistent \ninvolvement of acute myeloid leukemia.  As discussed at the \nclinical hematopathology combined conference (___), while \nthe morphological \/ flow cytometry evidence is strong for \npersistent increased blasts within the specimen submitted, we \nare unable to equivocally determine if these blasts are in the \nprocess of being ablated. Correlation with clinical and \ncytogenetic studies is recommended.\n..\nRADIOLOGY:\n.\nCT ABDOMEN\/PELVIS (___):\nIMPRESSION:\n1. No evidence of retroperitoneal bleed.\n2. Evidence for acute uncomplicated diverticulitis without focal \nfluid\ncollection.\n3. Ill-defined retroperitoneal fat infiltration extending also \nalong the\niliac chains bilaterally may relate to stated underlying \ndiagnosis of AML,\nthough evaluation for change is limited without priors.\n4. Splenomegaly with focal hypodense lesions..\n5. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions.\n6. Ill-defined small ground-glass attenuation nodules at the \nleft lower lobe a nonspecific finding.\n7. Cholelithiasis.\n.\nCT CHEST (___):\nIMPRESSION:\n1. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions with RLL consolidation.\n2. Multiple hazy peribronchovascular and centrolobular pulmonary \nnodules\nlikely reflect small airways disease, infectious or \ninflammatory.\n3. Extensive retroperitoneal soft tissue stranding around the \nceliac axis may be leukemic or lymphomatous tissue, \nextramedullary hematopoiesis, or less likely early developing \nretroperitoneal fibrosis.\n4. Splenomegaly with 1.1 x 1.4 ill-defined hypodense lesion in \nthe spleen,\nunchanged.\n.\nCT ABDOMEN\/PELVIS (___):\nIMPRESSION:\n1. Increased bilateral pleural effusions with associated \nparenchymal volume\nloss. No evidence of empyema. Superimposed infection cannot be \nexcluded.\n2. Mesenteric stranding and colonic wall thickening which may \nrepresent\nindolent diverticulitis; however, other pathologies causing \nfocal wall\nthickness, such as mass\/lymphomatous disease, should be \nconsidered. Endoscopy maybe useful.\n3. Hepatosplenomegaly.\n4. Cholelithiasis without evidence of acute cholecystitis.\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nIn summary, Mr. ___ is a ___ y\/o M with newly diagnosed AML \ns\/p \"7+3\" regimen with AraC and Idarubicin now transitioning to \nsupportive care.\n.\n# AML \/ BLAST CRISIS:  WBC count of 96.9 on admission was \nconcerning for new presentation of acute leukemia. Bone marrow \nbiopsy on admission confirmed the diagnosis of AML with greater \nthan 50% blasts.  Emergent leukophoresis was considered but \ndeferred. He was treated with \"7+3\" regimen with cytarabine and \nidarubicin, which he tolerated moderately. Tumor lysis labs were \nmonitored and he was treated symptomatically. To help his blood \ncounts return to normal, G-CSF was started on a daily basis.\n.\n30 days after the start of induction chemotherapy, a repeat bone \nmarrow biopsy was done.  The full results are provided above; \nfindings were most consistent with relapsing leukemia.  \nPeripheral smears in the days that followed showed increasing \nnumbers of blast cells.  At time of discharge it is clear that \nhis disease is relapsing.  However, after discussion with both \nMr. ___, his wife and his daughter, the decision has been \nmade to hold off on more chemotherapy.  The risks of more \ntreatment, including prolonged neutropenia, fevers, infection, \nand longer hospitalization, outweigh the benefits to be had in \nterms of survival.  There have been several family meetings and \nthe course we have agreed upon is for supportive care with \ntransfusions and antibiotics.  \n.\n# PANCYTOPENIA:  He had thromboctopenia with PLT 21 and anemia \nwith HCT 25 on admission.  After chemotherapy, he continued to \nhave low counts and was transfused on an almost daily basis with \npRBC and PLTs. Etiology of instability was explored (antibody \nworkup, hemolysis workup); however, no clear source was \nidentified. On ___, he developed a fever and SOB while \nreceiving blood and triggered for a transfusion reaction.   He \nnow always receives tylenol with his transfusions.  However, the \nworkup was negative and it was thought at the time that his \nunderlying fevers (drug vs infxn) and fluid-overloaded status \nprovided a better explanation for his symptoms.\n.\n# FEVERS:  He developed fevers up to 104. Given his \npost-chemotherapy neutropenia, he was worked up for infectious \ncauses and covered with broad-spectrum antimicrobials. Lung \nstudies (CXR\/CT) showed findings consistent with pneumonia; \nhowever, he did not have significant cough and all of his blood \ncultures were negative.  A urine culture grew VRE and he \nreceived a ten-day course of daptomycin.  Abdominal CT showed \ncolonic fat stranding and wall thickening indicative of \ndiverticulitis.  He was treated with meropenem and this \ntransitioned to a PO regimen of ciprofloxacin and metronidazole. \n At time of discharge, he has been afebrile for over one week \nand his diarrhea has resolved.  He will continue on PO \ncipro\/Flagyl in the setting of prolonged neutropenia.\n.  \n# CHEST PAIN \/ DYSPNEA ON EXERTION:  He presented with DOE and \nhe had been complaining of SOB\/chest pain intermittently during \nhis stay in the hospital. His cardiac enzymes remained flat on \neach occasion and the chest pain resolved on its own. GI causes \nwere also considered, especially since he has been c\/o \ndifficulty swallowing; however, speech and swallow studies did \nnot reveal a clear source of dysphagia\/odynophagia.  He was \ntreated with pantoprazole and chest pain resolved.  \n.\n# VOLUME STATUS:  Because of his anemia and thrombocytopenia, he \nhad to be transfused with pRBC and platelets on a daily basis \nwhich resulted in severe fluid overload (2+ leg edema, scrotal \nedema, pulmonary effusions, mild pulmonary edema).  He was \nplaced on O2 and nebulizer as needed and aggressive diuresis was \nstarted with furosemide 40mg IV TID. Repeat TTE showed no \nworsening in heart function after chemotherapy with \nanthracycline.  Gradually as his transfusions became less \nfrequent the standing Lasix was stopped.  He now gets 20 mg IV \nlasix when he needs transfusions.  At time of discharge he \ncontinued to have 2+ pitting edema and he is satting in the mid \nto high 90's on room air.\n.\n# DIARRHEA:  He developed severe diarrhea in the setting of \nneutropenia. C diff was negative multiple times and stool \nstudies were non-revealing.  As above, CT abdomen showed colonic \nwall changes consistent with diverticulitis, and his diarrhea \nresolved after treatment with meropenem transitioned to levo and \nFlagyl which he will continue for one week after discharge.\n.\n# RENAL FAILURE:  Baseline creatinine was unknown at admission.  \nIncreased NSAID usage was likely contributing, but also there \nwas likely a prerenal component and possibly some degree of uric \nacid nephropathy given uric acid of 14.9 on admission. He was \ntreated with continuous IVF with sodium bicarbonate, allopurinol \nand hydroxyurea.  His kidney function normalized and these \nmedications were discontinued prior to discharge.\n\n \nMedications on Admission:\nNaproxen (Aleve)\nNo prescription meds  \n\n \nDischarge Medications:\n1. Please obtain a standard wheel chair with elevating leg rests \nto be delivered to the patient's home. \n2. Please obtain a 3-in-1 bedside commode to be delivered to the \npatient's home.\n3.

You received chemotherapy but the cancer could not be fully cured. Since you received chemotherapy your blood counts have been low and you have required multiple blood transfusions and will likely continue to require these transfusions. You were also diagnosed with diverticulitis (inflammation of your colon) and are being treated with antibiotics for this. We have added medications to your regimen. These include antibiotics to help treat and prevent infection. To treat the diverticulitis, you will need to take 500 mg of ciprofloxacin twice daily for 7 days and 500 mg of flagyl three times daily for 7 days. You should not consume alcohol while you are on flagyl as this can cause an adverse reaction. You will also need to permenantly take 12.5 mg of metoprolol twice daily."}

CTA of \nthe abdomen and pelvis also showed hyperenhancement of adjacent \nliver parenchyma, which is also consistent with acute \ncholecystitis. Patient's abdominal exam remained stable and ___ \ndid not have any guarding, rebound tenderness or ___ sign. \nAdditionally, patient's abdominal pain resolved after the first \nday of presentation and ___ remained asymptomatic. Patient \notherwise remained AFVSS, with downtrending leukocytosis (11 on \ndischarge), as well as negative blood cultures. Per ACS, will \ndefer inpatient cholecystectomy, and recommended medical \nmanagement. Patient was treated with cipro\/flagyl \n(___) per Dr. ___ recommendations. Patient \nwas well-appearing with a very stable abdominal exam on the day \nof discharge. ___ will follow-up with ACS in the outpatient \nsetting for evaluation and planning of cholecystectomy. \n\n#Duodenal ulcer, gastric ulcer, esophagitis: On presentation, \npatient had N\/V that included a few streaks of blood. ___ did not \nhave any melena. ___ was evaluated by the inpatient GI team who \nperformed an EGD, which showed a 3 cm ulcer without high risk \nstigmata of bleeding was found in the duodenal bulb. Patient was \nalso found to have a few small shallow ulcers in the stomach \nbody, severe esophagitis in the mid esophagus, and friability in \nthe lower esophagus. Patient was managed conservatively with IV \nPPI followed by transitioning to PO PPI. H pylori testing was \nnegative. Per GI, patient would benefit from repeat endoscopy in \n10 weeks. This was discussed with patient and family with aid of \ninterpreter who cited understanding and will arrange outpatient \nfollow up for repeat EGD. Patient did not have any evidence of \nGIB while ___ was hospitalized. \n\n#Leukocytosis: Patient with leukocytosis that peaked at 25.6 but \nsubsequently downtrended to 11.6 on the day of discharge. This \nis likely in the setting of acute cholecystitis. \n\n# Acute on chronic COPD exacerbation: During this admission, \npatient developed mild-to-moderate shortness of breath with \nwheezing on exam that was likely due to a COPD flair. ___ was \nbriefly started on 1L NC and as his wheezing\/respiratory status \nimproved, was weaned to room air. Patient was treated with \nstanding duonebs with PRN albuterol, as well as a ___t the time of discharge, his respiratory \nexam was clear bilaterally, ___ was satting well on RA, and had \nan ambulatory O2 >96%. Patient was resumed on his home COPD \nregimen on discharge. \n\n#Calcified abdominal mass: Patient was found on CT Abd\/Pelvis to \nhave a partially calcified lesion measuring 2.7 x 1.6 x 1.4 cm \nalong the small bowel mesenteric root is indeterminate. The \ndifferential considerations include calcified aneurysm versus \nmesenteric mass. This lesion is not amenable for biopsy. On the \nCTA Abd\/pelvis, this was again visualized at the branch of the \nSMA in the mid-abdomen. Per radiology, this was likely due to a \nthrombosed aneurysm and chronic. Carcinoid is less favored given \nthe absence of small bowel abnormality and jejunal location. \nBased on read seems most likely benign and is in a location \nwhich is not amenable to biopsy limiting our ability to work it \nup further.

He underwent careful dressing \nchanges every ___ days. Compression and elevation of his legs \ngreatly improved the condition of his ulcers and lower extremity \nedema over the course of his hospitalization. He was eventually \ntransitioned to a bilateral unna boot dressing to his legs.\n\nIn addition he was started on broad spectrum IV antibiotics on \nadmission, vancomycin, cefepime, and flagyl. These were \ncontinued throughout his hospitalization. On day of discharge he \nwas sent home on PO ciprofloxacin, flagyl and doxycycline, which \nhe should continue for an additional 2 weeks until his follow up \nappointment with Dr. ___. His PICC line was discontinued \nafter he was transitioned to PO antibiotics. \n\nHis home medications were continued throughout his \nhospitalization. His leg pain was controlled with PO oxycodone \nas needed. He was continued on his aspirin and Plavix, as well \nas subcutaneous heparin throughout his stay. \n\nAfter multiple dressing changes, the patient was taken off \nbedrest and worked with physical therapy to get out of bed to \nchair. The patient should continue regaining his strength by \nworking with physical therapy and performing activity as \ntolerated. He should continue compression wraps to his bilateral \nlower extremities and elevation to help to relieve his lower \nextremity edema and allow for proper wound healing. \n\nHe should follow up with Dr. ___ as an outpatient.

However, this \nwas not the case as her eosinophil count remained low and her \nLFTs continued to improve.  The medical team and dermatology \nconsultant initially felt the rash was consistent with a \ndrug-induced rash and their highest suspicion for a causative \nagent was ursodiol.  Nonetheless, omeprazole and keppra have \nalso been known to cause rashes.  However, on further \nexamination, dermatology felt the rash was more consistent with \nher underlying eczema and possibile miliaria and her itching \nrelated to dry skin and recent bilirubin elevation.  They \nrecommended several medications which were started in the \nhospital.  Hepatology was also consulted and was fine with \nstopping ursodiol and the anti-pruitic regimen recommended by \ndermatology (fexofenadine, hydroxyzine, petrolatum, and topical \nsteroids).  Neurology was also consulted due to initial concern \nthat the rash could be caused by keppra, however, they had a low \nsuspicion that this was the causative agent.\n    \n# Cholestatic liver failure \/ DRESS: LFTs, Tbili, and synthetic \nfunction were monitored and noted to further improve from prior \ndischarge.  She was continued on prednisone with plan for slow \ntaper as an outpatient.  She will need to be seen by \ngastroenterology.  Due to confusion as to whether she should \nfollow-up with Dr. ___ she had already seen, or a ___ \ngastroenterologist, this decision was deferred to the patient's \nPCP.  Her PCP may also wish to consider referring the patient to \nDr. ___, a local expert in eosinophils and related \ndiseases. \n   \n# Anemia: The patient was noted to be anemic on presentation \n(hct 29) and her anemia was stable during her hospital course.  \nShe did not receive any blood transfusions.  She did have one \nepisode of rectal bleeding following an enema that was felt to \nbe traumatic.  This issue will require additional follow-up as \nan outpatient. \n     \n# ?Seizure disorder: The patient has no clear history of \nseizures, only an unrelated syncopal event earlier in the month \nfor which she was seen at an outside hospital, and myclonus in \nthe setting of hepatic encephalopathy during her last \nhospitalization.  Neurology was consulted and they recommended a \nroutine EEG.  Based on the lack of seizure activity, they were \ncomfortable with stopping keppra and recommended further \noutpatient follow-up.\n  \n# Depression and anxiety: The patient was continued on \nfluoxetine and seroquel.\n    \n# Constipation: The patient was placed on a bowel regimen with \nresolution of her symptoms. \n\n \nMedications on Admission:\nCalcium carbonate-vitamin D3 [Calcium with Vitamin D]\n600 mg(1,500mg) -400 unit Tablet daily\nFluoxetine 20 mg daily\nLevetiracetam 500 mg BID - patient ran out yesterday\nMultivitamin daily\nOmeprazole 20 mg daily\nPrednisone 40 mg daily\nQuetiapine 150 mg QHS\nUrsodiol 300 mg TID\n\n \nDischarge Medications:\n1.

While you were here, you received a chest x-ray, which showed no signs of infection or fluid overload. You also received an ECHO of your heart, which showed evidence of recent surgery, but nothing worrisome. You performed tests of lung function, called PFTs, which did not look concerning. We measured your oxygen levels when walking, and these levels looked good. We think that your shortness of breath was from fluid overload, and that this problem will likely continue to improve. You also received 1 day of chemotherapy while in the hospital. Your follow-up information is listed below."}

Together with the \ndyspoiesis seen in the current  marrow, the findings suggest a \nbackground of an underlying myelodysplastic\/myeloproliferative \nsyndrome; if the monocytosis was in the absence of an \nidentifiable secondary cause, diagnostic possibilities include \nan antecedent chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. Please correlate \nwith clinical and cytogenetic findings.  \n\n \n\nMICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION\n\nPeripheral Blood Smear:\n\nThe smear is adequate for evaluation.  The erythrocytes are \nmildly decreased and show anisopoikilocytosis with microcytes, \nhypochromasia and target cells. The white blood cells are \nincreased in number, are left-shifted with circulating immature \nmyeloid forms including blasts.  Granulocytes include dyspoietic \nforms with hypolobated, hypogranular and 'ring' ('donut) shaped \nnuclei.  The platelets are normal in number and exhibit large \nforms and occasional hypogranular forms.  Differential count \nshows   5% blasts, 8% myelocytes, 7% metamyelocytes, 58% \nneutrophils,  3% bands,  11% monocytes,   7% lymphocytes,  less \nthan 1% eosinophils, less than 1% basophils. \n\nAspirate Smear:\n\nThe aspirate material is adequate for evaluation; although it is \npaucispicular, the smears are markedly hypercellular.  M:E ratio \nis 6.4:1. There is markedly myeloid hyperplasia with \nleft-shifted maturation and increased blasts. The blasts are \nlarge, have fine chromatin, prominent nucleoli and scant amounts \nof cytoplasm.   Erythroid precursors are markedly decreased, \nshow maturation and dysplastic forms including asymmetric \nunclear budding.    Megakaryoctyes are present and include some \nsmall hypolobated forms and hyperchromatic forms; some naked \nnuclei are seen.  Differential (500 cells) shows:  30% Blasts,  \n3% Promyelocytes, 17% Myelocytes, 5% Metamyelocytes, 19% \nBands\/Neutrophils, 10% Plasma cells,  3% Lymphocytes, 13% \nErythroid.\n\nBiopsy and Clot Sections:\n\nThe core biopsy is adequate for evaluation and consist of a \npiece of trabecular bone with marrow elements.  The overall \ncellularity is approximately 90%.  The M:E ratio is increased.  \nThere are sheets of immature myeloid cells that are interrupted \nby erythroid islands.  The erythroid maturation appears mildly \ndyspoietic and megaloblastic.  Megakaryocytes are present in \nnormal numbers and show hypo- and hyper-lobated forms.\n\nThe clot section shows findings are similar to the core biopsy.  \n\nBy immunohistochemistry, CD34 immunoreactive blasts are \nincreased and comprise ___ of marrow cellularity.  CD117 \nstains blasts and early left-shifted myeloid precursors \ncomprising ~40% of cellularity.  CD33 stains a majority of the \ncells.\n\nAdditional studies:\n\nCytogenetics (see separate report).\n\nFlow cytometry (see separate report).\n\nMolecular (see separate report).\n\nClinical: ___ year old female HX MPD.  Now with increased WBC, \nevaluate for blast count, transformation to leukemia.\nGross:   \n\nThe specimen is received in one B+ fixative container, labeled \nwith the patient's name, ___, the medical record \nnumber,  and additionally labeled ___.  It consists of a \nbone marrow core measuring 1.8 x 0.2 cm in diameter, entirely \nsubmitted in cassette A, following decalcification.  Also in the \nsame container are multiple irregular portions of clot measuring \nup to 2.6 x 0.8 x 0.2 cm in aggregate, entirely submitted in \ncassette B.\n\nSPECIMEN: BONE MARROW ASPIRATE AND CORE ___  \n\nDIAGNOSIS:  \n \nCellular marrow with plasmacytosis and increased immature \nmonocytic precursors, see note.  \n\nNote: The marrow core biopsy is fragmented but appears \nhypercellular; although a significant proportion of the \ncellularity is comprised of plasma cell clusters and stromal \ncells, intervening immature mononuclear cells are also noted. \nThe corresponding aspirate shows several immature monocytic \nprecursors and monoblasts. By immunohistochemical staining, CD34 \nhighlights less than 5% of cellularity, CD117 highlights small \nclusters of myeloid cells. Notably, prior specimens have shown \nincreased CD34-positive blasts, however not all immature cells \nwere CD34-immunoreactive.  \n \nOverall, given the morphologic findings on the core and aspirate \nsmears, the findings are worrisome for residual disease. Please \ncorrelate with clinical findings. A re-biopsy to assess interval \nchange may be contributory.  \n\nMICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION  \n \nPeripheral Blood Smear:  \n\nThe peripheral smear is adequate for evaluation. Erythrocytes \nare diminished and exhibit mild anisopoikilocytosis with \noccasional elliptocytes, burr cells, and red cell fragments. The \nwhite cell count appears decreased. Neutrophils are markedly \ndecreased and exhibit dysplastic features including \nhyposegmentation and hypogranulation. Monocytes are normal in \nnumber and show some immature forms. Platelets are markedly \ndecreased in number. Differential shows: 1% neutrophils, 80% \nlymphocytes, 19% monocytes, <1% eosinophils, <1% basophils.  \n\nAspirate Smear:  \n \nThe aspirate is limited for evaluation. It consists of few \ncellular marrow spicules, however the cell are densely entrapped \nwithin particles with only few evaluable cells surrounding \nspicules and in feathered edge. Erythroid precursors are \nmarkedly decreased. Myeloid precursors are relatively increased \nand exhibit left-shifted maturation with increased blasts. \nHypogranular myeloids are seen. Megakaryocytes are not seen. \nRare hematophagocytic macrophages are seen. Due to \npaucicellularity of the specimen, only a limited count could be \nperformed.  \n\nDifferential (100 cells) shows: 23% Blasts (includes monoblasts \nand promocytes), <1% Promyelocytes, 3% Myelocytes, <1% \nMetamyelocytes, 8% Bands\/Neutrophils, 14% Plasma cells, 3% \nLymphocytes, <1% Erythroid.  \n\nClot Section and Biopsy Slides:  \n \nThe core biopsy is limited for evaluation due to fragmentation. \nMarrow cellularity is 70%. A significant proportion of the \ncellularity is comprised of clusters of plasma cells. Streaming \nof cells suggestive of fibrosis is seen; stromal cells are also \npresent. Admixed in this background are immature mononuclear \ncells with prominent nucleoli, morphologically suspicious for \nblasts; these are present singly and in small clusters.  \n\nBy immunohistochemical staining, CD34 highlights only occasional \ncells present singly, comprising less than 5% of total \ncellularity, as well as blood vessels. CD117 highlights few \nsmall clusters of early myeloid precursors. CD138 highlights \nabundant plasma cells. Stains for kappa and lambda are difficult \nto interpret due to high background and are being repeated. \n\n___ Echo\nThe left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is \nseen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure \nis ___ mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and \nregional\/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). There \nis no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size \nand free wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the \nsinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve \nleaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not \npresent. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve \nleaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve \nprolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid \nvalve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is borderline \npulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial \neffusion. \n\n___ CT chest w\/o contrast:\nINDICATION: ___ woman with myelodysplastic syndrome \ntransformed to \nAML, now with worsening hemoptysis, concern for infection versus \nfungal \nissues. \n  \nCOMPARISON: Portable AP chest radiograph, ___. \n  \nTECHNIQUE: MDCT axial images were obtained through the chest \nwithout the \nadministration of IV contrast. Multiplanar reformats were \ngenerated and \nreviewed. \n  \nFINDINGS: \n  \nCT OF THE CHEST: A 21 x 18 mm area of calcification within the \nleft thyroid lobe likely represents a calcified nodule. \nMediastinal lymph nodes do not meet CT size criteria for \npathologic enlargement. Hilar and axillary lymph nodes also do \nnot meet CT size criteria for pathologic enlargement. A \nsubclavian line is seen with the tip terminating in the expected \nregion of the mid to distal SVC. The heart is mildly enlarged \nwith coronary artery calcifications. Trace pericardial fluid is \nnoted. There are no pleural effusions.  \n  \nPatchy but widespread bilateral ground-glass opacities are noted \nwithin the lungs, right greater than left, and predominantly \nperibronchovascular.  Differential diagnosis includes \nopportunistic infection, edema, alveolar hemorrhage, or drug \ntoxicity. There appear to be more focal areas interspersed \namongst these ground-glass opacities which may represent \npulmonary nodule.  \n  \nThe study is not optimized for subdiaphragmatic evaluation. \nWithin this \nlimitation, the upper abdominal structures appear unremarkable. \n  \nVisualized osseous structures show no focal lytic or sclerotic \nlesions \nsuspicious for malignancy. \n  \nIMPRESSION: \n  \n1. Widespread but patchy bilateral ground-glass opacities and \nsmall \nill-defined coalescing nodules, right greater than left. The \ndifferential \ndiagnosis for ground glass includes infections including \natypical organisms, edema, alveolar hemorrhage, or drug \ntoxicity, but an infectious etiology is favored noting nodules \nand patchy asymmetric distribution. A follow-up chest CT should \nbe considered to show full clearance in addition to short-term \nradiographic follow-up.  \n  \n2. Chunky calcified nodule in the left lobe of the thyroid. \n  \n3. Left subclavian line with tip terminating within the mid to \ndistal SVC.\n\n___ CT head w\/o contrast:\n\nINDICATION: Refractory thrombocytopenia with new sudden onset \nheadache.  \nEvaluate for intracranial bleed or acute process. \n  \nTECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial images were obtained through the \nbrain. No \ncontrast was administered. \n  \nCOMPARISONS: None. \n  \nFINDINGS: There is no evidence of hemorrhage, edema, masses or \nmass effect.  There is a large area of encephalomalacia in the \nleft MCA territory with associated ex vacuo dilatation of the \ntemporal horn of the left lateral ventricle consistent with \nprior infarct. The ventricles and sulci are otherwise normal in \nsize and configuration. No fractures are identified.  There are \nbilateral atherosclerotic clacifications of the cavernous \ncarotid arteries.

No PFTs in our system but reports had been done \nin the past. Not on inhalers at home. The patient was placed on \nstanding duonebs and completed a 5 day course of prednisone 40mg \nand doxycycline on ___ with improvement of symptoms. Remained \nafebrile. Discharged home with nebulizer and duonebs with plans \nfollow-up with pulmonology clinic for further management.\n\n# Afib with RVR: On admission, the patient was noted to be in \nAfib with RVR with rates in 150s likely secondary to COPD \nexacerbation and dehydration. Had a transient episode of \nhypotension in ED with BP ___ which resolved with IVF \nbolus; mentating well throughout and no sensation of \npalpitations. Cardiology consulted and performed bedside TTE \nthat showed normal squeeze and no pleural effusion. The patient \nwas admitted to the CCU for further management. After admission, \nhe developed worsening chest pain with RVR in 140s which did not \nrespond to IVF bolus or diltiazem, and therefore he was loaded \nwith amiodarone gtt and 2 doses of digoxin. Troponins negative \nand EKG negative for ST changes. He then converted to NSR. He \nwas later transitioned to amiodarone 200mg daily and continued \non dabigatran for CHADS2VASc score of 3 (HTN, CHF, PAD). He \nremained in NSR and HD stable throughout the rest of his \nhospitalization.\n\n# Chest pain: The patient had chest pain in the setting of Afib \nwith RVR and COPD exacerbation. Troponins negative and EKG \nremarkable for Afib but no e\/o ST changes. CTA negative for PE. \nInitially there was concern for pericarditis given positional \nnature of the chest pain and recent URI symptoms (c\/f viral \npericariditis) and the patient was started on colchicine in the \nCCU. The medication was later discontinued once transferred to \nthe floor as concern for pericarditis was low-- no rub on exam, \nno PR depression or diffuse ST elevations on ECG and his chest \npain resolved. It was likely that the patient's chest pain was \ndue to his underlying COPD and persistent coughing which \nresolved as his symptoms improved.\n\n# Hypertension: The patient has a history of refractory \nhypertension currently on Amlodipine, lisinopril, carvedilol, \nand labetolol. These medications were initially held in the \nsetting of hypotension. His blood pressure improved s\/p \nconversion to NSR and he again became hypertensive with SBPs as \nhigh as 180. He was restarted on his home regimen with plans to \nfollow-up with Dr. ___ his primary care physician for \nfurther management. \n\n# HFpEF: BNP elevated to 1800 upon admission, but close to\/less \nthan prior value. CXR showed mild pulmonary congestion but exam \nwas negative for crackles in the lungs or peripheral edema. TTE \n___ with LVEF >55%, mild AR, very small pericardial effusion \nconsistent with prior echo from ___. No evidence of acute \nexacerbation in the hospital and the patient was restarted on \nhis home regimen once he returned to ___ and hypotension \nresolved. \n- preload: continued on Lasix 40mg PO daily\n- afterload: continued home lisinopril\n- contractility: initially started on metoprolol in CCU later \ntransitioned to home  carvedilol and labetalol on ___\n- strict I's and O's\n- low salt diet\n- daily standing weights\n\n# Hypotension: Became hypotensive in ED with SBP in ___ in the \nsetting of afib RVR (rates in 150s). Improved with IVF and \nconversion to NSR as above. Patient asymptomatic and mentating \nwell throughout. No further episodes of hypotension throughout \nhis hospital stay.\n\n# ___: Patient's creatinine elevated to 1.3 on admission likely \nin the setting of Afib with RVR and transient hypotension and \ndehyrdation. Resolved with IVF and returned to baseline of 0.9 \nupon discharge. \n\n#Anxiety: The patient suffers from significant anxiety \nespecially in the hospital environment. Maintained on his home \ndose of Ativan 0.5mg qid with prn doses as needed. Will need \nfurther management following discharge.\n\nCHRONIC ISSUES: \n# CAD s\/p DES ___: Continued ___, and restarted \nlabetolol and carvedilol upon discharge \n\n# PAD s\/p bilateral iliac stents ___: Continued ___, \naspirin, and pravastatin\n\n# Anemia: Long history of normocytic anemia with Hgb of 11.1 on \npresentation, relatively stable at 10.5. Consider further \nwork-up as an out-patient\n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\n======================\nTransitional Issues:\n-Patient restarted on home Carvedilol, Labetolol, Lisinopril and \nAmlodipine for resistant hypertension. Will likely need \nadjustment as out-patient. Rec from Dr. ___ \ncardiologist) is to up-titrate the labetolol and stop the \ncarvedilol if possible.\n-Patient has been very anxious in the hospital; maintained on \nhome dose of Ativan with prn doses as needed (takes 0.5mg qid at \nhome).

The ventricles and sulci are \nmildly prominent, consistent with age-related atrophic changes.  \nPost-contrast images show no areas of abnormal enhancement. No \nabnormal marrow signal is seen in the visualized bones. \n  \nAssessment of the arterial vasculature demonstrates patent \nanterior and \nposterior circulations without evidence for aneurysm or \nstenosis. The \nvertebrobasilar system is right dominant. \n  \nIMPRESSION: \n1. No evidence for metastatic disease or acute infarct. \n2. Normal intracranial arterial vasculature. \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ YO F with h\/o breast cancer in ___ who presents now with a \nlarge right pleural effusion and associated lung collapse as \nwell as hyponatremia likely resulting in seizure. \n\n# Pleural effusion with associated lung collapse. Highest \nconcern was for recurrence of malignancy. The patient underwent \na dx and therapeutic thoracentesis of 1600ccs. The fluid was \nsent for cell count, culture and cytology. The fluid was \nconsistent with an exudate but did not seem infectious in nature \n(875 WBCs, 81% lymphs, 6% atypical cells; pH 7.44, LDH 107, \ntotal protein 4.3, glucose 91). Cytology is pending at this \ntime. Prior to thoracentesis, the patient's oxygen saturation \nwas in the low ___ on room air. After the procedure, she was \nsatting in the mid ___ on RA with ambulation. Her post-procedure \nchest x-ray did demonstrate persistance of a mild to moderate \neffusion and the patient was counselled that her symptoms may \nvery well recurr. In addition to the above studies, a \nnasopharyngeal swab was sent for viral culture and retuned \nnegative. She was asked to seek medical attention should her \nsymptoms recurr and follow up with her PCP ___ 2 weeks for \ncytology results and consideration of further chest imaging \ndepending on cytology results.\n\n# Hyponatremia. This resolved quickly with the administration of \n2L NS and may have been provoked by free water intake in a \npredisposed host who has had intermittent hyponatremia in the \npast. She was instructed to drink to thirst in the future and \nnot to exceed ___ L of volume intake. Her exam and labs \n(slightly altered upon arrival, tongue trauma, elevated CK) \nsuggested that she had symptomatic hyponatremia complicated by a \nseizure. Neurology was consulted and recommended MRI\/A of the \npatient's brain which was done and was negative for mass or \nvascular abnormality. After reviewing, the MRI\/A, the \nneurologists agreed that she likely seized due to acute \nhyponatremia and recommended against anti-epileptic medications \nbut, rather, just recommended control of sodium levels. In \naddition, given her elevated CK, she was instructed to hold her \nstatin until further discussion with her PCP.\n \n# Back pain. CT from ___ reported several compression \ndeformities. Given above c\/f malignancy, this was relayed to the \npatient to be followed up on by her PCP. While in house, her \nmotor, sensory and reflex exams were normal and she was treated \nsymptomatically with a lidopatch, valium, oxycodone and tylenol. \n \n   \n# Initial report of hematemesis and hemoptysis were further \nclarified. It seems the patient was coughing up blood tinged \nsputum and did not, in fact, experience hematemesis. This was \nclarified after the patient's sodium returned to normal and her \nmental status cleared. \n\nThe patient remained full code throughout her hospitalization. \n\n \nMedications on Admission:\nLISINOPRIL - (Prescribed by Other Provider) - 40 mg Tablet - 1  \n(One) Tablet(s) by mouth once a day  \nSIMVASTATIN - (Prescribed by Other Provider) - 20 mg Tablet - 1  \n\n(One) Tablet(s) by mouth once a day  \n.  \nMedications - OTC  \nCALCIUM CARBONATE-VITAMIN D3 - (OTC) - 600 mg-400 unit Tablet -  \n\n1 (One) Tablet(s) by mouth twice a day  \nMULTIVITAMIN - (OTC) - Tablet - 1 (One) Tablet(s) by mouth  \nonce a day  \n\n \nDischarge Disposition:\nHome\n \nDischarge Diagnosis:\nPrimary: \nPleural Effusion with associated lung collapse\nHyponatremia \nSeizure\nHypertension\n\nSecondary: \nDuctal Carcinoma of the right breast s\/p masectomy in ___\n\n \nDischarge Condition:\nMental Status: Clear and coherent.\nLevel of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.\nActivity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.","summary":"You were admitted to the hospital for shortness of breath with a low oxygen level and a low sodium level. You were found to have fluid in the space between your lung and your diaphragm. This fluid was drained using a procedure called a thoracentesis. The reason for the fluid accumulation is not clear and there are labs tests pending to help us determine the cause of the fluid accumulation. It is quite possible that this will happen again so you must seek medical attention if you become more short of breath or have any other new symptoms. Your sodium level may have dropped because of large volumes of water ingestion. Your sodium level increased to normal with IV infusion of salt water and remained normal for the rest of your hospital course. You should only drink between 1 and 1.5 liters of fluid per day. Because of concern for a seizure, you were seen by a neurology team. They recommended a MRI\/A of your brain which they reviewed. After reviewing your MRI, they felt you likely had a seizure related to low sodium and not any abnormalities in your brain. Your CT scan from ___ showed compression of several of your vertebrae. You were treated with pain medications and anti-spasm medications while in the hospital which you are being given to go home with as well. You should not drive or make important decisions while taking these medications."}

You were taken to the intensive care unit where a procedure was performed called an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (\"EGD\"), where a bleeding ulcer was visualized in the first part of your small intestine. Attempts were made to stop the bleeding with the EGD, however they were unsuccessful. You were taken to interventional radiology were attempts at stopping the bleed was again attempted, but you achieved hemostasis and stopped bleeding without any further intervention. After your interventional procedure, no further bleeding was encountered. You were provided with red blood cell transfusions to increase the amount of red cells in your blood stream. During the EGD, it was indeterminate whether a mass was seen in the first part of the small intestine in addition to the ulcer. You will need to have a repeat endoscopy in ___ to reassess the area when you are not bleeding."}

The grade 2 \nanterolisthesis of C6 on C7 and grade ___ anterolisthesis of C4 \non C5 are little changed allowing for differences in rotation. \n\n___ C-spine Xray: The patient is status post posterior fusion \nspanning C3-C6. There is again seen grade II anterolisthesis of \nC4 over C5 which measures 9 mm and is stable. There is also \nanterolisthesis of C6 over C7, which measures 11 mm and is also \nrelatively stable. Degenerative changes with loss of \nintervertebral disc height at multiple levels is seen. There is \nsclerosis of the C7 vertebral body. Overall, there has been no \nappreciable change. \n\n___ C-spine Xray:\nSingle side lateral film of the cervical spine shows posterior \nfusion hardware extending from C3 through C6. There is osseous \nanterior fusion of C2 and C3 as well as C5 and C6. There is a \ngrade 2 anterolisthesis of C4 on C5 and C6 on C7 with appearance \nunchanged from similar bedside exam 23 minutes earlier. \n\n___ portable chest Xray: No significant changes since prior \nstudy. Lungs are well expanded and clear bilaterally. There is \nno pleural effusion, masses or lesions.  There is no \npneumothorax. The cardiomediatinal silhouette is within normal \nlimits and stable. Pleural surfaces and osseous structures are \nunremarkable. \n\n___ CT cervical Spine: IMPRESSION: \nLimited study due to streak artifact from hardware demonstrates \nnew \nanterior cervical discectomy and fusion from C4 to T1. Expected \npostoperative changes. \n\n___ Chest Xray: As compared to the previous radiograph, there \nhas been a cervical fusion. There is no evidence of pneumonia or \nother pathologic changes in the lungs. Unchanged mild symetrical \napical thickening. Normal size of the cardiac silhouette. No \npleural effusions, no pneumothorax. \n\n___ Lower extremity doppler US: no evidence of DVT\n\n___ CT C-spine-\n1. C4-T1 anterior and C3-T3 posterior fusion. Increasing \nfluid\/air \ncollections throughout the prevertebral, intraspinal, and \nperivertebral spaces and superior mediastinum could represent \npost-surgical changes, but it is difficult to exclude \nsuperimposed infection. If clinically indicated, \ncontrast-enhanced study of the neck and chest could be ordered \nto assess for possible abscess, fistula, and\/or mediastinitis. \nThis was paged to nurse ___ on ___ \nat 12:50 a.m. \n2. Moderate retropharyngeal edema. Limited evaluation of \nsupraglottic \nstructures due to retained secretions \n\n___ CXR-\n: As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has \nreceived a \nleft-sided PICC line. The course of the line is unremarkable, \nthe tip of the line projects over the mid SVC. There is no \nevidence of complications, \nnotably no pneumothorax. \n\n___ CXR\nFINDINGS: Compared to the previous radiograph, there is no \nrelevant change.  The tip of the endotracheal tube projects 2.7 \ncm above the carina. The course of the left-sided PICC line is \nconstant. No acute lung changes. Normal size of the cardiac \nsilhouette. Vertebral stabilization devices in unchanged \nposition. \n\n  \n___ CXR: FINDINGS: In comparison with study of ___, the tip of \nthe endotracheal tube measures about 5 cm above the carina. \nNasogastric tube extends well into the stomach. No acute \ncardiopulmonary disease. \n\n___ EEG:\nIMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study \nbecause \nof a slow and disorganized background. There is diffuse slowing \nof \nbackground for a few hours which could be indicative of \nmedication \neffect. However, the background activity appears again after \nthat \nportion of the recording. These findings are indicative of a \nmild \ndiffuse encephalopathy which is etiologically non-specific. \nThere were \nno focal asymmetries or epileptiform features. Compared to the \nprior \nday's recording, there is slight improvement and more \norganization of \nthe background activity. \n\n___ CXR A tracheostomy is in place. At the periphery of these \nfilms, cervical fixation hardware is noted. The apices are \nobscured by overlying mask.  Allowing for this, the lungs appear \nhyperinflated. Heart size is at the upper limits of normal. \nThere is upper zone redistribution, without overt CHF.  There is \nminimal hazy density in the left lung, which most likely \nrepresents mild atelectasis. No frank consolidation or gross \neffusion. Left subclavian PICC line tip overlies mid\/lower SVC. \nAllowing for artifact due to the oxygen mask, no pneumothorax is \ndetected. \n\n___ LENIES\nFINDINGS: Grayscale and color Doppler sonograms with spectral \nanalysis of the bilateral common femoral veins, superficial \nfemoral and popliteal veins was performed. There is normal \ncompressibility, flow and augmentation. There is normal flow and \ncompressibility in the left peroneal and posterior tibial veins. \nThe right calf veins were not visualized.   \nIMPRESSION: No bilateral lower extremity DVT. Right calf veins \nnot \nvisualized. \n\n___: CT C-spine\/neck\nIMPRESSION: \nPreliminary Report1. 2.5 x 2.1 x 6.2 cm fluid collection at the \nsurgical access site at the posterior cervical spine extending \nfrom C2 to T1 might be postsurgical, however, superimposed \ninfection cannot be excluded. \n2. Interval decrease of the previously seen prevertebral and \nsuperior \nmediastinal fluid collections.  3. 2.4-cm \nsupraglottic\/pre-epiglottic soft tissue mass. DDx includes \nectopic thyroid, atypical thyroglossal duct cyst or supraglottic \ncarcinoma.  \n\n___:\nFINDINGS: The liver shows no focal or textual abnormalities. \nThe portal vein is patent showing hepatopetal flow. \n  \nMultiple small gallbladder stones are seen. \nNo thickening or edema is seen in the gallbladder wall. \nThere is no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary duct dilatation. The \nCBD measures 0.3 cm.  \n  \nThe right kidney measures 10.2 cm and is normal without \nhydronephrosis or \nstones. The left kidney measures 8.8 cm and is normal without \nhydronephrosis or stones. \nAtherosclerotic disease of the aorta. \nIMPRESSION: Cholelithiasis without signs of cholecystitis. \n  \n___:\nMRI of head- \nIMPRESSION:  \n1. Hyperintense signal on diffusion weighted and FLAIR images in \nright medial frontal and parietal lobe without corresponding low \nsignal on ADC images. This likely represents seizure related \nchange. \n2.FLAIR hyperintensity in left posterior temporal lobe sulci, \nwhich is \nunchanged since the prior study. This likely represents a \ncortical vein \n3. Focal and confluent T2\/FLAIR hyperintensities in bilateral \nperiventricular and subcortical white matter of bilateral \ncerebral hemispheres and pons. The differential for this finding \nincludes demyelination, changes of chronic small vessel ischemic \ndisease or changes of vasculitis.  \n4. No abnormal leptomeningeal or parenchymal enhancement. \n\n___ MRI of c-spine: \n1. Post-operative changes in the form of anterior fusion from C4 \nto T1 \nvertebrae and posterior fusion at T2-T3 level. Although it is \ndifficult to \ncompare across imaging modalities, and the MR images are \nobscured by artifact \nfrom the fusion hardware, anterolisthesis of C3 over the fused \nvertebrae \nappears more severe than the prior CT. Repeat CT is advised if \nclinically \nindicated.   \n2. Peripherally enhancing collection in posterior paraspinal \nsoft tissues \nfrom C2 to C5 level which likely represents post-operative fluid \ncollection. This has decreased in size since the prior study.   \n3. Hyperintense signal in the spinal cord at C6-C7 level, which \nlikely \nrepresents edema from prior compression.   \n4. No abnormal leptomeningeal or intramedullary enhancement.  \n5. Supraglottic mass which is better evaluated on the prior CT \nimages. \n\n___ EEG:\n \nFINDINGS:  \nCONTINUOUS EEG RECORDING: Began at 7:01 on the morning of ___ \n___ and \ncontinued through 19:53 that evening. It showed normal posterior \n___ \nHz alpha frequency activity posteriorly wakefulness, as well as \nsome \ndrowsiness and sleep. \nSPIKE DETECTION PROGRAMS: Showed no clearly epileptiform \nfeatures. \nSEIZURE DETECTION PROGRAMS: Captured no electrographic seizures. \n\nPUSHBUTTON ACTIVATIONS: There were none. \nSLEEP: The patient progress from wakefulness to sleep at \ndifferent \ntimes with no additional findings. \nCARDIAC MONITOR: Showed a generally regular rhythm. \nIMPRESSION: This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations. \nThe \nbackground appeared remain normal, in wakefulness and sleep. \nThere were \nno electrographic seizures \n\n___ EKG:\nNormal sinus rhythm. Small inferior Q waves consistent with \npossible inferior myocardial infarction. No significant change \nfrom tracing of ___. \nTRACING #1 \n  Intervals Axes \nRate PR QRS QT\/QTc P QRS T \n101 132 76 ___ \nFINDINGS: Bilateral intracranial internal carotid arteries, \nvertebral \narteries, basilar artery and their major branches are patent \nwith no evidence of stenosis, occlusion or vascular \nmalformation. There are tiny outpouchings arising from the \nmedial aspect of the right cavernous ICA, which are less than 2 \nmm in size. These may represent infundibula of tiny branch \nvessels or small aneurysms. Evaluation of the brain parenchyma \nwas limited on these angiographic images. \n  \nIMPRESSION: \nTiny outpouchings from the medial aspect of right cavernous ICA \nmay represent small aneurysms or infundibula of branch vessels. \nOtherwise, unremarkable MRA of the brain. \n\n___ ECHO:\nConclusions  \nRegional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left \nventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Tissue \nDoppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling \npressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free \nwall motion are normal. The number of aortic valve leaflets \ncannot be determined. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild \n(1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are \nmildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The \npulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. \nThere is no pericardial effusion. \n\nIMPRESSION: Based on limited apical views only (no parasternal \nimaging available), left ventricular regional and global \nsystolic function are normal. Mild aortic regurgitation.   \n\n___ EKG: \nSinus rhythm. There are Q waves in the inferior leads consistent \nwith \npossible myocardial infarction. There are Q waves in the \nanterolateral leads consistent with possible myocardial \ninfarction. Compared to the previous tracing of ___ there is \nno significant change. \n Intervals Axes \nRate PR QRS QT\/QTc P QRS T \n76 150 68 ___ 86 \n \n___ VIDEO SWALLOW: \nFINDINGS: Barium passes freely through the oropharynx and \nesophagus without evidence of obstruction. There is profound \ngross aspiration with ice, nectar-thick and pudding \nconsistencies. The patient is status post anterior and posterior \ncervical spinal fusion with pre-epiglottic and prevertebral \nfluid collections seen on CT of ___. There is apparent holdup \nof barium at the upper esophageal sphincter, which may be \nrelated in part to narrowing of the esophagus due to swelling \nand fluid collections in the neck. \n  \nIMPRESSION: Profound gross aspiration with ice, nectar thick and \npudding \nconsistencies.

Her imaging studies were uploads and \nrevealled C7 to T1 listhesis.  \nPatient was admitted to the intensive care unit and placed in \ncervical traction. After reducing adequately, she was taken to \nthe Operating room on ___ and underwent a ___ \nCorpectomies and C4-T1 Fusion. This was without complication. \nShe was extubated, removed from traction and transferred back to \nthe ICU. Post operative CT revealed good fusion. A SOMI brace \nwas ordered and she was liberalized to HOB at 45 degrees. \n\nThe patient was febrile to 102.6 on ___ with a leukocytosis of \n17.7.  Blood and urine cultures were sent. CXR did not show a \ndefinite infiltrate however the patient did have a productive \ncough.  In the setting of elevated WBC, fever and cough she was \nstarted on Levofloxacin for PNA.  Sputum culture was requested. \nLower extremity dopplers were negative for DVT.\n\nA speech and swallow eval was ordered given patient's swallowing \ndifficulties and was performed on ___.  Unfortunately the \npatient failed the study and so she was placed on strict NPO \ndiet.\n\nOn ___ she was taken back to the OR and underwent a C3-T3 \nfusion. During positioning she was noted to have a sacral \ndecubitis so a wound care consult was called. INR was 1.5 and \nHCT was 22 so she was transfused with PRBC's and FFP. Post \noperatively she was not extubated due to laryngeal edema \n(difficult intubation) therefore ENT was consulted for \nevaluation. They recommended steroids, PPI and to keep her \nintubated. She was continued on vanc\/gent for prophylaxsis. On \n___ her exam was grossly stable but difficult to examine due to \nbeing intubated. CT C-spine revealed moderate retropharyngeal \nedema but no hardware malfunction or misalignment. On ___ she \nremained stable, extubation was discussed but she was not doing \nwell on CPAP trial and also did not have a cuff leak.\n\nOn ___, patient self extubated. She was breathing well on face \nmask. Strength was full post operatively and her pain was being \ntreated with morphine.  \n\nOn ___, the decadron was being weaned due to delirium and she \nrequired the addition of olanzapine. She was febrile to 101 on \n___ and she was pancultured. On this day she was reintubated \nfor hypoxia. She required high sedation to prevent self \nextubation. \n\nOn ___ the patient was being prepped for the OR with ENT but \nwas noticed in the afternoon to be unresponsive with eyes \ndeviated laterally and out, with flickering of the eye lids. She \nwas given dilantin and ativan and a stat Head CT was performed \nwhich was questionable for a right temporal hypodensity. Per \nneurorad recommendation an MRI was performed. This was negative \nfor stroke or lesion therefore an EEG was ordered to rule out \nseizure activity. EEG was negative therefore it was discontinued \nalong with the dilatin.\n\nOn ___ the patient was very lethargic so her sedation was held \n(> 1 hr) for examination. During this time she self-extubated. \nO2 sats were stable but she was noted to be aspirating therefore \nshe was reintubated and subsequently trached.\n\nOn ___ she was neurologically stable and vent was weaned to a \ntrach collar. Her staples were d\/c'd.\n\nOn ___ patient was transferred to the floor. However, she spiked \nanother low grade temp of 100.8 and was recultured and had an \nadditional chest x-ray. Fever work-up was negative, except for \npositive pan-sensitive pseudomonas on sputum culture. \n\nOn ___ Infectious disease consult was called due to patient's \nleukocytosis and continued fevers. They recommended switching \nher antibiotics to Cefepime, obtaining a mini-bal, a clostridium \ndifficile culture, and possible ___ guided LP. These studies were \nfound to be negative. \n\nOn ___ Her INR was found to be trending upwards.  Hematology was \nconsulted for their input and recommended Vit. K+.  Her PEG was \ndelayed because on her fever and wbc.  Nutrition recommendations \nfor TPN was initiated. ENT was also re-contacted for possibility \nof scoping this pt for eval of possible para-vocal mass that was \ninitially seen on intubation for ACDF. Due to concern \nsurrounding her waxing\/wanning mental status\n\nOn ___ Her INR returned to normal, her TPN was initiated as per \nnutrition. ENT did a fiberoptic evaluation and they found poor \nmanagement of secretions, but no mass and they signed off. She \nhad her LP in INR on this day. Neuromedicine saw her and fel;t \nthat she was in a oculogyrate crisis. Benadryl was given without \ngood effect. She was transfered to medicine due to the \ncomplexity of her problems.\n\nHer medical floor course can be summarized as follows:\n======================================================\nINACTIVE TISSUES:\n=================\n#. FEVERS\/LEUKOCYTOSIS:  She was inherited on vanco\/cefepime \nbroad spectrum antibiotics without clear source of infection- a \npan sensitive psuedomonas was found in the sputum but no \nradiographic evidence of pneumonia was ever apparent. On ___, \nher antibiotics were discontinued due to the lack of fevers and \na downtrending WBC.  A small fluid collection seen on CT along \nthe posterior cervical surgical incision site was sampled via \n___, with a bland fluid not suggestive of \ninfection.  Urine, blood cultures were negative, as were C dif.  \nOn ___, she spiked to 102, she was then restarted on vanco and \ncefepime. She had pan culture which at the time was all \nnegative. Her only + culture was from sputum the day before with \npan-sensitive pseudomonas, although there was no radiologic \nevidence of infection (pneumonia) this was thought to be causing \nelevation in WBC- so she was treated with cefepime for a total \nof 10 days last day was on ___ and she has been afebrile since \nthen. \n\n#. DELIRIUM\/ENCEPHALOPATHY: she showed a waxing and waning level \nof responsiveness.  EEG had previously shown only diffuse \nslowing of encephalopathy, which could have been from her \nsurgical interventions, steroids, zyprexa, infection.  There was \nconcern for seizure activity due to contraction of the arms and \neye deviation, so an extended EEG was conducted without definite \nevidence of seizures. Deliriogenic meds avoided. She was then \ntreated for seizures with Keppra and then Dilantin was added \nsince she continue to have seizure activity. Within hours of her \ndilantin infusion, she developed a severe rash. So this was \nstopped and she was continued on keppra and started on \nLacosamide. She was doing well and then had her last episode of \nconfusion last week in the setting of receiving trazadone for \nsleep and pain meds. Her sedating meds were held and pt has been \ndoing much better. Now A+O x 3. She was restarted on oxycodone \nfor pain and I would consider restarting Ambien once pt is \nstable on her new location. There were multiple head images \nwhich did not show anatomical cause of her confusion or seizures\n\n#. OCULOGYRIC CRISIS:  she had a dystonic reaction from zyprexa \nwith an unclosable mouth and eye deviation.  This lysed with IV \nbenadryl on ___.  She had similar symptoms on ___ which again \nresponded to IV benadryl.  Anti-psychotics were avoided.\n\nACTIVE ISSUES:\n===============\n\n#  Seizures: Has been having unusual EEG activity and three \nconfirmed seizures since ___, most recently on ___. She was \nloaded on Keppra on ___. Loaded with dilantin on ___ but \nexperienced a drug rash. She then had recurrence of witnessed sz \nover the weekend on ___ that lasted 3 min with lip smacking, \narm movement and blinking. No other event since then. Spoke to \nneurology who recommended increasing dose of Lacosamide from \n200-> 300 mg on ___. We still uncertain what is causing the sz \nactivity, multiple head images did not show anatomical causes. \nPossible encephalalitis r\/t medications.  However, pt has \nremained stable. Neuro is okay with us restarting pt on \nneurontin for neuropathic pain, so this was done on ___ and \ndose was increased to BID. \n- Continue ___ Keppra 1500mg BID and Lacosamide 300mg BID\n- Started on neurontin 300mg ___ on ___ for neuropathic pain \nwhich can increase to BID today if tolerating well and may \nincrease to TID \n- Neurology will be calling your facility to schedule a \nfollow-up appointment within 2 weeks. \n\n# s\/p Tracheostomy: Patient was complaining of sore throat and \ndiscomfort. No change in oxygen saturations. Dr. ___, \n___ surgeon, did not feel she was amenable to a trach \nrevision to a smaller trach.  Recommended ENT evaluation for \nincreased secretions, failed speech and swallow, apparent \ndifficulty with the trach. ENT saw pt on ___t \nbedside and findings are consistent with weakened muscles and \naspiration, so no intervention at this time, except for cont \nwith trach care, humidified oxygen and speech therapy. She also \nhad video swallow on ___ that showed aspiration. So for now pt \nshould cont to be NPO.  \n- Continue supplemental oxygen via trach mask\n- Trach care\n- Cont to work with speech therapy\n- Pt able to clear secreations and to use passmier valve\n.\n\n# s\/p cervical fusion\/Anterolisthesis: she was taken to the \noperating room on ___ and underwent a ___ Corpectomies \nand C4-T1 Fusion. This was without complication, but as noted \nabove she had multiple complications. Anterolisthesis (anterior \ndislocation of her spinous process) was found to have worsened \non the most recent MRI c-spine.  SOMI cervical brace was placed \nper Neurosurgery and should be on at all times. The brace was \njust adjusted yesterday and is fitting more comfortable by \npatient. She has small pressure ulcer on her chin that is \nhealing and on the back of her head that is also healing. \nNeurosurgery will be following the patient and she has \nappointment on ___. She will have a repeat CT scan at \nthat time.  \n- Per neurosurgery: Patient must be lying flat if she is in an \naspen collar, otherwise she must be put in a full neck brace at \nall times (would prefer not changing from SOMI brace to Collar \nsince concern for dislocation).\n\n# Pain: pt with pain at her surgical site and due to position \nrelated to brace. She has also chronic neuropathic pain and has \nbeen on neurontin and multiple meds prior to her admission. She \nasked to have neurotin restarted. Neuro was okay in adding this \nmedication. \n- Cont on tylenol ___ Q 6 hours as needed \n- Restarted on oxycodone 5mg Q 6 hours as needed\n- Restarted on neurotin 300mg once ___, will increase to BID \ntomorrow if tolerates and to TID on the following day\n.\n# CP\/SOB: Patient had previously reported having new, sudden \nonset chest pain that was sharp and substernal ___. Normal EKG, \nCXR and Trop. CKMB was initially 18.8 and has been trended down \nto 11. Given downward trend and current clinical status there is \nno concern for ACS.  Demand ischemia was considered but cardiac \necho performed on ___ showed that the left ventricular regional \nand global systolic functions are normal w\/ only mild aortic \nregurgitation.  CKMB may be originating from brain tissue.\n-Continue lipitor, low dose aspirin, and metoprolol\n.\n# Brain imaging findings: There were initial concerns about \nvasculitis since MRI of brain on ___ that showed focal and \nconfluent T2\/FLAIR hyperintensities in bilateral periventricular \nand subcortical white matter of bilateral cerebral hemispheres \nand pons. The differential for this finding includes \ndemyelination, changes of chronic small vessel ischemic disease \nor changes of vasculitis. So, rheumatology was consulted for \nevaluation of vasculitis, especially given her hx of + ___. She \nalso had a MRA brain on ___ was not c\/w vasculitis. Rheum panel \nwas sent w\/ only abnormality being anticardiolipin antibody IgM \nelevated to 16.2, which may occur with vasculitis, SLE or ACA \nsyndrome. However rheumo does not think that pt's findings are \nconsistent with vasculitis. \n.\n# Drug rash: Due to dilantin given timing of rash with dilantin \nadministration. Allergy list updated\n- Hold dilantin\n.\n# Blurry vision: Pt c\/o \"foggy vision at times\" which has been \nhappening since surgery. She with normal visual acuity. She was \nalso evaluted by neuro and had multiple head images which did \nnot show an anatomical abnormality. This does not appear to be \nan acute issue. The other potentially cause could be optic \nneuritis due to MS. ___ has not been r\/o yet as the MRI findings \nare some what suggestive.\n- she will be followed by neuro\n.\n# SKIN: pt with a small healing ulcer on submandibular are and \nscab on posterior occipital area. She also had a very small \nsacral decubitus ulcer that has healed. No signs of infection. \nCont with positioning and skin care.  \n.\n.\n# FEN:  replete electrolytes, NPO on TPN, Q4H oral care \n# Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin (MAY BE D\/C WITH INCREASE \nMOBILITY), ppi, bowel regimen  \n# Access: peripherals  \n# code: Full code (from chart) \n# Communication: Patient and her husband \n# ___ at ___\n\nTRANSITION OF CARE:\n===================\n\n# She will need to follow-up with Neurology who will be calling \nto schedule appointment with 2 weeks. If you do not hear from \nthen by ___, please call the neurology office to schedule \nf\/u appointment at ___\n\n# Continue to monitor for seizures, pt may continue to have occ \nseizures (usually associated with blank starring with blinking \nof the eyes, and arm movement. This has only lasted a few \nminutes at the time. During her last episode on ___ she had an \nepisode of hypoxia and had to have supplement 02 via AMBU bag \nfor a short period of time and this quickly improved with \nsupportive care. If continues to have episodes of seizures \nplease call the neurologist on call and may ask for advice \n(___). \n\n# She will be following up with neurosurgery on ___ with \nrepeat CT-cervical spine.

Heart attacks are caused by blockages in the coronary arteries that supply the heart muscle, whose pumping function depends on a constant supply of oxygen delivered by the blood supplied by these arteries. Severe blockages in the coronary arteries can cause the symptoms that you experienced because they deprive your heart of oxygen. During this hospitalization, the blockage in your coronary arteries that were causing your symptoms was opened during a procedure called a cardiac catheterization. During this procedure, a device called a stent was placed in the blocked artery to open the artery, restore blood flow through the artery and, in turn, restore oxygen supply to your heart muscle. This procedure should help to improve your symptoms and prevent future heart attacks. The catheterization, however, is only one part of your treatment; the other part of your treatment is your new medication regimen."}

Based \non history, suggestive of upper source (also BUN\/Cr ratio quite \nhigh), possible ulcer, especially in light of chronic prednisone \nuse. However, the patient was adamant that she did not want an \nEGD or colonoscopy. This was discussed with her family as well. \nShe understood the risks of forgoing endoscopy. She felt like \nshe was too old and did not want any interventions. She \ncontinued to have melena throughout her hospital stay, but her \nH\/H stabilized. She received a total of 3 units pRBCs and 1 unit \nof platelets during this hospital stay. Her most recent blood \ntransfusion was on ___ and from then until discharge on ___, \nher H\/H remained stable and she was hemodynamically stable. Her \nwarfarin was held on discharge until she can follow up with her \nPCP. This was discussed with the patient and she understood that \nthere is a risk of stroke off warfarin. \n\n# ___\nBaseline Cr ~1.4-1.5, presented with 2.0. Most likely this was \npre-renal from bleeding and concurrent diuresis. Her Cr returned \nto baseline (1.4) by the time of discharge. Her torsemide was \ninitially held, then resumed at half her home dose until she can \nfollow up with her PCP. \n\n# Hypernatremia\nLikely from volume depletion and from diuresis. This improved \nwith increased PO intake.\n\n# R ankle pain\n# Severe RA\nShe had no swelling or erythema and per patient no recent \ntrauma. Ankle XR showed no fracture or dislocation. ESR is up \nfrom ___ but CRP is down. This was consistent with her prior \nRA flares. She was continued on her home dose of prednisone 5 mg \ndaily. Her methotrexate was held. She was also given \nacetaminophen and a lidocaine patch. The lidocaine patch \nsignificantly relieved her pain.\n\nCHRONIC\/STABLE PROBLEMS:\n# CAD\n# LV Aneurysm\n# Chronic Systolic Heart Failure\n# Severe Aortic Stenosis\nLV aneurysm and history of strokes make the therapeutic decision \nof ongoing anticoagulation along with unresolved etiology of GI \nbleeding challenging. As discussed above, her warfarin was held \non discharge due to ongoing melena with stable H\/H. Unclear why \npatient is not on aspirin. She appeared euvolemic on exam \ndespite holding torsemide for most of her hospital stay. Her \nhome atorvastatin, metoprolol, and lisinopril were continued. \n\n# History of DVT\n- pneumoboots used in the hospital\n\nMs. ___ is clinically stable for discharge.

Most likely trigger for \nprogressive heart failure is severe aortic stenosis. No evidence \nof active ischemia, however coronary angiography with 30% LMCA, \n20% pLAD, 50% at origin of diag, 40-50% diag 2, 40% ___, \n100% mRCA. No evidence of tachyarrhythmia on PPM interrogation. \nRHC showed RA 10, PA ___ (46), RV 63\/8, PCW 24, LVEDP 23, RA \nsat 63% (per report), Hgb 11.4, CO 5, CI 2.8. SVR 1122, and PVR \n4.35. Patient placed on a Lasix drip that was transitioned to \nTorsemide alternating between 60mg and 80mg daily. Discharge \nweight was 69.72 kg (153.7 lb) and discharge Cr was 2.0.\n- PRELOAD: Torsemide 60-80mg daily (alternating daily)\n- AFTERLOAD: Held lisinopril given no BP room\n- NHBK: Held metoprolol succinate as cool extremities on \npresentation and in an acute CHF exacerbation. Did not restart \nprior to discharge - is to be followed as an outpatient for \nconsideration of reinitiation. \n- Aortic stenosis management as below \n\n# Low flow-low gradient severe AS\nRecent dobutamine stress echocardiogram demonstrated a mean AV \ngradient of 42 mmHg (27 mmHg on resting echocardiogram \npreviously) and an AV area of 0.57cm2. Patient is being consider \nfor TAVR and is being evaluated for same at ___. He underwent \npre-TAVR coronary angiogram given history of CAD which showed \n30% LMCA, 20% pLAD, 50% at origin of diag, 40-50% diag 2, 40% \n___, 100% mRCA. Cardiac Surgery was consulted and Mr. ___ \nwas deemed high risk for surgical AVR - they recommend \nproceeding with TAVR evaluation. Structural cardiology was \nconsulted and recommended further consideration of a TAVR as an \noutpatient. \n\n# Hypotension:\nBlood pressures on arrival to ___ and arrival to ___ were \nlow, 80-90s\/40-50s. Lactate was not elevated and he was \nasymptomatic. This is likely secondary to severe AS and poor \nforward flow. His home metoprolol and Lisinopril were held \nduring his hospital stay and were also held at discharge.\n\n# Elevated troponin\n# CAD status post DES to RCA \nTroponin-T elevated to 0.07 on admission, peaked at 0.08, in the \nabsence of chest pain or acute changes in breathing. Suspected \nthis was likely an elevation in setting of renal dysfunction. \nHowever, it is also possible this represents a type II NSTEMI in \nsetting of heart failure exacerbation given known CAD. He was \ncontinued on his home aspirin 81 mg and atorvastatin 80 mg QHS; \nhome metoprolol succinate was held during his admission due to \nlow BPs.\n\n# Anemia, normocytic:\nHb 11.4, no overt bleeding. Iron studies unremarkable. This was \nlikely secondary to CKD though cannot rule out alternative \ncauses including a primary bone marrow process. \n\n# Possible ___ on CKD\nBaseline creatinine 1.6-2.0; creatinine on admission at 2.0 and \nremained stable. His discharge Creatinine was 2.0. \n\n# 2nd degree AV block status post PPM\nEP interrogated PPM which did not demonstrate any \ntachyarrhythmias. Continued to monitor HRs on telemetry.\n\n# COPD:\n80 pack year smoking history. VBG suggestive of mild CO2 \nretention (pCO2 55, pH 7.30). He was continued on his home \nSpiriva and albuterol; home advair was started in place of \nsymbicort while inpatient (non-formulary). \n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\n======================\n# Acute on Chronic HFrEF\n- Admission weight:76.2 kg (bl weight ___ kg)\n- Discharge weight: 69.72 kg (153.7 lb)\n- Discharge creatinine: 2.0 (bl Cr 1.6-2.0)\n[] Held home Lisionpril and Metoprolol during his \nhospitalization and at discharge given low SBPs. Consider \nreinitiation as an outpatient. \n[] Will need outpatient BMP at next visit in order to monitor \nrenal function and electrolytes\n[] Discharged on Torsemide 60mg-80mg daily (alternating days). \nPlease titrate as needed based on standing weights and volume \nstatus. \n\n# Low-flow, low-gradient severe AS\n[] Evaluated by Cardiac surgery, who deemed him high risk for \nAVR and recommended proceeding with TAVR evaluation. \n[] Evaluated by Structural heart team, who recommended further \nevaluation as an outpatient.

She developed transient hypovolemic shock, \nlikely secondary to dehydration in the setting of diarrhea and \nnausea, complicated by syncope. She was transferred to the ICU, \nand started on broad spectrum antibiotics (cipro\/flagyl\/vanc), \nand received 3L LR. Blood pressures improved, but due to \nborderline MAPs and rise in lactate to 2.2, she briefly required \nlevophed for several hours. Her diarrhea improved and BPs \nremained stable off pressors, and she was transferred to ___, \nwhere she remained stable. \n\nACUTE ISSUES\n============\n#Diarrhea\n#Colitis\nMs. ___ presented with diarrhea, which was thought to be a \ntreatment complication of protocol ___. She has a history of \nC. Diff, but testing was negative. CT A\/P revealed \"acute \ncolitis extending from the descending colon through the rectum, \nlikely infectious in etiology.\" Per GI, there was no need for \nendoscopic intervention unless diarrhea recurred. They felt the \ncolitis was likely secondary to ischemia, given that the \nterritory involved was likely supplied by single vessel. \nDiarrhea was complicated by hypovolemic shock and vasovagal \nreaction for which she was briefly in ICU. Diarrhea resolved \nwith short course of loperamide. She was also treated with \nempiric cipro\/flagyl (___), and completed a 5 day course of \nempiric antibiotics. She will hold antibiotics until being seen \nby her oncologist in ___. \n\n#Hypovolemic Shock\n#Syncope\nShock was thought to likely be secondary to fluid losses from \nsignificant diarrhea, which has now\nresolved. She also experienced an episode of syncope during this \nacute hypotension\/diarrhea. She never had any focal neurologic \ndeficits. Hypotension was also thought to be in part due to \nconcurrent use of Metoprolol and Diltiazem for her Atrial \nFibrillation. Cortisol stimulation testing was negative for \nadrenal insufficiency. TTE showed low normal LVEF and mild \nvalvular abnormalities. She received fluid resuscitation and \nbrief pressors in ICU, and remained normotensive on the floor.\n\n#AFib (on apiaxaban)\nDuring her hospitalization, she was intermittently in AFib and \nintermittently in normal sinus rhythm. While hypotensive, she \nwas found to be in AFib with RVR. Home medications were briefly \nheld in the setting of recent shock, but heart rates remained \nelevated. Eventually, Ms. ___ was discharged on a new \nregimen of only Metoprolol 50 BID. She continued on her home \nApixaban.\n\nCHRONIC\/RESOLVED ISSUES\n=======================\n#Follicular lymphoma (Protocol ___\nMs. ___ is a patient of Dr. ___.

She asked again and he then raised the left but it\nseemed slower and weaker.  He told her he was ok and for her to\ngo to work today.  When she got home from work she noted that he\nwas still somewhat disoriented and favoring his left side.  His\nother family members also noted that he was not attending to the\nleft side.  They called oncology who instructed him to come to\nthe ER.  In the ER he was noted to have a left drift and left\nneglect.  CT was done and showed a right fronto-parietal\nhypodensity, likely stroke.  He denies any numbness, vision\nchanges, HA, speech problems.  He does feel slightly weaker on\nthe left.  He has not had any recent trauma.  \n\nHe was recently admitted to oncology for dehydration.  He was\nnoted to be hypotensive so the majority of his medications were\nd\/c'd.  Upon d\/c his wife states that they were told to d\/c\neverything except the lipitor.  He had been taking a full ASA up\nuntil that point.

There \nis a new \nfocus of hypodensity identified in the right frontal lobe \ninvolving both the gray and white matter. The appearance is most \nconsistent with cytotoxic edema secondary to acute infarct. \nThere is minimal mass effect on the adjacent frontal horn of \nlateral ventricle. Ventricles otherwise normal in size and \nconfiguration. There is no shift of midline structures. There \nare no abnormal extra-axial fluid collections. The gray-white \nmatter differentiation in the basal ganglia is preserved. \nVisualized bones demonstrate no acute abnormality. Paranasal \nsinuses and mastoid air cells are normally aerated. \n.  \nIMPRESSION: New hypodensity in the right frontal lobe, with \nappearance \nsuggestive of cytotoxic edema suggesting acute infarction. \nFurther evaluation with MRI is recommended. \n.\nMRI\/A Head and Neck (___):\nFINDINGS: There is no hemorrhage. There are multiple areas of \nabnormally \nrestricted diffusion involving the right frontal lobe, including \nthe large \narea seen on CT, as well as multiple punctate and smaller foci \nin the \nperisylvian region, within the right basal ganglia, in the \ncortex as well as the periventricular white matter, all within \nthe MCA territory distribution.  Most of these are now bright on \nT2\/FLAIR images as well. There is some local mass effect, \nparticularly from the largest of these lesions, but no shift of \nnormally midline structures, and no effacement of the right \nlateral ventricle. There is no hydrocephalus. There is mild \nprominence of ventricles, sulci and extra-axial CSF spaces. \nThere is mucosal thickening of scattered ethmoid air cells and a \nretention cyst in the left maxillary sinus. \n.  \nIMPRESSION: Several acute to subacute infarcts within the right \nMCA \nterritory. Findings are most suggestive of an embolic etiology. \n.  \nMRA OF THE HEAD: The study is limited by motion. There is a \npaucity of M3 \nand M4 branches within the right middle cerebral artery. There \nmay be an \nright MCA branch (102:6). There is no large aneurysm. \n.  \nIMPRESSION: Loss of flow signal within multiple M3 and M4 \nbranches in the \nright middle cerebral artery territory, and possible vessel \nocclusion, are \nalso compatible with embolic phenomenon. \n.  \n3D NON-CONTRAST TIME-OF-FLIGHT MRA OF THE NECK: The common and \ninternal \ncarotid arteries appear normal in caliber throughout their \ncourse, as do the vertebral arteries, without evidence of \nocclusion or hemodynamically \nsignificant stenosis. The origins of the great vessels are not \nwell seen. \n.  \nIMPRESSION: No evidence of hemodynamically significant stenosis \nor occlusion within the vessels of the neck. \n.  \n___ (___):\nIMPRESSION: Extensive deep vein thrombosis bilaterally extending \nfrom the \ncommon femoral vein to the popliteal vein. \n.\nTransthoracic Echocardiogram (___):\nDue to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion \nabnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular \nsystolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). There is a \ntrivial\/physiologic pericardial effusion. \n.\nIMPRESSION: Extremely limited study. Grossly-preserved left \nventricular systolic function. \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nMr. ___ is a ___ year-old right-handed man with a past \nmedical history including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and \npappillary renal cell cancer (metastatic to retroperitoneal and \nparacaval lymph nodes) who presented with left sided weakness \nand neglect.  He was admitted to the stroke service from ___ \nto ___.\n.\nAs there was concern for a right hemispheric stroke, an emergent \nCT of the head was performed.  The study demonstrated a \nhypodensity in the right frontal lobe associated with cytotoxic \nedema suggesting acute infarction. An MRI of the head and  neck \ndemonstrated several acute to subacute infarcts within the right \nMCA \nterritory.  MR angiography revealed loss of flow signal within \nmultiple M3 and M4 branches in the right middle cerebral artery \nterritory, and possible vessel occlusion thought to be \ncompatible with embolic phenomenon. The vessel imaging in the \nneck showed no contributory abnormalities to suggest artery to \nartery emboli.  \n.\nIn the setting of acute stroke, the aspirin was restarted at \nfull dose (325 mg po daily).  Blood pressure was allowed to \nautoregulate.\n.  \nIn the context of extended immobility and malignancy, there was \nconcern for deep vein thrombosis (DVT).  Ultrasound imaging of \nthe lower extremities confirmed extensive deep vein thrombosis \nbilaterally extending from the common femoral vein to the \npopliteal vein. Accordingly, a heparin drip was started with a \ngoal PTT of 50 to 70, and aspirin was discontinued.  At Dr. \n___ oncologist) recommendation, lovenox 1mg\/kg \nevery 12 hours (rather than coumadin) was started prior to \ndischarge for long-term anti-coagulation.  The lovenox should be \ncontinued for at least six months. Of note, if renal function \ndeclines (eg creatinine increases above 2), the lovenox dosing \nshould be adjusted to 1mg\/kg q 24 hours.\n.\nGiven the embolic apperance of the strokes and the presence of \nDVTs, a transthoracic echocardiogram was done to evaluate for a \npatent foramen ovale (PFO).  Unfortunately, the study was \nsub-optimal and could not determine whether or not a PFO was \npresent. The estimated systolic function was normal (LVEF >55%).\n.\nTo evaluate modifiable risk factors for stroke, lipids and \nglycosylated hemoglobin were measured.  As the LDL was found to \nbe 119, the statin dose was increased to 10 mg daily to 20 mg po \ndaily with a goal LDL of approximately 70.  Although the HBA1C \nwas 6.4 %, blood glucose was monitored regularly and an insulin \nsliding was instituted to maintain normoglycemia.\n.\nIn the course of the hospitalization, Mr. ___ hematocrit \ndipped to the 24 range.  A review of OMR suggests a baseline \nhematocrit around ___ since ___.  Accordingly, the \nvalue was closely monitored.  It remained stable in the ___ \nrange.  There was no evidence of bleeding.  The etiology is \nthought to be hemodilution and blood draws.\n.\nTo evaluate the microcytic anemia, iron studies were performed. \nThe resulst are thought to be consistent with anemia of chronic \ndisease.\n.\nPrior to discharge laboratory studies demonstrated evidence of a \nurinary tract infection.  Accordingly, a seven-day course of \nciprofloxacin was started.\n.\nMembers of the physical therapy team participated in the \n___ care and recommended he be discharged home with \nphysical therapy services.\n \nMedications on Admission:\nMedications:\n- atorvastatin 10 mg daily\n- everolimus daily\n.\nAllergies: Tetracycline - rash\n \n\n \nDischarge Medications:\n1.

An MRI revealed several strokes in the right hemisphere of the brain. Imaging indicated there were no contributory abnormalities in the neck vessels. Ultrasound demonstrated blood clots in the deep veins of both of your legs. The ultrasound of the heart was limited and did not clearly demonstrate a connection between the right and left heart or evidence of blood clots and vegetations. However, the appearance of the strokes suggests the etiology was a blood clot at the level of the heart or the legs. To help address the blood clots in the legs, a medicine called lovenox was started. Your oncologist Dr. ___ this particular blood thinner was superior to coumadin. This medicine should be continued for at least six months. Please note that the weekend supply of lovenox will be ready for you at the ___ Pharmacy at ___. The ___ ___ in ___ has ordered a more long-term supply. Modifiable risk factors for stroke were checked. As the LDL was high, the statin dose was increased from 10 to 20 mg by mouth daily."}

Patient has underlying dementia at \nbaseline per prior OMR records, but per daughter the current \nsymptoms are acute. Patient was alert and oriented at time of \ninitial exam, but speech was very tangential\/rambling. The \npatient's mental status waxed and waned over the course of this \nadmission. Given recent fall, there is concern for possible late \nsubdural bleed, although head CT negative. Patient's UA was \nsuggestive of possible UTI (culture ultimately grew E. coli), \nand per nursing urine was foul-smelling. Infection could also \ncause acute delirium. Pain in arm from fall could also \ncontribute. Finally, patient reports recent frequent vomiting \nand may have become dehydrated - this could also contribute to \ndelirium. The patient received IVF to correct dehydration. \nTramadol was stopped. Acetaminophen was started to control any \npain from his fall. Telemetry and Foley were ultimately \ndiscontinued to minimize lines. The patient was re-oriented as \nneeded. UTI was treated with antibiotics. The patient's mental \nstatus improved, although not quite to his baseline per \ndaughters. The patient and his family were cautioned that the \ndelirium may come and go over the next few days to weeks. The \npatient was asked not to drive until after his follow up \nappointment with his PCP. \n \n# UTI. UA was positive on admission. Patient self-catheterizes \nat home three times daily given BPH. This is likely to introduce \norganisms into the bladder, and long periods of urine stasis \nlikewise will promote infection. Prior cultures in our system \nhave grown coag-positive staph and enterococcus. Patient \nreceived ceftriaxone until cultures returned positive for \npan-sensitive E. coli on the day of discharge; he was then \nconverted to ciprofloxacin to complete a 10-day course for \ncomplicated UTI.\n\n# Recent fall. Per patient, this was a mechanical event - states \nhe slipped on ice which he mistook for a puddle. He landed on \nhis left elbow but feels most pain in his left shoulder. No \nvisible markings on elbow which patient states is because he was \nwearing a heavy overcoat. No acute changes on plain film from \n___. He was observed to use his arm minimally, although \npassive range of motion was intact. Additional plain films of \nthe humerus were obtained which showed no fracture. He was seen \nby occupational and physical therapy services, who recommend \ninitial home OT followed by outpatient ___ until recovered. He \nwas placed on standing acetaminophen 500 mg QID while in-patient \nto minimize pain (although patient had few complaints at rest) \nas well as contribution of pain to altered mental status. \nTramadol was discontinued.\n\n# Vomiting. Per patient, has vomited several times over past few \ndays in response to eating. He attributes N\/V to the tramadol \nwhich also causes a \"bitter taste.\" Gastroenteritis also a \npossibility. No N\/V during this admission. The patient received \nIVF as above to correct any dehydration. Tramadol was held as \nabove. \n\n# Vertigo. Patient reports vertigo symptoms (\"the room is \nspinning\") earlier on the day of admission. Has symptoms on and \noff at baseline. During this admission, patient's symptoms were \nmild. Continued on meclizine.\n\n# Urinary retention. Secondary to BPH. ___ was placed \ninitially, but prior to discharge ___ was removed and patient \nwas allowed to straight cath himself. He was able to do so \nsuccessfully (not limited by pain in his left arm\/shoulder), but \nthe nurse noted that patient's clean technique could use \nimprovement. \n\n# Hypercholesterolemia. Continued on simvastatin.\n\n# Insomnia. Continued on oxazepam as the patient reported he \ntakes this medication nightly. If delirium persists, would \nconsider weaning off as an outpatient.\n\n# Anemia. Hct found to be at baseline (mid-30s). Continued on \niron.\n\n# Communication - Patient and daughters.\n# Code - Full code (per patient).

Neurology was consulted and EEG was \nperformed that did not show seizure activity.  She was found to \nhave a UTI, urine culture grew klebsiella.  She was treated with \nceftriaxone that was later changed to meropenem given concern \nfor possible angioedema (see below).  She was then found to have \nfungal UTI and was started on fluconazole (see below).  Mental \nstatus returned to baseline.  She was continued on her home dose \nof phenytoin then uptitrated as she was subtherapeutic (see \nbelow).\n.\n# Seizure disorder: Patient initially presented with concern for \nseizures.  Neurology was consulted and EEG did not show seizure \nactivity. Patient continued on her home dilantin dose.  On ___ \npatient had seizure x3.  Dilantin level was checked and was \nundectable.  Patient was reloaded with IV fosphenytoin.  \nPatient's home dilantin dose was increased to 125 mg BID. \nDilantin level at time of discharge was 14.9 when corrected for \nhypoalbuminemia.  Please recheck patient's dilantin dose in \nthree days and adjust dilantin dosing; target dilantin level is \n16.\n.\n# UTI, bacterial, and UTI, candidal: Pt initially had klebsiella \nUTI treated with meropenem. She had repeat UA after seizure with \n150 WBCs.  Urine culture grew yeast x3.  Discussed with ID, \nstarted fluconazole for 10 days.  Last dose for fluconazole is \n___. Please follow up with a repeat UA at the end of \nfluconazole course.\n.\n# Respiratory distress: Upon presentation to ED, concern was \nhigh for seizure and pt received benzodiazepines.  In this \nsetting, she developed hypoxia and required intubation.  She \nrequired minimal ventilatory support and was able to follow \ncommands without need for much sedation.  Extubation was \nattempted on ___ but she required re-intubation within 3 \nhours due to respiratory distress.  She had a large amount of \nlaryngeal edema that was felt to be  responsible for her failed \nextubation and she was placed on IV steroids to reduce swelling. \n She had several allergies to antibiotics with adverse reaction \nbeing angioedema.  Given concern that her ceftriaxone may be \ncausing angioedema, she was switched to meropenem.  Extubation \nwas attempted again on ___ she once again developed \nrespiratory distress and hypoxia within 6 hours and required \nre-intubation.  A large amount of edema was again noted.  ENT \nwas consulted regarding tracheostomy.  They recommended CT neck \nto evaluate size of her large multinodular goiter.  They brought \nher to the OR on ___ for subtotal thyroidectomy and \nextubation was again performed on ___.  While in the ICU, \npatient's total body balance was positive 14 liters and crackles \nwere appreciated on lung exam and she had edema of her limbs.  \nPatient was given lasix and her edema improved along with her \nlung exam.  Please monitor patient's fluid status and \nrespiratory status and give diuretics as needed. Extra fluid in \nher body should mobilize and be excreted in urine.\n.\n# s\/p Subtotal thyroidectomy: Pt was noted to have large \nmultinodular goiter.  TFTs were within  normal limits.  She had \nbeen on methimazole as outpatient; this was not continued in \n___.  CT neck showed large goiter and pt was seen by ENT who \nrecommended thyroidectomy as the goiter was compressing her \ntrachea and may have been the reason for her failed extubations. \n Thoracic surgery was also called regarding possible \ntracheomalacia seen on CT scan.  Thoracic surgery felt that this \nwas not tracheomalacia but rather compression of trachea from \nthyroid mass.  She underwent thyroidectomy on ___.  Right \nthyroid lobe was left; parathyroids were left in place.  Calcium \nwas monitored carefully postoperatively.  She had JP drain in \nplace after surgery which was removed. She should follow up with \nher endocrinologist 3 weeks after discharge and Dr. ___ to \nfollow up with outcome of surgery.\n.\n# Volume overload \/ upper extremity edema:  Patient's total body \nfluid balance during her ICU stay was positive 14 liters.  She \nrequired several doses of IV lasix as she developed pulmonary \nedema.  Her upper extremities were noted to be swollen (L>R).  \nBilateral upper extremity ultrasound was obtained and showed \nno-occlussive thrombi in right and left IJ.  No anti-coagulation \nwas initated as there is no clear evidence of benefit in \nnon-occlussive thrombi.  Please continue to monitor patient's \nupper extremities and reevaluate as needed.\n.\n# Transitional issues:\n1) Follow up with ENT in 2 weeks; must call to schedule \nappointment\n2) Follow up with endocrinology in 3 weeks; must call to \nschedule appointment\n3) Follow up with PCP regarding this hospitalization\n4) Recheck dilantin level in 3 days (must correct for \nhypoalbuminemia) and consider readjusting dosing; target level \nis 16.\n5) Notable labs on last check here: Hct 27.4, Cr 1.5, ALT 47, \nAST 31, phenytoin (Dilantin) level 11.3.

Your confusion was likely multifactorial as outlined below. You were given lorazepam because there were concerns of seizures, but EEG monitoring did not reveal any evidence of seizure. As a consequence, your breathing was suppressed and had to be sedated and intubated to help you breath better. After successful removal of your breathing tube, you had a seizure and was found that your dilantin level was subtherapeutic secondary to propofol withdrawal and malabsorption of dilantin due to the tube feed you were receiving while intubated. You received loading doses of dilantin and your maintenance dose was increased to 125mg twice daily from 100mg twice daily. On the day of discharge, your dilantin level adjusted for hypoalbuminemia was 14.9."}

No cholelithiasis or cholecystitis is present. \n---PRELIMINARY REPORT---\n\n# MRCP w\/ and w\/p ___\nAt the junction of the left hepatic duct, right anterior hepatic \nduct, right posterior hepatic duct there is bulbous dilatation \nof the origin of the common hepatic duct to 2.0 cm (TV) x 1.0 cm \n(AP) x 1.3 cm (CC) which is continuous with a common bile duct \nbulbous dilatation to 6.5 cm (TV) x 3.1 cm (AP) x 6.6 cm (CC).  \nThese findings are suggestive of a bilobed choledochal cyst, \ntype IV.  Within the common bile duct portion of this bilobed \ncholedochal cyst, there is a 3.8 cm (TV) x 1.7 cm (AP) x 3.7 cm \n(CC) lesion which is hypoinense to liver and pancreas on \nT1-weighted imaging, hyperintense on T2-weighted imaging, and \ndemonstrating enhancement as well as restricted diffusion, and \nsuggestive of a malignancy, likely cholangiocarcinoma.  This \nmass has a broad \nattachment to the posterior wall of the common bile duct with \nirregularity of the posterior aspect of the common bile duct \nwhich are concerning for invasion through the wall. At the \njunction of the IVC and left renal vein, no clear fat plane is \nidentified between this mass within the posterior aspect of the \ncommon bile duct and the left renal vein. A non-enhancing focus \nis noted in this mass and likely representative of necrosis \n(1003:76). \n  \nThe intrapancreatic portion of the common bile duct appears \nwithin normal \nlimits and the pancreatic duct is not clearly identified on this \nstudy. The liver is otherwise within normal limits.  There is \nconventional hepatic arterial anatomy.  The splenic, super \nmesenteric, main portal, and right and left portal veins are \npatent. \n  \nThe cystic duct inserts into the common bile duct portion of the \ncholedochal cyst. The gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, stomach, \nbilateral kidneys, bilateral adrenal glands are within normal \nlimits. There is no significant free fluid. There is no \nmesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. Bone marrow \nsignal is within normal limits. \n  \nIMPRESSION:  \n  Bilobed choledochal cyst involving the common hepatic duct and \nthe proximal common bile duct to the level of the pancreas.  \nWithin the common bile duct choledochal cyst is a 3.8 cm \nenhancing mass with restricted diffusion that is highly \nconcerning for cholangiocarcinoma. This mass has a broad \nattachment to the posterior wall of the common bile duct with \nirregularity of the posterior aspect of the common bile duct, \nwhich is concerning for invasion into and through the wall; \nparticularly at the junction of the IVC and left renal vein \nwhere no clear fat plane is identified between this mass within \nthe posterior aspect of the common bile duct and the left renal \nvein.  No lymphadenopathy or other lesions. \n  \nNo intrahepatic bile duct dilation with the tiny right and left \nhepatic ducts inserting into the dilated CHD.  Normal cystic \nduct caliber and normal appearance of the gallbladder. \n\nERCP report ___\nFindings: Esophagus: Limited exam of the esophagus was normal \nStomach: Limited exam of the stomach was normal \nDuodenum: Limited exam of the duodenum was normal \nMajor Papilla: Normal major papilla \nCannulation:  Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful and \ndeep with a sphincterotome using a free-hand technique.

The LHD was filled with contrast and appeared \nnormal. The RHD and IHBDs were not well visualized. There were \nno filling defects\/strictures seen. A biliary sphincterotomy was \nmade with a sphincterotome. There was no post-sphincterotomy \nbleeding. Excellent bile and contrast drainage was seen \nendoscopically and fluoroscopically.  \nProcedures: A sphincterotomy was performed in the 12 o'clock \nposition using a sphincterotome over an existing guidewire.\n\nSpyglass cholangioscopy was performed. Abnormal mucosa \ncharacterized by erythema, friability and vascularity was seen. \nThe appearance was concerning for malignancy. Spybite biopsies \nwere performed for histology.\n\nCytology samples were obtained for histology using a brush in \nthe main duct. A double pigtail plastic biliary stent was placed \nsuccessfully.\n\n \nRadiologic interpretation: I supervised the acquisition and \ninterpretation of the fluoroscopic images.

Communicated recommendation to PCP who can \nrefer as needed\n\nACUTE\/ACTIVE ISSUES\n==================\n# Acute kidney injury \nBaseline Cr 0.7-1.1, elevated to 1.8 in ED. Initially thought \nprerenal iso poor PO, but did not improve with fluids. Given \npossible falls recently, rhabdomyolysis was considered, but CK \nwas normal. SPEP was normal. There was also concern for possible \nintrinsic renal injury such as ATN given elevated urine Na, but \nno casts were seen on U\/A. Patient had renal ultrasound on ___ \nwhich showed grade 4 severe hydronephrosis of the R kidney and \nhypotrophic L kidney. Patient had no signs of pyelonephritis or \ninfection at the time. Patient underwent CT abdomen\/pelvis \nwithout contrast, with no obstructing stone seen, but did show \nacute on chronic large sigmoid volvulus with large bowel \nobstruction likely causing moderate-severe R hydronephrosis by \nmass effect. It is unclear if the hydronephrosis is acute or \nchronic, and whether volvulus is related. ___ likely in setting \nof unilateral hydronephrosis with hypotrophic L kidney. Urology \nand renal were consulted and patient underwent renal nuclear \nstudy on ___ to evaluate for UPJ obstruction and determine if \nrenal function was preserved. Scan showed partial obstruction at \nthe R UPJ, with decreased bilateral blood flow but essentially \nnormal L renal function. Given partial renal function and \ndiscussion with patient's healthcare proxy of the patient's \ngoals of care in the setting of her comorbidities and baseline \ndementia, urology team recommended attempting non-operative \ntreatment at this time as long as renal function remains \nrelatively stable. Patient will need renal function monitored \nclosely by her PCP given no plans for inpatient intervention at \nthis time. If renal function worsens in outpatient setting, \npatient should be urgently referred to ___ in ___ \n___ clinic to discuss long term management of UPJ \nobstruction. Patient's home lisinopril was held iso ___. \nDischarge Creatinine of 2.1.\n\n# Chronic large sigmoid volvulus, not actively obstructed \nPatient has history of large bowel obstruction presenting with \nsubtle symptoms and is also s\/p colectomy. Given history and \nconcern that patient unable to verbalize symptoms ___ baseline \ndementia, patient underwent abdominal X-ray on ___ which showed \nnonspecific non obstructive bowel gas pattern. Given R kidney \nhydronephrosis (as detailed above) obtained CT A\/P without \ncontrast that showed acute on chronic large sigmoid volvulus \nwith large bowel obstruction likely causing moderate-severe R \nhydronephrosis by mass effect. Reassuring as it is acute on \nchronic, imaging read as decreased compared to ___, and \npatient hemodynamically stable. ACS was consulted and was not \nconcerned for clinical obstruction, therefore recommend \noutpatient follow up and no need for emergent or urgent surgical \nintervention. GI was consulted and did not feel there is a role \nfor colonoscopy at this point and thought that the patient needs \neventual, non-urgent surgical intervention. Serial abdominal \nexams were monitored and reassuring. \n\n#Unresponsive episode\nPatient found to be unresponsive on ___ AM and was hypotensive \nto 70\/48, last seen normal 20 minutes prior. FSBG 142. Patient \nwas bolused IV fluids and SBP improved to 130s. After BP \nimproved, her mental status returned to baseline. Neuro exam at \nthis time was unremarkable, as was abdomen, cardiovascular and \nrespiratory exams. EKG revealed mild sinus bradycardia, \nunchanged from prior. VBG notable for elevated CO2 but likely in \nsetting decreased respiration during episode. CT head WO \ncontrast was without acute findings. 24-hour EEG was reassuring \nagainst seizure activity. Hypotension could be related to NPO \nstatus and initiation of low dose amlodipine, although would not \nexpect such a quick response to anti-hypertensive. On review of \nprevious notes and in talking to niece, patient does have \nhistory of possible orthostasis as well as autonomic \ndysfunction, and niece notes several of these similar \nunresponsive episodes at home over the past few months. \nOrthostatic vital signs were positive but did not correct with \nfluid resuscitation and therefore think patient may have some \nunderlying autonomic instability leading to these episodes. Also \nconcern for possible non-convulsive seizure vs post-ictal state \n(which could also lead to autonomic dysfunction) given patient \nhas history of seizures. Patient did not have any incontinence \nor tongue biting. Obtained 24hour EEG which was unremarkable. Of \nnote, her Keppra was dose-adjusted given her persistent ___ and \nthis will need to be monitored as an outpatient. Patient has \nscheduled follow up with neurologist.\n\n# Near fall at home, concern for presyncope\n# History of vasovagal syncope \nPatient presents after a third episode of presyncope. Likely \netiology is combination of dehydration in patient with \nbradycardia on beta blocker. Neurology was consulted in ED and \nmentioned a well-documented h\/o vasovagal\/neurocardio syncope \nbut unclear where this has been documented. Despite seizure hx, \nneuro not concerned for seizure as etiology (previous seizures \nhave occurred iso acute illness eg volvulus\/infection). Unlikely \ninfection given no leukocytosis, afebrile, negative U\/A. \nOrthostatics in ED were reportedly negative. Patient not \nhypoglycemic on admission, although patient is on a sulfonylurea \nso higher risk of low sugars. Patient noted bradycardic with HR \nin ___ on metoprolol, so may have contributed to presentation. \nNo PR prolongation or e\/o heart block on EKG. Last TTE was \n___, had LVEF 30%. Troponin negative. Also was some \nconcern for hypothyroidism given patient always turns AC off per \nniece, but TSH normal. No chest pain or hypoxia to suspect PE. \nPatient at baseline mental status per niece. Patient was \nmonitored on telemetry during stay. TTE was not repeated because \nthought unlikely to be high yield given no murmur on exam. \nPatient's home metoprolol was held as below. \n\n# Bradycardia - NSR in ___, concern for possible symptomatic \nbradycardia as above. No PR prolongation or e\/o heart block on \nEKG. Trop negative, TSH normal. Patient was monitored on tele. \nHome metoprolol was held as patient was likely symptomatic from \nbradycardia. Plan to hold on discharge for patient to discuss \nwith PCP. HR has been stable in 50-60s. \n\n# Hypertension \nPatient hypertensive to 220\/90 upon arrival to the floor, has \nintermittently been so throughout prior admissions. Likely not \nacute, will plan to only lower by ~20% to SBPs 160-170s. IV \nhydralazine 10 x1 with subsequent drop to 90\/50s. Patient's goal \nBP while inpatient was 160-170s\/90s. Home lisinopril 40mg qd was \nheld iso ___. As per above, she was briefly trialed on \nAmlodipine 5mg but the patient became subsequently hypotensive - \nas such, this was discontinued. If remains hypertensive at PCP \nfollow up, consider reinitiation of an anti-hypertensive.\n\nCHRONIC ISSUES: \n=============== \n# Normocytic anemia: Hb 9.2 on admission, at prior baseline. No \nevidence of bleeding. CBC was trended daily and an active T&S \nwas maintained.\n\n# Dementia: At baseline per niece. Patient oriented only to \nself. Answers 'okay' to most questions in ___ and ___. \nPatient continued on home quetiapine (no QTc prolongation on \nadmission ECG).\n\n# Seizure disorder: Patient switched to renal dosing of keppra \n250mg BID (home dose 500mg BID). Neuro consulted, not concerned \nfor seizure on presentation. Had an EEG which was reassuring.\n\n# Chronic, intermittent diarrhea: Symptoms are unchanged as per \npatient's niece. Continued home loperamide prn\n\n# T2DM: Last A1c 7.7% ___. On glipizide at home. Repeat A1c \non admission was 7.5.

CT scan of the neck did not show any \nextraluminal masses compressing. ___ an attempt was made to \nextubate him, but he afterwards developed stridor and had to be \nre-intubated. During the brief extubation, a laryngoscopy was \ndone that was concerning for at least partial paralysis of the \nvocal cords. He was treated with 24 hours of IV solumedrol in \ncase there was a contribution of airway swelling. ___ he had a \ntracheostomy placed by the ENT service with some difficulty \nbecause of his severe scoliosis and altered anatomy. Afterwards \nhe was quickly weaned to a trach collar. With the concomitant \ndysphagia, there was concern for neuromuscular weakness, so \nneurology was consulted.

This was followed by further \nepisodes of ventricular pauses on telemetry, with visible \np-waves concerning for heart block. She then developed atrial \nfibrillation with RVR, rate in 140-150s, requiring ICU transfer \nand metoprolol 2.5 mg IV x 1 ___s diltiazem gtt @ 10 \nmg\/hr. She converted to normal sinus rhythm with PR prolongation \naround 3am of POD # 2.

She had a ___ \nsecond pause in P-wave conductin without ventricular escape \nbeats before transfer to ___. Upon transfer patient was found \nto be in normal sinus rhythm. During her hospitalization she had \ntwo episodes of heartblock, Mobitz II. She did not develop any \nsymptoms of syncope or pre-syncope, chest pain, or shortness of \nbreath. Beta blockers and other nodal agents were avoided. \nPacemaker placement was deferred in the setting of active \ninfection (being treated for pneumonia) the patient's age, and \ngoals of care. She is being discharged with plan for an event \nmonitor and will re-evaluate for pacemaker placement as an \noutpatient once she has cleared her active infection. \n\n# Hypoxemia: \n# Pulmonary edema:\n# Acute on Chronic Heart Failure Exacerbation:   \nPatient presented with a new oxygen requirement up to 4L NC from \nroom air prior to her procedure. She had crackles on exam \nincluding pulmonary edema on CXR. Patient did not have a history \nof known heart failure so it was thought that she flashed in \nsetting of increased IVF and episode of a-fib with RVR after her \nprocedure at ___. Workup at ___ included a proBNP \nof >5000s, and a TTE that showed a depressed LVEF of 40% with \nregional systolic dysfunctdion c\/w CAD (PDA distribution) and \nmoderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation. She was \naggressively diuresed with IV Lasix and subsequently able to \nreduce her oxygen requirement to her baseline of room air. \nRepeat proBNP was 2100 from 5000s. She was transitioned to PO \nTorsemide prior to discharge. Patient was started on Lisinopril \nand Amlodipine for afterload reduction.    \n\n# Hospital Acquired Pneumonia:  \nPrior to transfer from ___, patient developed a \nfever, leukocytosis, new cough, and new oxygen requirement in \nthe post-operative setting. A L basilar opacity was noted on \nchest Xray concerning for hospital acquired pneumonia. Upon \narrival to ___, the patient was started empirically on \nCeftazidime and Vancomycin. Blood cultures and urine cultures \nwere negative. While on antibiotics, the patient's leukocytosis \ntrended down to normal, she remained afebrile, and she \nclinically improved. MRSA swab was negative so Vancomycin was \ndiscontinued. She was then transitioned to PO Levofloxacin prior \nto discharge. The antibiotic course will be completed on ___.  \n\n# CAD: \nDuring workup for pulmonary edema a TTE was performed and showed \na depressed LVEF of 40% with regional systolic dysfunctdion c\/w \nCAD (PDA distribution) and moderate to severe (3+) mitral \nregurgitation with reduced ejection fraction. Due to the \nevidence of CAD on echo she was started on Atorvastatin 40mg and \nASA 81mg. A beta blocker was not started due to her heart block \nas described above. She will follow-up with cardiology as an \noutpatient to determine whether a cath is within her goals of \ncare. \n\n# Hypertension:  \n - Discontinued home carvedilol in the setting of high-grade \nheart block.   \n - Held home valsartan 80 mg PO BID   \n - Started Lisinopril 10mg QDAY on  \n - Started Amlodipine 5mg QDAY on \n\n# S\/p spinal surgery: Pain was well controlled with Tylenol. Per \nher surgeon, Dr. ___ anticoagulation is okay to \nstart on POD ___. His number is ___. The patient \nwas on standard spine precautions with no deep bending or \ntwisting, no lifting greater than 5 lbs. Physical therapy worked \nwith the patient and recommended discharge to rehab. \n\n# AMS: On arrival to ___ the patient was lethargic and \noriented only to person, which was significantly changed from \nher baseline. Her AMS was likely due to infection, hypoxemia \nfrom pulmonary edema, and pain from surgery. The patient's \nunderlying conditions were treated as detailed above and she \nsignificantly improved. Prior to discharge the patient was alert \nand oriented, conversational, and had returned to her baseline \naccording to her family. \n\n# Asthma   \n - Continued Ipratroprium Q6H PRN  \n - Continued Albuterol 2 PUFF q6H PRN  \n\n # Hypothyroidism:  \n - Continued home levothyroxine 50 mcg daily  \n\n # Back pain:  \n - Continued home gabapentin 200 mg PO qHS  \n\n # GERD:  \n - Continued home omeprazole 20 mg PO daily  \n\n====================\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES: \n====================\nMEDICATIONS CHANGED, ADDED, or DISCONTINUED: \n[] Lisinopril 10mg DAILY started for afterload reduction and BP \ncontrol\n[] Amlodipine 5mg started for blood pressure control \n[] Torsemide 10mg every other day started for diuresis in \nsetting of CHF\n[] Potassium Chloride 10meq Daily STARTED. \n\n[] Valsartan 80mg BID, held during hospitalization, consider \nre-continuing once electrolytes and blood pressures stable as \noutpatient \n\n[] Carvedilol. Discontinued, patient should not be on nodal \nagents or beta blockers due to heart block \n\n[] DO NOT start beta blockers or nodal agents due to concern for \nhigh grade Mobitz II heart block. \n\nITEMS REQUIRING FOLLOW-UP: \n[] The patient has required significant potassium and magnesium \nrepletion during diuresis.

There was small amount of \nfresh blood noted around the periampullary area.\nOtherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum\n\nEGD ___:\nNo Varicies seen in the esophagus.\nBlood in the stomach\n___ ulcer was noted extending from hernia sac into the \nproximal aspect of the fundus. An adherent blood clot was noted \nat this area with erythema surrounding the ulcer. (thermal \ntherapy)\nNo ulceration\/bleeding was noted in the deuodenum. Metal stent \narising from the ampulla appeared to be filled with food debris. \nPost ampullary investigation was normal.\nOtherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum\n\nERCP ___\nSmall amount of old blood in the stomach cardia\/fundus \ncompatible with the previously noted ___ ulcer that was \ntreated with cautery. \nThe previous fully covered metal biliary stent was found at the \nmajor papilla having migrated slightly distally into the \nduodenum. \nThis appeared to be occluded by stone debris, and there was \nmalignant-appearing ampullary tissue around the stent. \nGiven the concern for cholangitis, the decision was made to \nremove the metal biliary stent. \nThe previous fully covered metal stent in the biliary duct was \nremoved from the major papilla. \nLimited cholangiogram was performed given the current \ncholangitis. \nFilling defects that appeared like sludge and stone debris were \nseen in the common bile duct. \nMultiple balloon sweeps were performed of the biliary duct with \nremoval of pus, sludge, and stone debris successfully. \nA 10mm x 60mm WallFlex Biliary RX fully covered metal stent was \nplaced successfully in the common bile duct. \nAfter placement it appeared that the distal end of the stent was \nat the level of the ampulla and not completely crossing the \nampullary tissue, so the decision was made to place another \nstent below that crossing the ampulla. \nA 10mm x 40mm WallFlex Biliary RX fully covered metal stent \n(Ref: ___, ___ was placed successfully in the common \nbile duct and across the ampulla.\n\n___ EGD\nImpression:\nMedium hiatal hernia. Many small diffuse angioectasias in the \nantrum and duodenal bulb, likely radiation-induced mucosal \nchanges. Single spot of heme from one angioectasia in the \nstomach antrum, suggesting this as the source of the patient's \nGI bleeding. APC was applied for hemostasis successfully. \nErythema, granularity and congestion of the mucosa in the second \npart of the duodenum. Previous metal stent at the ampulla, with \na small ulceration of the tumor alongside the metal stent. Small \nspot of heme at this area, suggesting this as the source of the \npatient's GI bleeding. APC was applied for hemostasis \nsuccessfully. On withdrawal, a small ___ Tear was \nnoted at the hiatal narrowing, with a small amount of fresh \nblood. There was no active bleeding from the tear, so no therapy \nwas necessary. Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the \nduodenum.\n\nSuccessful EGD with identification and treatment of 2 possible \netiologies for the patient's GI bleeding: ulceration at the \ntumor alongside the indwelling metal stent, and an angioectasia \nin the stomach antrum.

On last admission, \nthere was also concern raised of possibility of pseudoaneurysm \naround head of pancreas which could be source of bleeding as \nwell. Patient was transfused a total of 3u prbcs during his ICU \nstay and appropriately corrected. He was transferred to the \nfloor where he remained hemodynamically stable with no further \nepisodes of melena. He was maintained on PPI BID during hospital \nstay. EGD with duodenoscope showed 2 possible etiologies for the \npatient's GI bleeding: ulceration at the tumor alongside the \nindwelling metal stent, and an angioectasia in the stomach \nantrum. The ___ Tear was unlikely to be the source of \nthe patient's GI bleeding. The patient's Hct was monitored \npost-procedure and was noted to have a slow progressive drop in \nhis Hct. He remained asymptomatic with no further symptoms and \nwas transfused 2 units prior to discharge.

She also had 3 events in the\nemergency department, two of which were characterized by \nrigidity\nwith some bilateral arm movement, lasting 30 seconds. There was\nno apparent postictal period, no oral trauma, and no bowel or\nbladder incontinence.  The last episode consisted of 30 seconds\nof staring into space, which resolved.  It also appears that she\nhad withdrawal to light shining in her eyes during 1 of these\nepisodes.  She did receive 2 mg IV Ativan for these episodes.\nWork-up included positive cocaine in urine.\n\nPlan initially was to admit for EEG, but hospitalist declined, \nas\nhe felt that cvEEG would be more appropriate.

At that time, her toxicology screen was positive for\nbuprenorphine, cocaine, and cannabinoids, and blood alcohol \nlevel\nwas 226.  During that hospitalization, patient had to be\nintubated for agitation post-Ativan.  Workup included a head CT\n(normal) and a 20-minute EEG which was normal, but did not\ncapture any events.  She was evaluated by neurology at that \ntime,\nand they increased her lamotrigine to 100 mg twice a day. \n\nIt appears that the neurology consult team thought that it was\nlikely that at least some of the seizures could be in the \nsetting\nof substance use, and that some episodes were also likely to be\nnonepileptic.  \n\nOf note, it is somewhat unclear what AEDs patient is supposed to\nbe taking.

He was started on a heparin drip. IV metoprolol did \nnot seem to affect heart rate, so patient was also started on \ndiltiazem drip.  \n\n___ cardiology suggested likely DCCV in AM. Transfer vitals \nwere  \n97.9 ___ 14 97% .  \n\nOn my interview, the patient confrims recent ablation, followed \nby feeling \"crummy\" in the days following, which he had \nattributed to anesthesia. On ___, he saw his cardiologist, \nand EKG was fine. Today at work, he began to experience \npalpitations and a feeling of lightheadedness. He then had a \nsensation of heat in the face, more palpitations and a possible \nevent of syncope or near to it. After reporting to ___ for \nEKG, the patient went home again but then had another spell--he \ndid not pass out but felt as though he were close to doing so. \nSince he would be home alone, he decided to come in to the \nhospital. Here he has had no such episodes but has only been \nquietly reading in bed. Telemetry has showed runs of up to one \nminute of VT, though that seems to have stopped with \nadministration of fleicanide. Rate also appears to be better \ncontrolled with diltiazem drip at 7.5mg.  \n \nCardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, \ndyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, \nankle edema.  \n \nPast Medical History:\nHistory of Basal cell carcinoma\nHistory of Colonic Adenoma\nAtrial Fibrillation\nHypertension\nErectile dysfunction\nBenign prostatic hypertrophy\nNon ischemic cardiomyopathy\n\n \nSocial History:\n___\nFamily History:\nNo family history of early MI, arrhythmia, cardiomyopathies, or \nsudden cardiac death; Father ___ from ___ (___).

Patient is having symptoms consistent with return \nto atrial fibrillation\/flutter. He has been hemodynamically \nstable during this hospitalization.   As INR subtherapeutic and \nprocedure was initially being considered, patient was started on \nheparin gttWe consulted EP in morning after the patient was \nadmitted.  Their recommendation was to medically manage with \nsotalol and serial EKGs to monitor for prolonged QT.  We \ntherefore discontinued the diltiazem gtt in the setting of \nbrady-arrhythmias on telemetry.  The patient remained \nasymptomatic throughout this hospitalization.  We continued home \nwarfarin and closely followed ___.  The patient was \nstarted on 80mg BID of sotalol, monitored for QT prolongation \n(QTc's of 0.47-0.48), which were WNL and on the morning of \ndischarge the patient's dose was escalated to 120mg BID, and \nagain monitored for QT prolongation; QTc prior to discharge was \n0.46. \n.\n# CORONARIES: The patient has no known history of \nhyperlipidemia.  We continued the patient on his home dose of \naspirin.  \n. \n# PUMP: The patient has mildly depressed systolic function on \nlast echocardiogram.  We continued the patient on his home dose \nof lisinopril. We initially held the patient's metoprolol in the \nsetting of diltiazem gtt.  The diltiazem drip was discontinued \nafter roughly 8 hours in order to begin rate control therapy \nwith sotalol.   \n. \n# HYPERTENSION: Continue home lisinopril. Holding metoprolol in \nthe setting of sotalol.  Given the patient's borderline \nbradycardia, we held the metoprolol at discharge, with the \npatient to follow up with his cardiologist about possibly \nrestarting the metoprolol in the future.\n.\n[]TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\n-patient discharged with holter monitor\n-patient will f\/u with Dr. ___ \n \n___ on Admission:\nPreadmission medications listed are correct and complete.  \nInformation was obtained from Patient.\n1.

He \ncompleted the ___ 21 hour protocol. He was asymptomatic from the \nstandpoint of this ingestion, and he continued to deny that it \nwas a suicide attempt. He was evaluated by psychiatry, who did \nnot feel as though he was a suicide risk on this admission. \n\n# S\/P assault, throat and back pain: He reported improvement in \nhis left upper extremity strength, which he had initially noted \nto be decreased after the assault. MRI of the C-spine and \nT-spine did not demonstrate any evidence of cord compression or \nother structural abnormality to account for these symptoms. \nAdditionally, he reported persistent change in his voice and \ndifficulty swallowing liquids after being attacked and struck on \nhis neck. The patient was not noted by staff to be aspirating \nliquids or solids during his stay. The patient remained \nconcerned over the presence of a lumbar vertebral fracture. We \noffered to evaluate the lumbar spine with plain films, given his \nhistory of chronic low back pain exacerbated in the setting of \nrecent assault, but he declined as he felt the team would not \nchange their opinions. Of note, he became agitated and \naggressive towards staff when we refused to provide a \nprescription for narcotic pain medication upon discharge. \n\n# Drug seeking behavior\nThis decision to attempt to avoid narcotic medications was aided \nby discussion with his PCP (Dr. ___ at ___ \n___) who reported that he had previously sought out \nadditional narcotic pain medications following the amputation of \nhis toe on the right foot (___). She reports that he \nuntruthfully claimed to have not been given any pain medication \nupon discharge following this surgery in ___, and so she \nprescribed a small number of narcotic pain pills. She later \nreceived a call from his pharmacy, stating that he had in fact \nreceived narcotics from his surgeon, and had attempted to fill \nher prescription as well. This account, coupled with his \nbehavior surrounding this issue, raised concerns for \ndrug-seeking behavior on this admission. Additionally, he admits \nto using 3+ different pharmacies, and has multiple PCP's who he \nhas seen over the last year. During the admission process, in \nattempting to reconcile his home medications, we received \nmultiple very different lists of current medications from the \npatient, his multiple pharmacies, and his PCP of record, Dr. \n___. As a result, it was very difficult to reconcile his \nmedications, and the final list is correct to the best of our \nknowledge. He was discharged with a prescription for Ultram for \ncontrol of back pain s\/p assault. \n\n# Hypertension: Well controlled on this admission. He was \ncontinued on his home regimen of labetalol. \n\n# HLD: Stable.

She developed hypotension and was transferred to the \nMICU and underwent EGD on ___ which showed bleeding ulcer \nvs mass in duodenum. Bleeding could not be controlled \nendoscopically and she was intubated and taken to ___ for \nemergent embolization of the GDA with coils and gelfoam. They \ndid not identify active extravasation during ___ procedure. She \nwas extubated ___ following further hemodynamic \nstabilization. \n\nAt that time, she requested no further procedures and strict \nDNR\/DNI in discussion with the medical team and her family. She \ndeclared her wishes not to be rehospitalized, with the ultimate \ngoal of gaining enough strength at rehab to return home. Despite \nconcern for malignancy, no further workup is desired by the \npatient. \n\nShe remained hemodynamically stable and was maintained on IV \nthen PO PPI. \n- H. pylori Ab pending at time of discharge and would initiate \ntreatment if positive, otherwise continue PPI\n- Restarted aspirin upon discharge\n\n# Abdominal pain: Likely in the setting of GI bleed. CT \nabdomen\/pelvis by GI did not show evidence of mesenteric \nischemia but did show findings consistent with gastroenteritis. \nRUQ U\/S showed gallstones but no acute process with normal \nhepatoechogeneity. Hepatitis panels were concerning for prior \nHepB infection given positive HepBcAb. Since arrival to the MICU \npatient's abdominal pain improved but has intermittent pain \ntreated with Maalox and PPI. \n- H. pylori Ab pending at time of discharge and would initiate \ntreatment if positive, otherwise continue PPI\n\n#Hypotension: Pt became hypotensive shortly following admission, \nwhich was thought to be multifactorial in etiology, with \ncontributions from heavy beta blockade and acute blood loss. \nThere were no signs or symptoms to suggest infection \n(asymptomatic, afebrile, no leukocytosis, BCx NGTD). \nAdditionally, pt initially started on ciprofloxacin\/flagyl, but \ndiscontinued due to low index of suspicion for infection. During \nher stay in the MICU, her BP improved back to SBP 130's-140's \nand she was restarted on increased metoprolol in setting of new \nafib and home furosemide dose. Home lisinopril was held. \n- please check BPs daily and if greater than 160\/90 please start \nlisinopril 10mg daily\n\n# Atrial fibrillation with RVR: Atrial fibrillation was newly \nrecognized on admission, possibly precipitated by acute blood \nloss. Rate control was complicated by acute hypotension and \nmetoprolol was restarted and advanced. CHADS2 Score is 3, \nTTE showed LV systolic dysfunction (EF=35%) w\/inferior wall \nakinesis but no evidence of thrombus. Anticoagulation was not \nstarted given her GI bleed and goals of care.\n- Please monitor HR carefully, would uptitrate metoprolol \nsuccinate slowly if HR persistently above 110bpm \n\n# Respiratory Failure: Patient was intubated in setting of EGD \nand ___ angiography. Pt was extubated shortly following the \nprocedure without any further respiratory issues. She does \nrequire 2LNC and should be weaned as tolerated.  She does desat \nto low 80's when off supplemental oxygen. \n\n# Transaminitis: Transaminases were initially normal on \nadmission then found to be newly elevated during her stay in the \nMICU. RUQ U\/S showed stones in gallbladder but was not \nconcerning for acute biliary process. Viral serologies showed HB \nimmune, and HAV immune. Pt denied further work-up for malignancy \nas above. \n\nCHRONIC ISSUES:\n# Compensated systolic\/diastolic heart failure: Pt was restarted \non beta-blockade while in the MICU as above.

Despite constipation, there was little \nsuspicion for obstruction, given continued flatus and \nnontympanitic abdomen. In the setting of self-reported history \nof ischemic colitis and later C. difficile infection, recurrent \nischemic colitis was felt to be similarly unlikely in the \nabsence of postprandial pain or hematochezia while absence of \ndiarrhea essentially precluded C. difficile colitis. Lipase and \nurinalysis were unremarkable on admisssion. Gastrointestinal \nsymptoms had largely resolved and she was tolerating oral intake \nby the time of discharge.   \n\n(2)Addison's disease: Cosyntropin stimulation test performed \nafter home steroid regimen was held for approximately 24 hours \nwas consistent with adrenal insufficiency, possibly iatrogenic; \nher phenotype was felt by the endocrine service to be \ninconsistent with Addison's disease in the absence of skin \nchanges, suppression of axillary hair growth, or objective \nweakness. She declined further evaluation, including pituitary \nMRI, in-house and was discharged on her home \nglucocorticoid\/mineralocorticoid replacement regimen. She \nremained hemodynamically stable with normal electrolytes \nthroughout admission.\n\n(3)Sinus bradycardia: She was found to be intermittently \nasymptomatically bradycardic to ___ on telemetry, nadiring at 46 \non a single EKG. Despite reported history of QT prolongation, \nQTc remained 410s-450s on multiple EKGs over the course of \nadmission, and electrolytes were repleted as needed. Cardiac \nevent monitor may be considered in the outpatient setting.\n\n(4)Syncope: She experienced no recurrent syncopal episodes \nin-house without evidence of arrhythmia or other clear \nabnormalities on multiple EKGs. There were no events, with the \nexception of intermittent asymptomatic sinus bradycardia, on \ntelemetry, and recent outside hospital electroencephalogram was \nnegative for seizure activity. Although there was no orthostatic \nhypotension, she did display postural tachycardia and may \nbenefit from autonomics evaluation in the outpatient setting.\n\n(5)Leukocytosis: Leukocytosis to 13.4-14.2 was likely due to \ndemargination following stress-dose hydrocortisone. She remained \nafebrile and hemodynamically stable without localizing \nsigns\/symptoms clearly attributable to infection, and \nleukocytosis resolved without dedicated intervention by the time \nof discharge. Urinalysis was negative.\n\nInactive Issues:\n(1)Posttraumatic stress disorder: Home sertraline was continued \nthroughout admission.\n\nTransitional Issues:\n- Pituitary MRI is advised in the outpatient setting.\n- Cardiac event monitor may be considered in the outpatient \nsetting for further evaluation of bradycardia and syncopal \nepisodes.\n- Autonomics evaluation may be considered in the outpatient \nsetting for further evaluation of postural tachycardia.\n- Pending studies: TTG, ACTH, aldosterone levels.\n- Code status: Full.\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

She described losing her step \nupon getting out of bed, and had symptoms of lightheadedness at \nthe time. She denied any loss of consciousness. For her \northostatic hypotension, patient at baseline is on midodrine. It \nis possible that ___ midodrine in combination with her \nbeta blocker and lisinopril is contributing to her orthostatic \nhypotension. Patient is on chronic pred 5mg for PMR and there \nwas initially a concern for possible adrenal insufficiency but \nthis was ruled out (see below for more information). Patient \nalso has peripheral neuropathy, and poor ambulatory function at \nbaseline, both of which causes her gait to be unsteady as well. \nPatient denied any prior history of sudden LOC to suggest \ncardiac etiology. She also denied any palpitations or chest \nsymptoms. She was monitored on tele without any notable cardiac \nevents. Patient has a history of AF but remained in SR while she \nwas hospitalized. There was no physical exam findings to suggest \naortic stenosis. Hence, overall there is a low suspicion for \nstructural heart disease. She denied any prior seizure history \nand was not post-ictal after her fall. ___ BP was in \n120s-140s\/60s-70s prior to discharge and she was not \northostatic. All together, we believe patient suffered a fall in \nthe setting of being on midodrine, and antihypertensives \n(lisinopril, metoprolol), in combination with poor \nbalance\/peripheral neuropathy at baseline. Patient was continued \non home midodrine on discharge, and after a discussion with her \nPCP, ___ lisinopril was discontinued and metoprolol \ndecreased to 25mg XL daily. Patient will follow-up with PCP to \ndetermine whether she should have any other adjustments to her \nmedication doses.\n\n#R\/o adrenal insufficiency: Patient is on chronic pred 5mg for \nPMR, and in the process of working up for her fall, an AM \ncortisol returned at 1.1. This was likely artifact. We obtained \na repeat cortisol, which returned as 15 and is more consistent \nwith prior cortisol levels in our system. This repeat cortisol \nlevel was also drawn at a more appropriate time of the day. \nGiven that patient did not have any orthostasis, without sodium \nor glucose abnormalities, and absence of other adrenal \ninsufficiency symptoms, this level is likely a laboratory error. \nPatient was able to ambulate without any dizziness or other \nsymptoms. This questionable cortisol result was communicated \nwith outpatient PCP via phone call, who agreed that it is likely \na non-issue. We continued patient back on home prednisone for \nher PMR upon discharge. \n\n#Acute blood loss anemia: Patient developed acute blood loss \nanemia in the setting of her fall and developing a large R flank \nhematoma. Hgb on discharge was 7.6 (baseline ___. She did \nnot have any active evidence of bleeding on discharge, and her \nCT did not show any active extravasation. Patient will follow-up \nwith her PCP, and should have her CBC repeated as an outpatient.\n\n#R flank\/extrathoracic hematoma: Patient suffered a fall and \ndeveloped a large R flank hematoma. A CT scan showed the \nflank\/extrathoracic hematoma was 18 x 12 x 4.3cm without any \nevidence of active extravasation. This was progressively \nresolving and improved at the time discharge. \n\n#L radial fracture, R midshaft clavicle fracture: Patient with \nfractures from prior fall in ___ and is s\/p by ortho. Per \northo, ___ fractures are healing well and is best managed \nnon-operatively. Per ortho, patient can be WBAT for LUE and RUE. \nShe will follow-up in outpatient orthopedics clinic. \n\n#PMR: ___ PMR was stable during this inpatient \nhospitalization. We continued ___ home prednisone on \ndischarge. \n\n#DMII: Patient was treated with ISS while inpatient with sugar \nlevels remaining largely at goal. She was resumed on her \noutpatient DM regimen upon discharge.\n\n#GERD: We continued patient on home omeprazole.\n\n===============================================================\nTransitional Issues:\n1. Please follow-up on ___ orthostatic hypotension. After \ndiscussing with her primary care physician, ___ \ndiscontinued her lisinopril, decreased her metoprolol to 25mg XL \ndaily and continued her home midodrine.\n2. Please follow-up on her acute blood loss anemia and repeat \nCBC during primary care appointment. Hgb on discharge was 7.6. \n3. Please follow-up regarding her ACTH level (pending on \ndischarge). Note that this was sent due to low cortisol (1.1), \nbut the 1.1 was likely a lab error as the repeat cortisol level \nwas 15. \n4. Please follow-up regarding the healing of her L radial and R \nclavicle fractures. \n\n# CODE: Full Code \n# CONTACT: Daughter, ___ ___ \n\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

Coombs positive (IgG+). Spherocytes on\nperipheral smear. Unclear whether there is a precipitating \ncause,\nthough it is suspicious that it is occurring in the setting of \nso\nmany other lab abnormalities (as below). Now stablizlied around\nhemoglobin of 9. Hematology initially considered prednisone but \ndeferred ultimately given stabilization. Hematology will reach \nout to patient to setup outpatient follow-up appointment. \nTorsemide was held on admission which has a sulfa-moiety. There \nis a small possibility this was the precipitating factor in his \nhemolytic anemia therefore if patient requires diuresis upon \ndischarge would either use ethacrynic acid or monitor counts \nwith resumption of Torsemide. \n-Discharge Weight 85kg (dry weight). \n-Either resume diuresis with ethaycrynic acid or monitor for \nrecurrent hemolytic anemia if using sulfa-based loop diuretic \n-Will need cardiology f\/u \n-Hematology f\/u (they will call patient)\n\n#Bilateral Lower Leg Weakness\n#Polyradiculopathy\n#Falls\/unsteady gait\n#Concern for Myelopathy\/myositis \nNeurology and neurosurgery both consulted per neurology \nassessment\n\nNeurological examination revealed diffuse, distally-predominant\nlower extremity weakness, decreased reflexes except at the left\npatella, and pan-modal sensory deficits in the distal lower\nextremities. MRI of the spine demonstrated multi-level\ndegenerative disc disease associated with severe canal and\nforaminal stenosis in the lumbar spine. Serum studies have been\nnotable for hematological abnormalities, elevated inflammatory\nmarkers, and elevated CK and LFTs that are tending toward \nnormal.\n\nThe degenerative changes in the lumbosacral spine could \ncertainly\nbe playing a prominent role in the lower extremity weakness. The\nquickly and spontaneously normalizing CKs (even while on a\nstatin) seem to point away from a primary muscle process (e.g.\ninclusion body myositis). \n \nNEUROLOGY RECOMMENDATIONS:\n- follow clinically\n- nerve conduction studies\/electromyography could be helpful, \nand\nmay be done on an outpatient basis (will be arranged by \nneurology)\n- obtain bilateral ankle-foot orthotics \n- fall precautions\n- rehab\n- Neurosurgery consulted recommended lumbar decompression \npreviously recommended at ___, is quite certain he does \nnot want surgical intervention at this time. Surgical planning \nfurther complicated by DAPT post DES recently. \n\n#LFT elevation \n#Concern for Myelopathy\n#Elevated CK- Improving without intervention save for change \nfrom Atorvastatin to rousavstatin. ___ be secondary to \nhemolysis.Perhaps acute viral illness or resolving rhabdo vs. \nresolving myositis. CK and LFTs were normalizing on discharge. \n-Patient offered lumbar decompression but he does not feel\nsurgery is within his goals of care at this time \n- Send labs for polyradiculopathy w\/u: B12, Lyme serologye \n(negative), ___ (pending)\nTSH, SPEP\/UPEP (negative), RPR (negative), HIV (negative), A1c \n(6.4), Hepatitis serologies (negative or immune)\n- EMG\/NCS - neurology will arrange outpatient study\n\n#Elevated Transaminases\nUnclear etiology. Improving. No obvious abnormalities on RUQUS \nor\nCT abd\/pelvis. Possibly statin-induced. Of note, hemolysis\nfalsely elevates AST, ALT, CK. Improving today. \n-Trend LFTs\n-Switch atorvastatin 80 mg to rosuvastatin 20 mg\n-F\/U hepatitis serologies\n-obtain CK-MB fraction (add on) \n\n#Acute kidney failure\nImproved with IVF in the ED, so likely a pre-renal component.\nTrue baseline is not clear at this point. Improved. \n-Trend Cr\n-Held torsemide 30mg daily on discharge (discharge Cre 1.4) \n-Encourage good PO intake with gentle IVF boluses as needed\n\n#Concern for GI bleed\nAnemia likely entirely explained by hemolysis. EGD without\nevidence of bleeding. Patient needs outpatient colonoscopy \n(never\nhad colonoscopy before), which has been scheduled for ___ at\n1pm per GI team.\n\nCHRONIC\/STABLE PROBLEMS:\n\n#CAD s\/p recent STEMI with PCI\n#sCHF (EF 26%)\nTroponin and BNP both less than previous baselines.

There is mild symmetric left \nventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and \nregional\/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). The estimated \ncardiac index is normal (>=2.5L\/min\/m2). Right ventricular \nchamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve \nleaflets are moderately thickened. There is mild aortic valve \nstenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2). No aortic regurgitation is \nseen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate \n(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary \nartery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. \n\nIMPRESSION: Mild aortic valve stenosis. Pulmonary artery \nsystolic hypertension. Moderate mitral regurgitation.No definite \ncardiac source of embolism identified.\n\nMRI\/MRA head\/neck ___:\n MRI-head IMPRESSION: \nAcute\/subacute ischemic event identified on the left basal \nganglia, apparently extending superiorly at the caudate nucleus. \nScattered foci of high-signal intensity, and restricted \ndiffusion are noted on the DWI sequences likely consistent with \na thromboembolic ischemic event. \n MRA-head IMPRESSION: \nMild-to-moderate arteriosclerotic disease is identified in the \nleft posterior cerebral artery as described above. No evidence \nof aneurysms larger than 2 mm in size. The left vertebral artery \nis dominant. \n MRA-neck IMPRESSION: \nSignificant stenosis identified on the right cervical \nbifurcation involving the origin of the internal carotid artery, \ncorrelation with carotid ultrasound or CTA are recommended. \nThere is also irregular contour at the cervical bifurcation on \nthe left, possibly consistent with moderate stenosis. Irregular \ncontour of the right vertebral artery, possibly related with \nhypoplasia versus atherosclerotic disease. \n\nNCHCT ___:\nEvolving left basal ganglia infarct without evidence of \nintracranial hemorrhage.\n\nCT-angiogram of the chest (PE-protocol) ___:\nIMPRESSION: \n1. No evidence of PE. \n2. Extensive mucus plugging and impaction of the right lower \nlobe bronchus and bronchus intermedius with atelectasis of the \nright lower lobe. Scattered calcifications in the area of this \nbronchus are also noted. Evaluation for underlying lesion is \nlimited due to the extensive secretions. Bronchoscopy is \nrecommended for further evaluations. \n3. Pulmonary nodules as described above measuring up to 4 mm. \nRepeat chest CT within six months is recommended to document \nstability. \n4. Small right pleural effusion. \n5. Moderate emphysema. \n6. Extensive coronary artery disease. \n7. Renal hypodense lesions, some of which represent a simple \ncyst and others which are incompletely characterized but may \nrepresent hemorrhagic cyst. Renal ultrasound is recommended for \nfurther evaluation. \n8. Hiatal hernia. \n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nICU Course:\n \nMrs. ___ exam on arrival in the ICU was somewhat worse \nthan her admission examination: The right arm was weaker and \ndysarthria was dramatic. Nonetheless, her neurologic examination \nagain improved rapidly over the following 24 hours. Other issues \nin the ICU included some respiratory distress, necessitating \nhumidified air delivery by shovel-nose mask and likely related \nto underlying COPD on a 90-pack-year history of smoking. Given \ncopious secretions and poor clearance, food was initially held, \nbut she passed swallow assessment at 36 hours and was started \nwith a diet of ground solid and thin liquids. \n\n*****\n\nFloor\/SDU course:\n\nPatient arrived to our SDU overnight ___ on ___ 11, with \npoor respiratory status on exam the following morning ___. She \nwas hypoxic to 90% SaO2 and tachypneic to the ___ on exam, \nwith no air movement at both bases, right worse than left, and \nmild tachycardia to ___, quite uncomfortable\/dyspneic on \n10L face-tent. PaO2 on ABG was 60mmHg (pH 7.42, PaCO2 46). A \nPE-protocol chest CTA was obtained, and did not show any PEs, \nbut did reveal RLL bronchus obstruction with RLL collapse \n(expalining the atalectatic lung seen on prior CXRs). \nPulmonology did not wish to bronch patient in the acute setting \nand recommended follow-up as an outpatient. Given the patient's \nextensive and on-going smoking history, this obstructive \/ \ncalcified mass may represent a primary lung malignancy.\n\nShe was continued on her IV Vancomycin (already receiving this \ndue to RLE cellulitis which was minimally improved on \ncephalosporin Tx; also, she was MRSA+ on nasal screening swab) \nand started on IV Zosyn for empiric HCAP coverage. Her albuterol \nand ipratropium nebulizer treatments were switched from PRN to \nstanding q6h. She remained afebrile and with no leukocytosis \nthroughout her stay, and her tachypnea and oxygen requirements \nimproved gradually over the next few days. Blood cultures from \nadmission remained no growth from ___.

They discussed \nlifestyle modifications with him (small meals, not eating before \nbed, raising head of bed). Patient got azithromycin and \nceftriaxone in the hospital, discharged on levofloxacin for at \ntotal of 7 days of antibiotics. He initially required 3L of O2 \nby nasal cannula but on discharge spo2 was 92-93% at rest and \nwhile ambulating on RA without symptoms of dyspnea. We continued \nto treat his hypertension and GERD with his home medications. Of \nnote, patient also appeared to have a UTI on admission based on \nresults of his UA which showed leuk esterase, WBCs, bacteria, \nand RBCs (however was asx and culture was negative).

Recommend it is followed up and if weight loss \ncontinues then undergo further workup in outpatient setting.\n\n#Proteinuria\/bacteruria\nPatient had +leuk, protein, bacteria, and WBCs in urine at time \nof admission. Culture was negative but if sample was from after \npatient received ceftriaxone then we would expect a negative \nculture. Repeat UA showed small leuk esterase, 15 WBCs, and 8 \nRBCS which is significantly better than his prior UA. Presuming \npt had a UTI that is improving with ceftriaxone.

He was sitting in traffic somewhere near ___ around 6pm and he was wearing his seatbelt. He does not\nremember anything from then until partial memories of riding in\nthe ambulance to our hospital, where he says he felt \"hazy\" and\nremembers being \"combative\" with the EMS staff.

She underwent ERCP \nwith successful and well tolerated plastic stent removal and \nmetal stent placement. LFTs subsequently downtrended. She \ntolerated advancement of diet. Abdominal pain improved.\n- Continue to trend LFTs\n- Monitor for signs of cholangitis or worsening biliary \nobstruction including fevers, chills, nausea\/vomiting, \nintolerance of PO, abdominal pain\n\n# Pancreatic cancer causing\n# Abdominal pain - Related to mass effect from pancreatic tumor. \nShe underwent celiac plexus neurolysis with the ERCP team. She \ndid well after this, denied any significant pain or nausea on \nthe day of discharge.\n- No additional pain medications prescribed at discharge\n\n# Coagulopathy - INR 4 on admission, most likely in setting of \npoor nutritional\nstatus from weight loss and malignancy; primary liver issue (due \nto metastases) was considered but she demonstrated brisk and \nlasting response to intravenous vitamin K with FFP prior to \nprocedure. She received Vitamin K 5mg PO, 5mg IV, and FFP prior \nto procedure.\n- Continue to monitor\n- Consider further workup, possibly low dose vitamin K \nsupplementation if this becomes a recurrent issue; could query \nmalabsorption due to obstruction and consider Creon.\n\n# Anemia - No signs of acute blood loss. Hct downtrend noted \npre-procedure so unlikely related to the procedure itself, and \nno bleeding noted during procedure (no sphincterotomy required). \nShe was given IVF overnight so lower Hct this AM likely \nreflecting some dilution. Underlying mechanism of chronic anemia \nis likely inflammation in setting of cancer.\n- Outpatient CBC monitoring with further workup dependent on \ntrend\n\n# Stage IV Pancreatic cancer: According to her Oncolgy team, \nultimately there is a plan for chemo with palliative intent once \njaundice is under control.

Suggestion\nof mild thickening involving portions of the pouch is noted, \nlikely reflective\nof patient's prior history of episodes of pouchitis with mild \nthickening along\nthe ileocolonic anastomosis site (2:68), more likely related to\nunderdistension than active disease.\n \nCT OF THE PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS AND ORAL CONTRAST: The urinary \nbladder\nappears unremarkable. No pathologically enlarged pelvic sidewall \nor inguinal\nlymph nodes are identified.\n \nBONE WINDOWS: Mild symmetric increased sclerosis about the SI \njoints is seen\nwith some cortical irregularity along the posterior aspect of \nthe joint,\nsuggestive of erosive disease. No malignant-appearing osseous \nlesions are\nidentified with multiple hemangiomas noted within the spine as \nwell as\nprominent Schmorl's node formation at L2-L3, some abnormal \ndiffuse periosteal\nnew bone formation is also noted along the anterior aspect of \nthe sacrum which\nmay reflect some underlying enthesopathy.\n \nIMPRESSION:\n1. Post-surgical changes from subtotal colectomy with no \nfindings of intra-\nabdominal abscess or overt findings of active Crohn's disease. \nSome\nthickening along the ileocolonic anastomosis and pouch may \nreflect sequelae of\nprior episodes of inflammation\/pouchitis.\n \n2. IBD associated SI joint arthropathy with erosive changes \nbilaterally.\n \n3. Probable splenic hemangioma\n\n- CHEST (PA & LAT)Study Date of ___ 4:06 ___\nFINDINGS: No previous images. The heart is normal in size and \nlungs are\nclear without vascular congestion or pleural effusion. \nSpecifically, no\nevidence radiographically of old tuberculosis.\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ year old man with a likely diagnosis of Crohn's s\/p subtotal \ncolectomy with pouch, history of pouchitis, with recent anal \nfistula repair in ___ at ___ who presents with three weeks of \njoint pain.\n\n# Inflammatory bowel disease, possibly Crohn's: On admission, \nthe patient was noted to have elevated CRP\/ESR, as well as \nfindings on physical exam consistent with enthesitis. He did not \nnote any findings of a GI flare of Crohn's, such as increasing \nfrequency of stool, abdominal pain, or increased blood in the \nstool. The first two days of his hospitalization he required \nhigh doses of IV dilaudid for pain control, but upon discharge \nhad only occasionally required PO oxycodone for pain control. \nUpon review of the medical records from both ___ \n___ (where his colectomy was originally performed) as well \nas Pathology reports from ___, there appeared to be pathologic \nfindings such as transmural inflammation and wall thickening, \nperforation and pseudopolyp formation on biopsy. In addition, \nthe patient's recent anal fistula repair also suggests \ntransmural inflammation leading to fistula formation, more \nconsistent with Crohn's disease, although he presents with a \ndiagnosis of ulcerative colitis. Based on this belief that the \npatient has Crohn's disease, the GI team recommended started \nSulfasalzine 1000 mg BID, with a plan for the outpatient \ninitiation of Remicade therapy. The patient was prepped for \npossible Remicade therapy with PPD placement, and the drawing of \nHepatitis serologies (which are still pending). The patient \nindicated that he wished to be followed by Dr. ___ at ___, \nand has an appointment with Dr. ___ on ___ attempts \nwere made to make this appointment earlier. A CXR performed to \nrule out TB did not show any evidence of TB. A CT of the abdomen \nand pelvis to rule out infection prior to the start of \nanti-TNFalpha therapy only showed post-surgical changes from \nsubtotal colectomy with no findings of intra-abdominal abscess \nor overt findings of active Crohn's disease. There was some \nthickening along the ileocolonic anastomosis and pouch there \nwere thought to reflect sequelae of prior episodes of \ninflammation\/pouchitis. The patient also had IBD associated SI \njoint arthropathy with erosive changes bilaterally, as well as \nan incidental findings of a probable splenic hemangioma. The \npatient was otherwise continued on his home regimen of rectal \nhydrocortisone and mesalamine. Charcot ___ crystal were seen \nin the patient's stool studies, which were either pending or \nnegative on discharge, but O&P was negative x 3, and crystal \nwere felt to be more likely from chronic GI blood loss or IBD \ninflammation as opposed to a parasitic infection.  \n\n# Enthesitis: The patient's description of his pain does not \nsounds very joint related, but on exam appears to be more \nassociated with a tendopathy or an enthesitis. Rheumatology was \nconsulted, and agreed the pain was likely IBD associated \nspondyloarthropathy, and recommended starting treatment with \nsulfazalaine, with a possible need to start IV steroids and \nother immunomodulatory therapy. The patient's pain was initially \ncontrolled with IV Dilaudid, subsequently converted to PO \noxycodone. Rheumatology follow-up was made within the month, \nwith a particular focus on the findings on CT of IBD associated \nSI joint arthropathy with erosive changes bilaterally. \n\n# Pouchitis: The patient has a history of pouchitis, which \nsounds as though it has been present since ___, and \nthat he has been off and on antibiotics since that time. His \nurine culture and U\/A were negative for infection, and blood \ncultures were pending at the time of his discharge, but were \nnegative to date. His stool cultures were all negative as \ndescribed in the Microbiology section of results. He was \ndischarged on his home dose of Cipro and Flagyl.\n\n# Microcytic anemia: Iron studies show a profound microcytic \niron deficiency anemia, despite the PO supplementation with TID \niron. The patient was trialed on a x 1 dose of 750 mg iron, \nwhich he appeared to tolerate well; however, given his profound \nanemia, as well as his likely lack of iron absorption, it was \ndeferred as an outpatient to consider the initiation of IV iron \ntherapy. B12 and folate studies were within normal limits. \n\n# Thrombocytosis: Etiologies include possibly essential \nthrombocytosis, although patient does not have an increase in \nRBCs or granulocytes, or a reactive thrombocytosis, such as from \ninfection, or acute bleeding. Given the patient's known history \nof IBD, his thrombyctosis was felt likely reactive from \ninflammation of his known disease.\n\nTransitional Issues:\n- Please have PPD of right forearm read on ___\n- Please follow-up Hepatitis A, B, and C serologies (drawn in \norder to rule out liver disease prior to start of anti-TNFalpha \ntherapy)\n- Please consider the initiation of IV iron therapy given the \nlow levels of iron and ferritin despite several months of high \ndose iron supplementation\n- Please follow up final blood cultures x 2\n- Please provide patient with referral to Rheumatology\n- Please provide coordination and labs\/studies to patient's IBD \nspecialist once established (either at ___ or at ___\n \nMedications on Admission:\n- Ciprofloxacin 500 mg BID\n- Flagyl 500 mg BID\n- Mesalamine-Cleansing Wipes (ROWASA) 4 gram\/60 mL Rectal Kit 1 \nenema nightly\n- Oxycodone-Acetaminophen (ENDOCET) ___ mg Oral: ___ Q6H PRN \nPain\n- Hydrocortisone Acetate 10% Rectal Foam at bedtime\n- Iron 1 tablet TID\n- Multivitamin 1 tablet daily\n- Cholestyramine 4 g daily \n \nDischarge Medications:\n1. ciprofloxacin 500 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO twice a \nday.  \n2. metronidazole 500 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 \ntimes a day).  \n3. mesalamine 4 gram\/60 mL Enema Sig: Four (4) grams Rectal HS \n(at bedtime).  \n4. oxycodone-acetaminophen ___ mg Tablet Sig: ___ Tablets PO \nevery six (6) hours as needed for pain.  \n5. hydrocortisone acetate 10 % (80 mg) Foam Sig: One (1) Appl \nRectal QHS (once a day (at bedtime)).  \n6. multivitamin     Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily). \n \n7. cholestyramine-sucrose 4 gram Packet Sig: One (1) Packet PO \nDAILY (Daily).  \n8. psyllium     Packet Sig: One (1) Packet PO BID (2 times a \nday).  \n9. sulfasalazine 500 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO BID (2 \ntimes a day).\nDisp:*120 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*\n10. ferrous sulfate 300  mg (60 mg iron) Tablet Sig: One (1) \nTablet PO TID (3 times a day).  \n\n \nDischarge Disposition:\nHome\n \nDischarge Diagnosis:\nPrimary Diagnosis:\n- Crohn's Disease\n \nDischarge Condition:\nMental Status: Clear and coherent.\nLevel of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.\nActivity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.","summary":"You were admitted because you had been having joint pain, worse over the past three weeks.

Patient was admitted to ICU for \nUGIB.  Following EGD patient remained hemodynamically stable, \nwas sucessfully extubated and was transferred to medical floor. \n\n# Upper GI bleeding: Patient presented with UGIB.  Received a \ntotal of 3 units pRBCs and FFP at OSH.  Bleeding resolved after \ndieulafoy clipping and variceal banding.  TIPS is an option \nshould bleeding recur. Hct has been stable since \nclipping\/banding. Patient was continued on octreotide gtt for 72 \nhours after bleeding stopped. She received protonix 40 mg IV \nBID.  She was started on ceftriaxone 1 g Q24 for 5 days after \nbleed for SBP prophylaxis.  Patient was started on carafate \nslurry and nadolol 48 hrs after cessation of bleeding.  She \nremained hemodynamically stable and was called out to medicine \nfloor where she had no recurrence of her bleed. She was \ndischarged on a PPI, nadolol and a fourteen day course of \ncarafate.   \n \n#  Encephalopathy: Etiology likely hepatic encephalopathy \ntriggered by GI bleed or Alcoholic Hepatitis although could be \nmedication effect vs UTI.  No evidence of PVT\/Budd Chiari or \nliver mass on RUQ US. Mental status improved with extubation and \nlactulose.  Patient was continued on lactulose and rifaxaimin \nwith improvement in encephalopathy. She was oriented, \nappropriate and without asterixis at discharge.  \n\n# Alcoholic Hepatitis: Patient was actively drinking leading up \nto this admission and labs show evidence of Alcoholic Hep with \nelevated AST, Tbili, INR. Following extubation, encouraged \naggressive nutrition with Dobhoff tube but patient refused so \nshe was encouraged to drink six Ensures a day in addition to her \nregular meals. Pentoxyfylline was started and her liver enzymes \ninitially continued to trend up with discriminant factors > 50. \nRepeat EGD was performed to determine whether it would be safe \nto start steroids but this showed prominent ulceration and \ngastropathy that seemed susceptible to bleeding so steroids were \nnot started. At discharge her LFTs were stabilizing so she was \ndischarged on a 28 day course of pentoxyfylline. She was \nencouraged to follow-up with her outpatient hepatologist. Social \nwork and the team expressed to her the importance of abstaining \nfrom alcohol and entering relapse prevention. \n\n# Decompensated cirrhosis with encephalopathy: MELD is 22. \nSecondary to ETOH and untreated hepatitis C. Viral load was \n88,000 and genotype was pending at discharge. Patient continued \non lactulose, rifaxamin, nadolol as above.  \n\n# ETOH abuse: Patient had withdrawal at OSH treated with IV \ndiazepam.  She was intubated on arrival as she was \nobtuned\/required airway protection prior to procedures.  Patient \nwas continued on CIWA scale, but this was discontinued in ICU as \nshe had no further withdrawal symptoms.  Patient was continued \non multivitamin, thiamine, folate.  Social work was consulted \nand patient was given information regarding relapse prevention. \n.\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES\n- Patient will require EUS to biopsy submucosal mass in the \nduodenum found on repeat EGD\n- HCV genotype was pending at discharge\n \nMedications on Admission:\nMedications home: \nNabumetone\n\nMedications on transfer:\nOcretotide drip\nPantoprazole drip\nCeftriaxone\n\n \nDischarge Medications:\n1.

We performed an EGD that isolated and treated the source of bleeding. You were transferred out to the medicine floor, where we continued treating your liver disease. Your bilirubin continued to rise and we started a medicine called pentoxyphylline to decrease the inflammation in the liver which you will need to continue taking for the next month. This inflammation was due to your recent alcohol use. A repeat endoscopy showed no active bleeding but you still have ulcers that are very susceptible to bleeding. As our team and our social worker discussed with you, you must refrain from any future alcohol intake, otherwise you will get even more sick and may even die.

You had an EKG performed of your heart that showed a pathologic rhythm of your heart that was causing your symptoms. This rhythm is known as \"Tachy Brady Syndrome\", and can cause your heart rate to become very slow and cause you to be lightheaded and possibly pass out. You had a pacemaker placed, as this can control your heart rate if it becomes too slow, and prevent you from experiencing these episodes of lightheadedness. Even though you had a pacemaker placed, this does not stop you from having your atrial fibrillation, a condition where the upper chamber of the heart \"quivers\". Because you have atrial fibrillation, you will need to continue on your blood thinners (Warfarin) to prevent blood clots from forming in the \"quivering\" chambers of the heart."}

Mild cardiomegaly is re- \ndemonstrated.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged with \ndense atherosclerotic calcification of the aortic knob noted. \nMild pulmonary vascular congestion is similar compared to the \nprior study. More focal patchy opacity in the retrocardiac \nregion could reflect an area of atelectasis though infection is \nnot completely excluded. No large pleural effusion or \npneumothorax is identified.  Marked degenerative changes of both \nacromioclavicular joints are seen. High riding right humeral \nhead suggests underlying rotator cuff disease. Remote right \neighth rib fracture is again seen. \n  \nImpression: Mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Retrocardiac \nopacity likely reflects atelectasis but infection is not \nexcluded in the correct clinical setting. \n\n***************\nCXR ___\n**************\nFINDINGS:  \n  \nPediatric sternal wires are present. A prosthetic cardiac valve \nis unchanged in configuration.  The heart size is top-normal.  \nThe aortic arch is moderately calcified.  There is no \npneumothorax or pleural effusion.  The central pulmonary vessels \nare prominent, without edema or congestion. \n  \nThere persistent left retrocardiac opacity is again seen, \nslightly more \nexaggerated on the current examination due to lower lung \nvolumes, likely reflecting atelectasis, although underlying \nconsolidation cannot be entirely excluded. \n  \nIMPRESSION:  \n  \nMinimal change since the ___ chest radiograph. \nPersistent left \nretrocardiac opacity is difficult to differentiate between \natelectasis and small consolidation. \n\n***************\nCXR ___\n***************\n\nFINDINGS:  \n  \nThe chin obscures the right apex. The heart is mildly enlarged.  \nThe hilar and mediastinal contour course are unchanged.  \nPediatric sternal wires and a cardiac valve are unchanged in \norientation. There is new pulmonary vascular congestion with \nmild edema and new small bilateral pleural effusions. \n  \nIMPRESSION:  \n  \nNew pulmonary vascular congestion and mild pulmonary edema, with \nnew small bilateral pleural effusions. \n\n***************\n___ ___\n***************\n\nFindings:  \n  \nSome of the images were repeated due to motion artifact. There \nis no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage, edema, mass \neffect, or large vascular territorial infarction. Mildly \nprominent ventricles and sulci are likely secondary to age \nrelated atrophy. Periventricular, deep, and subcortical white \nmatter hypodensities, extensive but grossly unchanged, are \nlikely sequela of chronic small vessel ischemic disease in a \npatient of this age. \n  \nRight maxillary sinus is atelectatic and completely opacified. \nThere is mild mucosal thickening within the left maxillary \nsinus. There is also mild mucosal thickening within bilateral \nanterior ethmoid air cells and frontoethmoidal recesses. Right \nfrontal sinus is hypoplastic. There is minimal mucosal \nthickening in the right sphenoid sinus anteriorly. Mastoid air \ncells are well aerated bilaterally. \n  \nImpression: \n1. No evidence for acute intracranial abnormalities.  MRI would \nbe more \nsensitive for an acute infarction, if clinically warranted. \n2. Chronic right maxillary sinusitis with atelectasis of the \nright maxillary sinus. \n\n***************\nMRI Head ___\n***************\nFINDINGS:  \n  \nAs mentioned on the preliminary read, there is a tiny focus of \nslow diffusion in the head of the right caudate series 500 and \n502, image 19, representing a small acute infarct. Another tiny \nfocus noted in the left frontal lobe anterior to the central \nsulcus series 502, image 24 is not convincingly identifiable on \nthe ADC sequence on the FLAIR sequence and is too small to be \naccurately characterized. This can represent another tiny \ninfarct versus artifact. No significant surrounding edema or \nmass effect noted around these. No abnormal enhancement. \n\nThe ventricles, the extra-axial CSF spaces, cerebral sulci and \ncerebellar \nfolia are mildly prominent related to some degree of diffuse \nparenchymal \nvolume loss. \n\nThere are extensive FLAIR hyperintense foci in the \nperiventricular and \nsubcortical white matter on the frontal and the parietal lobes \nand a few in the left temporal lobe series 7, image 10, \nnonspecific in appearance and mildly progressed since the prior \nstudy. The small foci in the left temporal lobe are new on the \nprior study of ___. No abnormal enhancement is noted in these \nfoci however. There is no obvious abnormal pachymeningeal or \nleptomeningeal enhancement. \n  \nA tiny T1 hyperintense focus on the spin echo postcontrast \nimages series 10, image 7, may relate to the adjacent bone, as \nnot identifiable on the MPRAGE sequence. The major intracranial \narterial flow voids are noted. There is fetal PCA pattern on the \nleft side. The venous sinuses are unremarkable. Sella, pineal \ngland and the craniocervical junction regions are unremarkable. \n  \nMild ethmoidal mucosal thickening. Sphenoid sinus septations \ninsert on the carotid grooves. The imaged orbits are \nunremarkable. The mastoid air cells are grossly clear. Slightly \nhypointense marrow signal of the calvarium, as before, can \nrelate to cellular marrow, myeloproliferative or \nlymphoproliferative disorders. \n  \n  \nIMPRESSION:  \n  \nTiny acute infarct in the head of the right caudate and a \nquestionable focus in the left frontal lobe anterior to the \ncentral sulcus.  No surrounding edema or mass effect or abnormal \nenhancement. Extensive nonspecific cerebral white matter \nchanges, some of which are progressed since the prior study of \n___. Small foci in the left temporal lobe, new since the prior \nstudy. No abnormal enhancement in the brain parenchyma or \nmeninges.

Penetration with thin and nectar-thick barium. \n2. Gross aspiration with nectar thick barium. \n\n=================\nEEG Recording\n=================\n___: This is an abnormal continuous ICU EEG monitoring \nstudy because of diffuse background, occasional right temporal \nand near continuous bi-posterior slowing. These findings are \nindicative of a moderate encephalopathy of nonspecific etiology, \nwith the more focal right temporal slowing concerning for focal \nsubcortical dysfunction in this region also of nonspecific \netiology and the bi-posterior slowing concerning for a possible \nstructural lesion. The multifocal and generalized discharges \nwith triphasic morphology (GPD+R) are indicative of global \ncortical irritability with a possible underlying toxic-metabolic \ncomponent. By formal criteria, no electrographic seizures are \nrecorded. \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n=================\nSUMMARY STATMENT\n=================\n___ with extensive cardiac history including atrial fibrillation \nand congestive heart failure (ejection fraction of 35-40%) \npresented with altered mental status (unresponsive), likely \nsecondary to pneumonia and ischemic right caudate stroke, with \noverlying toxic metabolic encephalopathy as measured on EEG. She \ncompleted a course of antibiotics for her pneumonia, was already \non maximal medical therapy for stroke prevention and treatment, \nand began antiepileptic treatment with Keppra. Because of her \naltered mental status and stroke, she failed speech and swallow \nand ultimately required placement of a nasogastric tube for \nnutrition. On admission she also had elevated troponins, which \nwere attributed to demand ischemia, and LFTs, both of which had \nresolved. She has improved slightly since admission--she is \nalert and interactive--though far from baseline; her recovery \nfrom the stroke is likely limited given presence of vascular \ndementia and multiple cardiac comorbidities.\n\n=================\nACTIVE ISSUES\n=================\n\n# Altered mental status:\nAt baseline she has dementia but is normally talkative and \nresponsive. She was found unresponsive ___ @ ~5:30AM after \ngoing to sleep the night before, so it was unclear when the \ninsult occurred. Initial evaluation did not show any evidence of \nbleeding (NCHCT), significant electrolyte abnormalities (only \nhad slight hyponatremia to 133, hypocalcemia to 8.3 with ionized \ncalcium 1.07, and hypomagnesemia to 0.9 which improved with \nrepletion), or digoxin toxicity (level 0.9; no bradycardia or AV \nblock on EKG and Cr at baseline). There was concern for \ninfection give patient's history of becoming slightly confused \nwith UTIs, but initially she was afebrile and without \nleukocytosis. Her UA was clear and CXR showed evidence of \npotential LLL PNA. She was started on broad spectrum \nantibiotics, which were discontinued after a negative LP on \n___. However, that evening, she spiked a fever and developed \nhypoxia (see active issue \"Pneumonia\" below) and was restarted \non antibiotics, which were later narrowed. Her full antiobiotic \ncourse is listed below. An MRI also revealed evidence of a \nstroke (see active issue \"Stroke\" below). Because patient \ncontinued to exhibit abulia and remained minimally verbal \n(though improved from admission), an EEG was obtained, which \nshowed abnormal discharges (see active issue \"Abnormal EEG\" \nbelow).   Antibiotic history:\n-Vanc 1000mg IV bid ___ \n-Zosyn 4.5g IV q8hr ___\n-Ampicillin 2g IV q6hr ___\n-Cefepime 2g IV bid ___\n-Levofloxacin 750mg IV daily ___\n\n# Ischemic Stroke:  \nShe exhibited persistent left-sided weakness, depressed mental \nstatus, aspiration, and non-specific EEG changes. MRI on ___ \nshowed a small acute infarct in the right caudate and a \nquestionable focus in the left frontal lobe. Family was informed \nthat she has a guarded prognosis given that she developed a \nstroke on optimal medical management of stroke risk factors and \nlimited recovery since presentation. Because she is already \nanticoagulated on warfarin, she does not require additional \ntreatment with aspirin.\n\n# Abnormal EEG:\nVideo EEG monitoring started on ___. She was noted to have \nbeta and delta wave slowing with non-specific discharges and \nsome focality in temporal region, consistent with possible \nmetabolic toxic abnormality. At the recommendation of neurology, \nshe was started on Keppra (500mg -> 750mg bid) and showed \nimprovement on EEG. \n\n# Community Aquired Pneumonia:\nFive day course of antibiotics completed.  Patient had RLL \ninfiltrate on admission chest x-ray, fever, and hypoxemia.  \n\n# Aspiration\nConcern for aspiration from CXR obtained for fever\/hypoxia on \n___. Patient coughed with all consistencies on ___ and \ndesatted to the ___ at one point. On ___ S\/S eval did not \ncough but still desatted. On ___ Video swallow demonstrated \npenetration with thin and thick liquids and gross aspiration \nwith nectar thick. on ___ patient had delayed cough with ice \nchips and pureed foods; still at significant risk for \naspiration.\n\n# Nutrition\nPatient has been kept NPO ___ ___. Giving maintenance fluids \nD51\/2NS with close attention to fluid status given history of \nCHF. After initial unsuccessful attempts at NGT placement, she \nreceived one on ___ and was started on tube feeds of Glucerna \n1.2 @ 55ml\/hr, which she tolerated well\n\n# Goals of Care\nFamily meetings were held throughout her hospitalization. \nUltimately, the decision was to make Ms. ___ DNR\/DNI given \nthat CPR is not indicated for her.  On the day before discharge, \na family meeting was held with ___ (HCP, daughter), ___ \n(son), ___ (husband), Dr. ___ from palliative care, \nand her primary team.  We offfered a framework for discussing \nthree realms of priorities: (a) comfort & dignity, (b) length of \ndays, (c) physical location of care.  Also discussed the options \nfor feeding and the risks \/ benefits of each:  (a) nasogastric \ntube, (b) PEG tube, (c) supervised feeding by mouth.  Patient is \nbeing transferred to an acute rehabilitation facility to \noptimize her chances of recovery from her acute stroke, and to \ncontinue a trial of tube feeds.  However, ___ \n___, is far from home and difficult for her husband, ___ to \naccess as he does not drive long distances.  Family plans to \nconvene with patient's brothers on ___ and ask her what she \nwants, and honor her wishes.  They hope to ultimately bring the \npatient closer to home.  ___ signed DNR\/DNI form which is \nplaced in paper chart and copy was given to her.  \n\n# Transaminitis:\nElevated AST\/ALT and alk pho with normal bili, suggesting \nhepatocellular pattern. Wide differential with negative work-up \nincluded: hepatitis (viral abs negative), medication effect \n(statin held initially), a\/calculous cholecystitis (would expect \nleukocytosis and higher LFTs; further RUQ U\/S on ___ \nnegative), or parasitic infection (smear negative). LFTs \ndowntrended to within normal limits and her statin was \nrestarted.  However, upon restarting atorvastatin 80mg, her LFTs \nwere beginning to trend up again.  She previously tolerated \natorvastatin at a dose of 20mg, so upon discharge, atorvastatin \nwas reduced to 40mg.  LFTs should be repeated after several days \nof the decreased dose.\n\n# Periorbital edema \/ erythema:  \nLikely due to fluid overload \/ hypoalbuminemia.  Negative \nscreening tests for inflammatory disease \/ multiple myeloma.\n\n=================\nINACTIVE ISSUES\n=================\n\n# Congestive Heart Failure:\nDiastolic dysfunction with recent LVEF 40% on ___ TTE. CXR on \n___ revealed patchy diffuse opacities so diuretics were \nrestarted. BNP at that time was ___. She was discharged on her \nhome medications.  \n\n# Troponinemia:  \nTroponins elevated at the ED and peaked ___ at 0.30 without \nelevated CK-MB (5, 6) or acute EKG changes, suggesting demand \nischemia without infarction. Underlying causes for increased \ndemand likely infection or CHF exacerbation (see above). Of \nnote, patient had similar elevation of troponins in the recent \npast. TTE performed on ___ notable for left ventricular \nsystolic function that is mildly to moderately depressed (LVEF= \n40 %) with inferior\/infero-lateral hypokinesis and septal \ndysynchrony \/ hypokinesis.\n\n# Atrial Fibrillation:\nChronic condition; CHADS2 score of 4 (CHF, HTN, Age, DM). She \nwas monitored on telemetry and appropriately anticoagulated \n(reversed temporarily for LP procedure on ___. We discussed \nwith her family on ___ that her stroke is likely secondary to \nAF and that patient is already receiving maximal treatment for \nthis.\n\n# Coronary artery disease:\nHistory of MI in ___. Cardiac medications as above.\n\n# Diabetes Mellitus Type 2:\nOn metformin at home, treated with insulin sliding scale while \ninpatient.

We performed an extensive work-up that showed evidence of a recent stroke, a likely pneumonia, and small areas of abnormal discharges on EEG brain monitoring which may put ___ at risk for seizures. ___ did not require any additional medications for your stroke because ___ already taking the appropriate ones. ___ completed a course of antibiotics for your pneumonia. Finally, ___ started an antiseizure medication called Keppra. After your stroke, when eating or drinking, food would sometimes go down the wrong pipe and into your lungs. Because of this, ___ received feedings through a tube that goes directly to your stomach. In the ED, they also found that your troponin levels were elevated. Troponin is an enzyme that indicates how much stress the heart is experiencing. Because another heart-specific laboratory test (CK-MB) was normal and because your EKG did not show any new changes, we did not think that ___ were having a heart attack. Instead, we think your heart was just stressed from the underlying infection and stroke. Additionally, in the ED, they found that your liver enzymes were elevated. We did an ultrasound of your abdomen that showed a normal liver and gallbladder. Your gallbladder did have gallstones, which are common in older individuals, but they were not blocking anything. We also checked for possible infections that could cause this, such as hepatitis, but those tests were negative. The liver enzymes decreased to their normal levels after a few days, however, and there is no evidence of any liver problems anymore. Thank ___ for choosing the ___ for your care."}

A dual-lead left-sided pacer remains in place.  The heart \nremains\nenlarged.  There are bilateral effusions, left greater than \nright, with\nassociated bibasilar airspace disease, left greater than right, \nwhich may\nreflect compressive atelectasis, although pneumonia or \naspiration should also be considered.

Prominent right lower extremity superficial soft tissue \nedema.\n3.  Right sided ___ cyst (medial popliteal fossa cyst).\n \n___ left UE US:\nIMPRESSION:  No evidence of DVT in the left arm.  No superficial \nvein\nthrombosis.\n\n___ CXR:\nIn comparison with study of ___, the hazy opacification \ninvolving \nthe right hemithorax is unchanged, consistent with moderate \nright pleural \neffusion.  However, the layering effusion on the left has \nsubstantially \ncleared, though some of this could reflect change in patient \nposition.  The pulmonary vascularity has substantially improved. \n Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette persists.  Dual-channel \npacer device remains in place. \n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ yo female with CKD, HTN, diastolic CHF, AF on coumadin, s\/p \nnephrectomy, chronic right pleural effusion with pleurex \ncatheter in place, and chronic bilateral massive edema presents \nwith leg erythema consistent with cellulitis.  Course \ncomplicated by new diagnosis of lung cancer, acute on chronic \nrenal failure, acute on chronic CHF exacerbation, anemia and \nthrombocytopenia\n  \nACTIVE ISSUES:\n# CELLULITIS:\nUnilateral erythema and warmth in right leg consistent with \ninfection.  She was initially started on broad coverage with IV \nvancomycin on ___ and was narrowed on ___ to doxycycline with \nvery good effect. She finished a 7 day course of doxycycline on \n___ \n\n# ADENOCARCINOMA OF THE LUNG: \nPleural fluid cytology was consistent with adenocarcinoma of the \nlung. Thus, the effusion was likely partially malignant in \nnature. She will likely not pursue further therapy but will \nfollow-up with oncology as an outpatient to discuss options. \n \n# PLEURAL EFFUSIONS: Multifactorial. Pleural fluid studies were \nmostly consistent with transudate but LDH elevated suggesting \nexudate. Initially attributed to acute on chronic diastolic \nheart failure but patient failed to improve with diuresis. \nDiagnosis of lung cancer was then made from the cytology thus \nsuggesting the effusion could be partially malignant in nature. \nShe was initially diuresed aggressively with IV lasix and \neffectively lost volume, but effusions did not improve much, \nlikely as they were partially malignant in origin. She already \nhad a pleural catheter in place on the right so this was drained \nmultiple times during her hospitalization for 300-500cc each \ntime. Given her persistent left effusion despite diuresis this \nwas drained by thoracentesis with a total of 1.2L removed.  She \nexperienced good relief initially, but unfortunately the \neffusion reaccumulated quickly, so IP placed a pleurex catheter \non ___ for periodic drainage at rehab and at home. Her lasix was \ninitially increased but then decreased back to her home dose at \ndischarge. New dry weight is ~62.1kg.\n\n# ANEMIA AND THROMBOCYTOPENIA:\nNoted incidentally to have a decrease in platelets from \npreviously normal values to 60-70K on admission, which appears \nto have developed in ___. She also had a slow decrease in \nher hemoglobin\/hematocrit over that time period and some \npositive markers of hemolysis, including a positive coomb's \ntest.  Given these two findings, it was thought that she may \nhave ___ (warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia and \nthrombocytopenia).  Hematology was consulted and reviewed her \nsmear, which was not consistent with hemolytic anemia, so they \nthought anemia may be due to chronic slow blood loss (esp given \ncoumadin use).  Thrombocytopenia thought to be ITP vs \ndrug-induced, so ranitidine was stopped since that is a \nmedication that can have this effect.  Platelets improved to \n>100K on discharge. She will follow up with hematology on ___ \nand should have her CBC monitored at her next PCP ___.\n \n# ACUTE ON CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE:\nCr up to 1.8 from baseline ~1.4 on admission.  Likely due to \ncardiorenal syndrome and venous congestion, as creatinine \nactually improved back to baseline with diuresis.\n  \nINACTIVE ISSUES BY PROBLEM:\n# ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: Coumadin held intermittently during \nhospitalization for planned procedures such as the thoracentesis \nand pleurex placement, but it was restarted on discharge.  She \nshould have her next INR on ___ at rehab. \n \n# CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE:\nPlavix held prior to pleurex placement. Since patient's last \nstent was in ___ and is on coumadin, plavix was dc'ed on \ndischarge. Continued on statin and metoprolol.  Not on aspirin \ndue to allergy.\n \n# HYPOTHYROIDISM:\nContinued on home dose of levothyroxine\n \nTRANSITIONS OF CARE:\n- CHF:  dc'd on lasix 40mg daily (home dose), needs daily \nweights (dry weight 62.1kg)\n- Pleural effusions: pleurex catheters now bilateral (left \nplaced ___, should be drained 3x\/weekly at least or as symptoms \narise\n- Anemia and thombocytopenia: should have CBC at next PCP appt \nafter discharge from rehab.

Atrial flutter. No previous tracing available \nfor\ncomparison.\n  IntervalsAxes\n___\n___\n\nECHO  ___\nConclusions\nThe left atrial volume index is severely increased. Due to \nsuboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality \ncannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic \nfunction is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size \nand free wall motion are normal. The number of aortic valve \nleaflets cannot be determined. The aortic valve leaflets are \nmoderately thickened. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly \nthickened. There is no pericardial effusion. \n\nIMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Nomal biventricular \nregional\/global systolic function. A wall motion abnormality \ncannot be fully excluded due to limited image quality. Apex \nmoves well so apical thrombus very unlikely in setting of normal \nejection fraction. The patient appears to be in atrial flutter, \nhas biatrial enlargment with left atrium severely enlarged, \nthere is mitral annular calcification. All these findings \nincrease the risk of stroke due to atrial fib\/flutter. There is \nno direct echocardiographic evidence of a cardiac thrombus. \n\nPORTABLE CXR  ___\nFINDINGS: \nSupine portable AP view of the chest. Underlying trauma board is \nin place. \nCalcified pleural plaques are better visualize on the same day \nchest CT. There\nis no consolidation, or supine evidence for effusion or \npneumothorax. Heart\nsize is within normal limits. Mediastinal contour is normal. No \ndisplaced\nfractures are seen.\nIMPRESSION: \nNo acute findings.\n\nRIGHT KNEE X rays:\nFINDINGS: \nAP, oblique, cross-table lateral views of the right knee were \nprovided. There\nis no fracture or dislocation. No joint effusion is seen. There \nis minimal\nosteoarthritis with tiny marginal spurs. Vascular calcifications \nare present.\nIMPRESSION: \nNo fracture or dislocation.\n\nC SPINE FLEXION\/EXTENSION\nThere are severe degenerative changes of cervical spine with \nloss of\nintervertebral disc height at virtually most levels.  At C7-T1, \nthere is\nanterolisthesis measuring 5 mm.  This is better appreciated on \nthe subsequent\nMRI of the cervical spine.  There are no compression \ndeformities.  The\nprevertebral soft tissues are within normal limits.\n\nMR THORACIC, CERVICAL SPINE\nIMPRESSION:\n1. Multilevel degenerative spondylosis, greatest within the \ncervical spine\nthere is moderate spinal canal narrowing and severe neural \nforaminal stenoses,\nas described.\n2. No evidence of ligamentous injury. Spondylolisthesis of C7 on \nT1 is likely\non a degenerative basis.\nProbable renal cysts are noted.\n\nMRA NECK\/BRAIN\/HEAD\nIMPRESSION:\n1. No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, or \nacute\nischemia.\n2. Brain parenchymal volume loss and presumed sequelae of \nchronic small vessel\nischemic disease.\n3. No evidence of hemodynamically significant stenosis, \npathologic large\nvessel occlusion, or aneurysm within the vasculature of the head \nor neck.\n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ with history of afib\/aflutter on coumadin, CKD who\npresented on ___ as a unrestrained driver involved MVA found to \nhave liver laceration, C7-T1 subluxation, subacute R occipital \nstroke, L5compression fracture, R ear hematoma and scalp \nlaceration. Now s\/p TSICU stay with stable H\/H. Current course \nin complicated by hyponatremia of unknown etiology.\n\nACTIVE ISSUES:\n\n#TSICU COURSE: \nMr. ___ was met in the emergency department at ___ by the \ntrauma surgery service after his motor vehicle crash on ___ \nand transfer from ___. He underwent extensive \nimaging and was ultimately brought to the intensive care unit \nfor monitoring. Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Spine were \nconsulted. His coumadin was held and his hematocrit checked \nevery 4 hours. His hyponatremia was gently corrected. Overnight, \nthe patient was hemodynamically stable and his hematocrit was \nalso stable. The following morning, the patient's cervical \ncollar was cleared. He was given a regular diet. He got out of \nbed to a chair. The patient was transferred to the floor under \nthe care of the medicine service. \n\n#Hyponatremia: On exam, euvolemic. Urine electrolytes with \nUOsms=480, UNa 95, all c\/w SIADH. He has a history of SIADH as \nan outpatient previously.  The etiology of this is unclear.  On \n___ his Na was 129. He has had a progressive ___ from \n___ with Na dropping 139->137->131->129. Could be 2'\/2 old \ninfarct, head trauma from the accident, or ?malignancy in his \nkidney or pancreas. Post trauma pain could have also \ncontributed. He was fluid restricted 2L\/d with rise to 133-136.\n\n#R Occipital Stroke: per MRI and MRA imaging this is NOT acute \nand not likely to be 2'\/2 trauma. It is possible that this \nstroke may have caused visual loss leading to his accident. A \nTTE was negative for cardiac source of emboli. \n\n#Delirium:  Initially had episodes of delirium, believing he was \nin a grocery store, etc.  This improved after his gabapentin and \noxycodone were held. He had a UA and chest imaging on admission. \n Remained afebrile. Given continuing delirium, US resent on \n___, with negative nitrites, trace leuks (7 WBC an no bacteria \non micro), cx pending on discharge.\n\nCHRONIC ISSUES:\n\n#AFib: rate controlled with home diltiazem.  His coumadin was \ninitially held due to concern for bleeding after trauma, but \nrestarted on ___ after discussion with his PCP.  He was bridged \nwith enoxaparin to warfarin and will follow up with her PCP and \ncardiologist regarding anticoagulation as an outpatient.\n\n#CKD STage III: Baseline Cr ~1.6. Currently around baseline\n\n====================================\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\n====================================\n# please recheck chem panel ___. If Cr 1.6 or greater, please \ndiscontinue Lovenox. If Na<130, increase fluid restriction to \n1.5L per day.\n\n# please recheck INR ___ and titrate warfarin dosing as needed\n\n#SIADH: noted in ___ clinic, chronic and unlikely related to \nMVA trauma. Continued evaluation and work up in outpatient \nclinic is appropriate.  Recommend checking Chem panel within 4 \ndays of discharge and decrease fluid allowance as needed \n(currently 2L fluid restriction, could consider 1.5L if sodium \ntrends down).\n\n#HTN: Initially held Lisinopril 5mh and HCTZ 12.5mg due to \nnormal BP and liver lac, but with high blood pressures HCTZ was \nrestarted in addition to ongoing diltiazem for rate control.  \nHis blood pressures were low-normal.  Upon further discussion, \nlisinopril would be the preferred agent given her CKD, so on \ndischarge plan is to hold HCTZ and start lisinopril ___.  \nGiving all anti-hypertensive medications in AM led to morning \nborderline-low pressures.  Please administer diltiazem in AM and \nlisinopril in the evening.  Can add back HCTZ as required.\n\n#Stroke: will need formal visual field testing by ophthalmology \nas an outpatient. Consider followup with vascular neurology as \noutpatient.\n\n#Incidental findings: 2.5cm cyst in left kidney should be \nfurther assessed by ultrasound or MRI nonurgently.  And CT \nabdomen showed bilobed cystic lesion in the pancreas with mild \ndilatation of the pancreatic duct suspicious for IPMN.  \nRadiology recommended non-urgent MRCP to further assess.\n \n#A flutter\/A fib: continue warfarin (goal INR ___. will bridge \nwith Lovenox given CHADS score of 4, however if Cr increases \nplan to allow INR to drift up without ongoing lovenox bridge.  \nOn diltiazem for rate control.\n\n#Delirium: Continues to be intermittently delirious, however is \nshowing improvement (decreasing frequency of delirium).  Likely \nrelated to acute illness (MCV), subacute stroke, and hospital \nenvironment.  UA sent due to foley placement during stay, and \nwas pending at discharge-- results were trace blood, negative \nnitrites, 100 protein, neg glucose, trace ketones, negative \nbilirub, 2 urobili, pH 5.5, trace leuks, 3 RBC, 7 WBC, no \nbacteria\/yeast, 9 Hycasts.\n\n \nMedications on Admission:\n1.

To make sure this doesn't happen again after you leave the hospital, you should limit your fluid intake to 2 liters per day. For a couple days, you showed signs of confusion, disorientation, and poor attention (what we call delerium). This could have been due to medications you were on, your head injury in the accident, or your low salt. We stopped your gabapentin, as this is a medication that can worsen your mental status. During the work up of your injuries, you were found to have an old stroke which may affect your vision; because of this you should have your visual fields evaluated by an eye doctor.

As above, she presented with generalized \nmalaise, nausea, and vomiting 8 days after her most recent \nchemotherapy infusion. Clinic lab results identified a \nhypokalemia and hyponatremia. She noted she had recently been \ntaking care of her god son, who she later realized was suffering \nfrom an upper respiratory infection. Her hospital course by \nproblem is identified as follows:\n\n# Hypokalemia - Upon evaluation in clinic, Ms. ___ potassium \nlevel was determined to be low, with a value of 2.9. While still \nin clinic, she was repleted with 40 mEq potassium intravenously \nplus an additional 40 mEq PO. Upon arrival to the oncology \nfloor, her potassium was rechecked and found to still be \nhypokalemic. She was given 40 mEq orally, and then placed on a \nsliding scale repletion schedule. Prior to discharge her \npotassium rose to 3.6. Etiology of her hypokalemia was surmised \nto be seconday to her recent nausea and vomiting, likely \nchemotherapy induced. She was sent home with oral potassium \nmedication for several days until her next lab draw could be \ncompleted.\n\n# Hyponatremia - Ms. ___ was hyponatremic to 128 in clinic. \nExamination and labarotory inquiry determined this was a \neuvolemic hyponatremic hyponatremia, potentially secondary to \nSIADH caused by her underlying non-small cell adenocarcinoma. \nShe was free water restricted to 1.5L\/day, after which her serum \nsodium levels rose appropriately to 132 prior to discharge. \nAdditionally, her hypertension had been managed prior to \nadmission using chlorthalidone (in addition to atenolol). Her \nchlorthalidone was held, assuming this may play a small role in \nher hyponatremia. Her blood pressure was managed as discussed \nbelow.\n\n# Nausea\/vomiting - Despite endorsing nausea on arrival to \nclinic, Ms. ___ did not experience any nausea or vomiting \nwhile hospitalized. Ondansetron was available if needed, though \nshe did not receive any doses. Additionally, she was maintained \non her outpatient ranitidine, which she stated had quieted her \nabdominal discomfort and nausea during previous recoveries \nfollowing chemotherapy.\n\n# Leukopenia\/neutropenia - Ms. ___ was leukopenic on arrival, \nand became neutropenic on hospitalization day 2. She did not \nexhibit fever during her stay, and antibiotics were not \ninitiated. She was instructed to take careful consideration into \navoiding infection upon discharge.\n\n# HTN - Ms. ___ cancer therapy course has been complicated \nby hypertension, managed prior to admission with chlorthalidone \nand atenolol. Chlorthalidone was stopped on admission due to her \nongoing hyponatremia. Atenolol was also held, given normal vital \nsigns on arrival as well as the desire to switch to a medication \nwith a wider therapeutic window. She was started on amlodipine 5 \nmg PO daily and had blood pressures within normal limits \nthroughout her hospitalization.\n\n# Cough\/malaise - Ms. ___ generalized malaise was attributed \nto her recent chemotherapy cycle. She stated she felt this way \npreviously after chemotherapy, but this was slightly more \nsevere. Her recent exposure to her god son's upper respiratory \ninfection (likely viral) may have also contributed. She received \na chest x-ray on admission to rule-out a pneumonia, which showed \nsigns of stable neoplastic disease but was otherwise normal.\n\n=================================\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\nMs. ___ remained full code throughout the course of her \nhospitalization.\nShe will require labs a few days after discharge to follow-up on \nher electrolyte values.\n \nMedications on Admission:\nPreadmissions medications listed are incomplete and require \nfuther investigation.

The Ramus \nstent was totally occluded once again.\n\nInterventional Details\nA 6 ___ XBLAD3.5 guiding catheter was used to engage the LMCA \nand provided sub-optimal support. A 180 cm ___ Pro12 \nguidewire was then successfully delivered across the lesion. \nThis required a 6 ___ Guideliner and a Turnpike LP for \nsupport to cross as Pilot ___ and Samurai wires would not cross. \nThe CP 12 appeared and felt free after the mid vessel but was \nfree thereafter.\nCollateral flow could not confirm intraluminal position.

Prolonged inflations maintained flow. \nFinal angiography revealed normal flow, stable Type A dissection \nin the mid vessel and 40% residual stenosis. In light of CKD and \nstable angioplasty result and the lack of desire to add more \nstents to this vessel that has developed recurrent CTO, we \nelected to leave a POBA result.\nImpressions:\n1.

His Isosorbide was ultimately \nincreased from 60 mg Daily to 90 mg daily.  He was maintained on \na heparin drip while he awaiting cardiac catheterization.  For \nmore details concerning the catheterization please refer to that \nreport, detailed previously.  He underwent POBA to 100% occluded \nRAMUS stent with TIMI flow 2.  He reported relief of his \nsymptoms and continued to ambulate the unit with no further \nchest pain.  His troponins remained flat throughout his stay.  \nHis Torsemide and Spirinolactone were held post catheterization \ndue to an increase in his creatinine to 1.9.  He trended down to \n1.8 on the day of discharge.  He was advised to continue to hold \nthese meds for an additional day and to resume them on ___, \n___.  \nHis INR was therapeutic on the day of discharge at 3.1, up from \n2.1 on ___.

A \nphysical exam was performed. The patient was administered \nmoderate sedation. A physical exam was performed prior to \nadministering anesthesia. Supplemental oxygen was used. The \npatient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position and an \nendoscope was introduced through the mouth and advanced under \ndirect visualization until the jejunum (110 cm) was reached. \nCareful visualization of the upper GI tract was performed. The \nprocedure was not difficult. The patient tolerated the procedure \nwell. There were no complications.\nImpression: An actively bleeding dieulafoy was located at 110 cm \nin the jejunum. Ink tattoos were placed both distally and \nproximally to the bleeding site. A Cook metallic clip was placed \nand hemostasis was observed.

She was given a capsule endoscopy on the first day of her \nadmission, which eventually showed active bleeding int he small \nintestines on the same day that her Hct dropped from 29 to 23.  \nShe underwent a push enteroscopy by gastroenterology, which \nshowed an active dieulafoy bleed in her jejunum that was then \ncauterized.  Her Hct remained stable in low ___ throughout the \nremainder of her hospitalization, which was extended by several \ndays given the need to bridge her on heparin gtt to therapeutic \nINR levels of 2.5-3.5 given her mechanical valves.  She was \ncontinued on pantoprazole PO bid for GI prophylaxis.\n\n# Fever: Found to have a fever 101.6 and worsening \nwheezing\/cough the day after her push enteroscopy.  Initially \nconcerned for HCAP, though CXR negative ___ and ___ and no \nleukocytosis. Fever may have been related to transient \nbacteremia from procedure, or from transfusions.  Blood, urine, \nand sputum cultures were all negative.  The patient's \nwheezing\/cough improved to baseline within 2 days, and she never \nneeded antibiotic therapy (but did use nebulizer treatments).  \nThis was likely due to a short course of viral bronchitis.  \n\n#) Mechanical valves - She was considered to be at risk for \nhemolysis or for SBE in appropriate clinical setting, but did \nnot appear to have either during her hospitalization.  She was \nbridged with heparin gtt to goal INR 2.5-3.5, and on the day her \nINR was 2.7, she was discharged on her home dose of coumadin 3mg \n6x\/week and 1.5mg 1x\/week.\n\n#) Afib - remained rate-controlled throughout her \nhospitalization.  She was maintained on her home amiodarone and \nwas discharged on her home coumadin, though the latter was \ninitially held in the setting of her GI bleed.\n\n#) HTN - remained normotensive here, and though her amlodipine \nand lopressor were continued throughout her hospitalization, her \nlisinopril and triamterene\/HCTZ were initially held.

The left sided collection is mostly hypodense and \nchronic appearing though a small amount of hyperdensity is noted \nalong the posterior and inferior aspect, suggesting an acute \ncomponent. This collection measures up to 2.1 cm in thickness. \nThere is diffuse left sulcal effacement and subfalcine \nherniation with 10- mm righward shift of midline structures \n(2:16). A chronic appearing right-sided subdural collection is \nalso noted measuring approximately 11 mm in maximal thickness. A \nfew areas of linear high attenuation are noted within this \ncollection which may represent subdural membranes or a small \ncomponent of acute bleeding. Associated mass effect is noted \nwith diffuse right sulcal effacement. Slightly hyperdense \nappearance of the tentorium may be due to calcification, less \nlikely trace layering SDH. There is no evidence of \ntranstentorial herniation with patent basilar cisterns. \n.  \nThe gray- white matter differentiation is preserved, and there \nis no \nhydrocephalus. Calcification of the cavernous portions of the \ncarotid arteries and the vertebral arteries bilaterally is \nnoted. The visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells \nappear well aerated aside from a small amount of mucosal \nthickening within the left maxillary sinus. The soft tissues and \nosseous structures are intact. \n.  \nIMPRESSION: Bilateral chronic subdural hematomas, left greater \nthan right, \nwith small acute component (more evident on the left). \nAssociated mass effect with rightward shift of midline \nstructures and diffuse sulcal effacement.\n.\n.\nCT ABDOMEN\/PELVIS WITH CONTRAST ___:\nABDOMEN: There is bibasilar, dependent atelectasis. There is a \nsmall hiatal hernia. The liver, gallbladder, spleen, adrenal \nglands, and right kidney are unremarkable. A 2-cm \nlow-attenuation lesion at the upper pole of the left kidney is \ncompatible with a simple cyst. A smaller 3-mm low-attenuation \nlesion at the lower pole of the left kidney is too small to \ncharacterize but most likely represents a simple cyst (2:35). A \nprominent calcification along the left renal artery is noted. \nThere is diffuse atherosclerotic disease of the abdominal aorta. \nNote is made of a right lower quadrant ileostomy. There is no \nevidence of obstruction, free air or fluid within the abdomen. \nThere are scattered mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymph nodes, \nnone of which meet criteria for pathology by CT. A large volume \nof stool is noted within the cecum. \n.  \nCT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: A large volume of stool is \nnoted within \nthe rectum. The prostate, bladder, distal ureters, and sigmoid \ncolon are \nunremarkable. There is no free fluid within the pelvis. No \npathologically \nenlarged inguinal or pelvic lymph nodes. \n.  \nOSSEOUS STRUCTURES: There is fusion of the L1 through L3 \nvertebral bodies and the L4 through L5 vertebral bodies. There \nis associated degenerative change including vacuum disc \nphenomena at the L3-4 and L5-S1 levels. Endplate sclerosis is \nalso evident at the T12-L1 and L3-L4 levels. There is no \nassociated spondylolisthesis. \n.  \nIMPRESSION: \n1. Right lower quadrant diverting ileostomy without evidence of \nobstruction. No acute intra-abdominal or pelvic findings. \n2. Small hiatal hernia. \n.\n.\nDISCHARGE LABS:\n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ M with PMH of A-fib on coumadin, and ileostomy for unknown \nreason who presented from home with report of black stool from \nostomy, HA for several weeks and nausea. Found to have bilateral \nsubdural hematomas and guaiac positive stool, hct stable at \nbaseline of low-mid 30's. INR therapeutic on admission at 2.3. \nInitially admitted to MICU for close neurological monitoring \nwith neurosurgery and GI consults. Was transfered to the floor \nwhere he had a colonoscopy and EGD that were normal, showing no \nevidence of bleeding.  Patient was discharged home in stable \ncondition.  He is scheduled for follow up CT on ___.  \nNeurosurgery will contact patient regarding time of appointment \nthat day.\n.  \n# GIB\/anemia: \nAdmitted to ICU with report of melanotic stool from ostomy.  \nPatient also on coumadin for A-fib, was therapeutic on admission \nat 2.3   INR was reversed on admission and coumadin held. Hct \nwas stable throughout hospitalization.  Per patient, has ostomy \nfor 'redundant colon' though explanation was non-descript.  No \nhx of GIB or upper GI pathology or GERD to explain GIB.  CT abd \nshowed no mass or other pathology.  Patient underwent \ncolonoscopy and EGD on ___ which showed no abnormalities.  \nCoumadin was stopped given GIB and subdurals.  Hct stable at 32 \nupon discharge.\n.  \n# Subdural hematomas: \nFound on CT scan, appear chronic in nature on imaging. Coumadin \nreversed on admission and held as above. Patient intially \nmonitored in ICU for frequent neuro checks.  He had no change in \nmental status and his neuro exam remained non-focal throughout \nhis hospitalization.  Unclear duration of bleed, no hxistory of \ntrauma and INR not supratherapeutic, appear chronic on CT with \nsmoothing of brain surface. Hematomas also appear heterogenous \nin texture suggesting a more chronic bleed rather than acute. \nSeven mm midline shift. Patient likely not signifcantly affected \nby hematoma given age and probably lower brain volume, larger \nintracrainial space and chronicity of bleed.  Per neurosurgery, \nno intervention necessary as neuro status is unchanged from \nbaseline and is stable. Will follow up with Dr. ___ on \n___ as out patient with CT scan.

He has had an increase \nin his flares recently and this has caused him to go to multiple \nhospitals for this.  As evidence by the records obtained from \nhis outside GI physician, ___ has had several \nstents placed with varying degrees of success.  He has also had \nimaging done outside that has not shown findings consistent with \nchronic pancreatitis.  As a result, the differential diagnosis \nof his abdominal pain was broadened to include cecal volvulus, \nconstipation related, acute intermittent porphyria, autoimmune \nvasculitis or SLE\/RA related, hernia related, PUD or IBS\/IBD.  \nGI was consulted in house and advised checking a TTG for celiac \ndisease (negative) ESR\/CRP (CRP was elevated) and IGG4 for \nautoimmune pancreatitis (negative).  Due to persistent abdominal \npain, the patient got a plane film abdominal XR which showed \nfindings suggestive of cecal volvulus.  A CT of the abdomen and \npelvis was obtained which was negative for an acute process.  \nThese films were reviewed with the radiologist to evaluate a \nnarrowed and dilated segment near the patients prior colostomy \nbut they felt this was just several slices missed in the CT \nscanner.

His diet was slowly advance, which he \ntolerated well.  He was discharged home on a bland diet and a \nPPI BID.  He should follow closely with a pancreas specialist \nfor further evaluation.\n.\n# History of alcoholism with persistent pain without an obvious \norganic cause:\nThe patient reports not using alcohol since ___.  The patients \nfamily voiced some concerns about narcotic\/opioid dependence.  \nIn addition, after extensive evaluation and conservative \nmanagement, the patient was still requiring high dose of IV \nmorphine (in the 200-300 mg IV range in 24 hours) from his PCA \nwithout any obvious cause.  The pain service was consulted and \nthey advised using gabapentin, Tylenol and discontinuing the pca \nand using both long and short acting morphine.  The day \nfollowing removal of the PCA, the patient had a minimal narcotic \nrequirement.  Thus, he was sent home with just short acting \nmorphine for breakthrough pain in addition to a lower dose of \ngabapentin to prevent sedation.  He was also sent home with \nNSAID's, tramadol and a bowel regimen.\n.\n# Urinary retention\nThe patient has had issues with this in the past without any \nobvious cause.  His retention was exacerbated with his high \nnarcotic use.  A Foley needed to be placed.  The patient was \nweaned off his narcotics and his Foley was then taken out.  He \nwas able to urinate on his own\n.\n# Schistocytes on automated smear and persistent abdominal pain \nwith weight loss\nThe hematology\/oncology service was consulted for further \nevaluation of an occult malignancy vs. a hematologic process \nthat was causing the patients symptoms.  The patients smear was \nreviewed by the hematology team and it was negative for \nschistocytes.  They recommended checking urine PBG (was \nnegative) and a testicular US for occult malignancy (negative).  \nCan consider checking 24 hr urine test for ALA, PBG, and total \nporphyrins as an outpatient.  LDH was also normal and the \npatients smears did not show any signs of MDS or \nmyeloproliferative disorder.     \n.\n# Dysthymia\nThe patient endorsed depressed mood without SI or HI.  \nPsychiatry was consulted per pain recommendations and they \nrecommended d\/c of the patients hydroxyzine and starting Remeron \nat night.

Nasal bone fractures are probably chronic, be correlated \nclinically. \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ with unclear past medical history (possible previous \nsubstance abuse\/psych admissions for agitation), who was \nadmitted on ___ after being found unresponsive after \nunknown substance ingestion. Soon after arrival to the hospital \nhe became acutely agitated and violent, requiring physical and \nchemical restraints. The ingested substance(s) were never \ndefinitely established, but the toxidrome and history pointed \ntoward a synthetic cannabinoid ingestion (patient's girlfriend \nat one point admitted that patient had recent \"K-2\" use). Tox \nscreen was positive for benzodiazepines and oxycodone. PCP \nscreen was sent and was pending at discharge. Collateral from \npatient's\ngirlfriend revealed that he told her that he had used K2 and\nheroin, which he admitted to psychiatry moonlighter on ___. \nHe later told that psychiatry ___ on ___ that he had \nused Xanax and gabapentin. \n\nHis agitation in the ED manifested as violent thrashing and \nuncooperative behavior requiring multiple security personnel to \nrestrain him for the safe administration of medications. He \nrequired large doses of benzodiazepines, neuroleptics, and \nketamine and was eventually intubated for airway protection.\n\nWhile intubated, he required large doses of propofol, fentanyl, \nand precedex with intermittent breakthrough midazolam to \nmaintain safe and adequate sedation.\n\nOn ___, he was extubated however developed severe agitation \nwith required 4-point leather restraints and escalating doses \nHaldol, thorazine, and lorazepam. Ultimately, the patient's \nagitation became so violent that he required re-initiation of \npropofol and fentanyl with re-intubation. Psychiatry was \nemergently consulted and recommended control of agitation with \nliberal use of benzodiazepines given high suspicion for \nsynthetic cannabinoid ingestion.\n\nBy ___, patient was able to be extubated again. Agitation was \ncontrolled with benzodiazepines and intermittent physical \nrestraints. Agitation slowly waned and patient became more \ncooperative. His family and loved ones agreed that he was \nreturning to his baseline mental status.\n\nHospital course was complicated by rhabdomyolysis with CK \npeaking >6000, likely secondary to violent thrashing against \nrestraints. he was treated with IV fluids with sustained \ndowntrending CK. Patient also has some skin\/soft tissue injuries \nfrom fighting against restraints. These were dressed and cared \nfor by nursing without signs of infection or local \ncomplications.\n\n=====================\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\n=====================\n[ ] Patient needs to establish primary care with a local PCP. \nFollow up with a psychiatric or mental health specialist is also \nstrongly encouraged.\n[ ] Patient is strongly encouraged to abstain from any further \nsubstance use, especially with illicit drugs such as synthetic \ncannabinoids, non-prescribed benzodiazepines, and non-prescribed \nopioids. \n\n#COMMUNICATION: Girlfriend ___ ___\n#CODE: Full (presumed)\n\n \nMedications on Admission:\nNone\n \nDischarge Medications:\nNone\n \nDischarge Disposition:\nHome\n \nDischarge Diagnosis:\nPrimary Diagnosis: Toxic Ingestion, unspecified, suspected \nsynthetic cannabinoid toxicity.\n\n \nDischarge Condition:\nMental Status: Clear and coherent.\nLevel of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.\nActivity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.","summary":"You were admitted to ___. You were found unresponsive and then became extremely agitated and demonstrated dangerous behavior. In addition, you had injury to your muscles (rhabdomyolysis) causing a high level of CK in the blood, which can cause kidney damage. All of these problems were probably the result of drug use, likely from synthetic cannabinoids (for example, K-2). To control your agitation and to keep you safe, you required large doses of powerful medications to calm you. At times your behavior was so dangerous that you had to be heavily sedated and put on a breathing machine. To protect your kidneys from the muscle breakdown, you received intravenous fluids. Finally, you were evaluated and followed by the psychiatry department as well as the hospital social worker. You need to stay hydrated by drinking lots of water and lead a healthy lifestyle. You should avoid all drugs including K-2 and other synthetic cannabinoids, heroin\/oxycodone\/opiates, Xanax\/other benzodiazepines, marijuana, and alcohol. You are encouraged to get treatment for dangerous substance use through a drug counseling program."}

Attention on followup is \nrecommended. \n\nUS ABD LIMIT, SINGLE ORGAN ___   \nSmall to moderate amount of ascites, predominantly located in \nthe upper \nquadrants. This is unchanged compared to recent CT. Given the \nbleeding risk due to abnormal coagulation parameters and the \namount of fluid present, a therapeutic paracentesis is unlikely \nto relieve the patient's symptoms. \n\nMicro:\n------\nUrine culture, blood culture, and peritoneal cultures negative \nto date. Hep C Viral Load negative. \n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ with PMH HCV, ETOH cirrhosis with ascites, hx of DVT, \nlymphedema, COPD, hx of MRSA bacteremia s\/p 4 week course of \ndaptomycin (completed ___ transfer from ___ after \npresenting with 2 weeks of worsening abdominal distention and \npain as well as worsening jaundice found to have decompensated \ncirrhosis, ___, and a new liver lesion very concerning for ___, \ndischarged to hospice.\n\nACUTE ISSUES:\n# Decompensated Etoh cirrhosis with liver infarction complicated \nby ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, and liver infarction: \nPatient presented from OSH with increasing abdominal distension \nand pain in the setting of a new 11 cm area of hypointensity on \nAbdominal CT with a 3x4 cm lymph node. Pt also had ___ and \n___ bilirubin (see below for more on ___. Multiple cultures \n(blood, urine, peritoneum) were negative for infectious work up. \nThough pt was reported to have a h\/o HCV, his HCV VL and Ab were \nalso negative. Lesion was not seen on CT in ___. AFP was \nalso elevated at 27.1, up from 1.9 on ___, which made lesions \nhighly concerning for ___ in the setting of his cirrhosis. \nPatient did not tolerate MRI with contrast. Tri phase abd CT \nread and discussed at ___ Board Meeting as large infarct but \nof unclear etiology.  Liver infarction was thought to be the \netiology of his liver decompensation as other work up was \nnegative. Bilirubin continued to rise throughout admission. \nRenal function initially improved with fluids, but then worsened \nagain and was not fluid responsive. On the day of discharge pt \nhad become more somnolent and encephalopathic. Given poor \nbaseline liver function now c\/b large infarct and worsening \nrenal disease, it was thought that pt had extremely poor \nprognosis, likely days to weeks, and liver process was not \nreversible. Decision with family was made to pursue hospice and \nhe was transferred to hospice facility. Palliative care was \ninvolved throughout the admission and made recommendations for \npain control. Patient was not a candidate for liver transplant \nbecause of concern for HCC and because of poor overall state of \nhealth. \n\n# Renal Failure: Creatinine rapidly rose on admission to \nhospital (up to 2.6 from 0.8 in ___, initially concerning \nfor HRS. However, it was fluid responsive and improved to 1.5 \nwith albumin initially. His urine sediment was unremarkable \nexcept few calcium phosphate crystals. However, as his liver \ndisease progressed over the course of his hospitalization, his \nkidneys began to fail again, and were no longer responsive to \nalbumin. His potassium on discharge was 5.2 with one minute of \nasymptomatic ventricular tachycardia. We held his home \nlasix\/aldactone throughout.\n\n# Hepatic Encephalopathy. On admission, patient presented was \nsomnolent and had mild asterixis, but no hepatic encephalopathy. \nPatient started on lactulose and rifaximin. Patient's mental \nstatus and somnolence remained the same for the rest of his \nhospitalization. However,on day of discharge, patient became \nacutely encephalopathic and confused, was A&Ox2, with moderate \nasterixis, and was increasingly somnolent. \n\nCHRONIC ISSUES:\n# Pancytopenia with low fibrinogen: Similar to baseline. \nEtiology thought to be multifactorial, including slow GI bleed, \nESLD, chronic infections, and chronic alcohol abuse. Received 1u \nPRBC and several units of cryo. We held heparin SC because of \nthrombocytopenia (plt <50). \n\n# Seizure history: Patient had no seizure-like activity \nthroughout hospitalization. Continued on home Keppra 1000 QAM \nand 1500 QHS.\n\n# COPD: Reported history. Had subjective SOB but had O2 sat >93% \non RA throughout entire hospitalization. Small pleural effusion \nnoted over R hemidiaphragm was not large enough for therapeutic \nthoracentesis. Patient was ultimately discharged on 1L NC with \noxygen saturations > 90%. Was not on any meds.\n\n# Depression\/Anxiety: Patient continued on home fluoxetine. No \nevidence of Major Depression throughout hospitalization.  \n\n# History of DVT: Patient was on pneumatic boots. No events \nthroughout hospitalization. Did not use heparin (see above).\n\n# Back pain: ___ to trauma in ___. Patient continued on home \ngabapentin.\n- continue gabapentin\n\n# Lymphedema with severe chronic venous stasis changes: Wound \ncare as needed throughout hospitalization. No antibiotics (other \nthan cipro for SBP prophylaxis) were started. \n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\n- plan is to transition to hospice\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

She was admitted to the hospital \nfor intravenous antibiotics (vancomycin) for purulent \ncellulitis. She was transitioned to oral clindamycin and \ncompleted a 7 day course on ___. She was also found to have \nright ventricular hypokinesis and a primarily restrictive \npattern on pulmonary function testing. She will follow up with \npulmonary and cardiology to continue her work up and treatment.\n\n# Right lower extremity cellulitis: Pt presented with RLE pain, \nerythema, edema, and skin break down.  The pt endorsed a \ntraumatic incident to the RLE without active bleeding but with \ndisruption of the skin barrier.  This represented the likely \nportal of entry for bacteria.  The pt was initially treated with \nKeflex as an outpatient, but her cellulitis persisted.  While \nnot much purulence was present on admission to the hospital, the \npt showed a picture on her phone with copious pus emanating from \nher RLE.  She was admitted to the hospital for IV vancomycin for \npurulent RLE cellulitis that failed outpatient management.  Day \n1 of vancomycin was ___.  On ___, she was transitioned \nto oral clindamycin.  She completed a 7 day clindamycin course \non ___.\n\n# Oxygen Requirement: Pt has desaturations to ___ with \nambulation while in the hospital.  She had a chest xray with \nevidence of mild CHF.  She had a TTE showing right ventricular \nhypokinesis.  She had a DDimer of 1008 and an inconclusive CTA.  \nGiven low concern for PE and body habitus, she did not have a VQ \nscan.  She also had PFTs showing a restrictive pattern, possible \nobstruction, and mild diffusion defect.  She was evaluated by \ncardiology and pulmonology.  The etiology of her O2 requirement \nwas felt to be multifactorial including heart failure, pulmonary \nhypertension, and OHS.  She will have further workup and \npossibly a stress test and right heart catheterization as an out \npatient.  She will also continue to use her CPAP as she can and \nwill use supplemental oxygen. She was encouraged to follow up \nwith bariatric surgery given concern that a large component of \nher disease is due to obesity.\n\n# Heart Failure: During the hospital course, the pt had chest \nxrays showing evidence of pulmonary congestion and had ___ edema. \n Her weight was over 220 kg and her most recently documented dry \nweight was 213 kg.  She was 220 kg on discharge.  She had IV \nfurosemide in the hospital with good urine output.  Her IV \ndiuresis was stopped when her creatinine increased to 1.4.  She \nwas discharged on 20 mg PO furosemide daily.  Her chlorthalidone \nwas held while she was undergoing diuresis.  She will need outpt \nmonitoring of wt and volume status as well as titration of \nfurosemide.\n\n# Obesity: Pt very concerned about weight and understands that \nweight is contributing to various medical problems.  She would \nlike to lose weight.  Her A1c was 5.8 on ___.  She is \ninterested in working to lose weight.

Female w\/ h.o. recurrent pericarditis, reflux, \n?eosinophilic esophagitis presenting with several months of \natypical chest pain.  \n  \n  \n##. Atypical Chest pain: Ms. ___ was referred to ___ for \nevaluation of her atypical chest pain as possible IBD. Pt had \nbeen to several hospitals for her chest pain and was diagnosed \nwith recurrent pericarditis. Upon discussion with pt's \nGastroenterologist and PCP, they did not feel as if her chest \npain was pericarditis and were concerned that it may be \nextraintestinal manifestations of IBD specifically crohns given \nher previous positive IBD serology tests. EKG on admission did \nnot show any signs of pericarditis, GI consult was obtained per \npt's PCP's recommendation. Pt underwent  an EGD and Colonoscopy \nwhich showed no evidence of IBD, CT abd\/pelvis showed on \nevidence of IBD within the small intestines. ESR and CRPs were \nalso sent which were normal, upon history pt also did not \nexhibit any clinical signs of IBD. Other considerations for the \npossible cause of atypical chest pain per pt's PCP included \nautoimmune disease and infectious disease. Both services were \nconsulted, per Rheumatology they did not feel this process was \nautoimmune in nature. They also recommended sending out ___ \nwhich was negative. ID recommended HIV test,  strongyloides, \ntoxocara given the pt's exposure history all tests were again \nnegative. During the hospitalization pt's pain was controlled \nwith initially IV narcotics; as pt appeared to be very sleepy \nafter IV pain medication and requested more IV pain medication \ndespite seeming sleepy she was transitioned to a longer acting \nPO regimen which will be tapered off as an outpt. Given her \nnegative ID, GI and Rheum work-up and improved pain control with \nPO regimen pt was discharged with close follow up with ID, \nRheum, GI, PCP and ___. Although no clear mechanism for \nher chest pain was noted her symptomology closely resembled that \nof recurrent pericarditis which does not always show EKG \nchanges. \n\n##. Transaminitis: Pt was also noted to have transaminitis to \nthe 300s per OSH reports. Differential included infectious \ndisease, medications. Viral hepatitis was ruled out on serology \ntesting at OSH. Viral infection could also include a mild rise \nin transaminases. During her hospitalization her LFTs were \ntrended and were noted to decrease. Medications were also \nconsidered given a conversation with the pt and her family. Pt \nwas prescribed Percocet for her chest pain but endorsed only \ntaking several pills a week. Pt's father was at her bedside and \nstated she had taken a lot more Percocet, per him she had gone \nthrough 40-50 pills over the past few weeks. Pt continued to \ndeny taking that many pain medications. Again unclear as to the \netiology, Acetaminophen level was negative however it is \npossible that this was due to Acetaminophen or a possible viral \ninfection.\n\n##. Pain Control: On admission pt stated she had ___ chest \npain, worse with leaning forward. She was initially given IV \npain medication and then during hospitalization she was \ntransitioned to a longer acting PO regimen. She was instructed \nat time of discharge that the pain medication would not be long \nterm and would be tapered off by her PCP.\n  \n##. Anxiety: During hospitalization pt was very anxious, prior \nto her discharge pt stated that she didnt feel ready for \ndischarge despite her pain being well controlled objectively on \nher PO regimen. Given her inpatient work up was complete and her \npain was well controlled she was told by the primary team that \nshe would be discharged with close follow-up. Pt became \nextremely tearful and stated she wanted to be worked up for \nworms because she had started vomiting 'worms' over the past few \ndays. When challenged as to whether she had shown anyone these \nworms or why she had not told anyone including her nurses, \nprimary medicine team, GI, Rheumatology, ID doctors she became \nvery tearful. She denied any fear of returning home and stated \nshe was safe at home. She was discharged with anxiolytics. She \nwas offered SW and psych consultation to aid with her anxiety \nshe declined both of these services.\n \nMedications on Admission:\nMedications (per Dr. ___:  \n-Zolpidem 10 mg qHS PRN  \n-Lorazepam 0.5 mg BID PRN  \n-Sumatriptan 50 mg PRN Headache  \n-Fluticasone 50 mcg 2 sprays in each nostril once daily  \n.  \nMedications (per ___):  \nPantoprazole 40mg daily  \nColchicine 0.6 daily  \nPercocet 5 2 every ___ hours  \nLorazepam 0.5 ___ tabs at bedtime picked up ___  \n\n \nDischarge Medications:\n1. zolpidem 5 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) \nas needed for insomnia.  \n2. indomethacin 25 mg Capsule Sig: Two (2) Capsule PO TID (3 \ntimes a day).  \n3. pantoprazole 40 mg Tablet, Delayed Release (E.C.)

It was also considered very unlikely to be \nnecrotizing fasciitis given steady improvement in erythema.  He \nhad a PICC line placed and will need to continue vancomycin (no \nmore clinda or imipenem per ID) for ___ weeks total (starting \nwhen it first started receding on ___, complete on ___, \nwhen he has follow-up with ID - ___ at 9:30 am on \n___ will need OPAT weekly labs CBC\/LFTs\/BUN\/Cr\/vanco \ntrough). He was discharged on tylenol and percocet #40 for his \npain, and was instructed to not drink alcohol or drive after \ntaking percocet.\n\n# Anemia\/UGIB: Complained of melena soon after admission, and \nhis hematocrit steadily dropped from 37 to 22 in three days.  He \nunderwent an EGD, which showed a large duodenal clot and \nbleeding duodenal dieulafoy lesion.  He was monitored in the \nFICU for two days for abdominal pain, CT abdomen negative, and \nimproved on simethacone and bowel regimen.  He was placed on \npantoprazole gtt then IV bid, and was discharged on PO bid.  His \nHpylori was negative.  He will need repeat endoscopy in ___ \nweeks, and likely colonoscopy at some point as outpatient.  He \nshould not take NSAIDs and should abstain from alcohol as well.\n\n# gout: had a flare on medial L great toe on ___, typically \ngets flare once per year and it has been approximately one year \nsince his last one.  Because he is not able to get NSAIDs given \nhis recent GI bleed, he was started on prednisone 40mg for one \nday, then 20mg for 3 days (to be completed on ___\n\n# COPD: stable in-house, did well with duonebs standing and prn.\n\n# HTN: stable.

Arterial \ncalcifications, including coronary artery calcifications, and \naortic and dense mitral valve calcifications.  \n.\nEKG ___: Baseline artifact. Regular narrow complex \ntachycardia at 125 per minute with pseudo S waves inferiorly \nmost consistent with A-V nodal re-entrant tachycardia type of \nparoxysmal supraventricular tachycardia. Left axis deviation \nconsistent with left anterior fascicular block. Compared to the \nprevious tracing of ___ paroxysmal supraventricular \ntachycardia is new with previous tracing showing frequent atrial \nectopy. Minuscule R waves or Q waves are again noted inferiorly. \nCannot exclude prior inferior wall myocardial infarction. \nClinical correlation is suggested.  \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nSUBCARINAL MASS: Patient does not have obvious risk factors for \nmalignancy short of her age. She does not drink heaviliy and \ndoes not smoke, and there is no family history of any \nmalignancy. The radiologic differential includes metastasis, \nesophageal cancer, and lymphoma. On further review, she does \nendorse some symptoms concerning for malignancy, such as weight \nloss, loss of appetite, and fatigue. She did have an odd \nauto-diff with 10% \"others\", which were later read as immature \nmonocytes.  IP performed an EBUS and biopsy yesterday that the \npatient tolerated well.  She will follow up in thoracic ___ \nclinic.\n.\nAV NODAL REENTRANT TACHYCARDIA: The patient initially presented \nwith palpitations, which had occurred once before the episode \nshe presented with, and recurred once again during her \nhospitalization.  Her EKGs in the ED and on the floor during \nthese episodes were consistent with AV nodal reentrant \ntachycardia.  She was hemodynamically stable during these \nepisodes, although she was symptomatic with palptiations.  In \nthe ED, she received IV fluids and the episode resolved.  On the \nfloor, she received metoprolol 12.5 mg PO and eventually the \nepisode terminated, although it is not clear if either of these \ninterventions actually caused her to return to a normal rhythm.  \nTSH was checked, which was slightly low, but her free T4 was \nnormal.  Regardless, she was discharged on metoprolol succinate \n25 mg PO daily for prophylaxis.\n.  \nELEVATED D-DIMER: The patient does not have a pulmonary embolism \nor DVT on imaging.\n.  \nHYPOTHYROIDISM: She has a slighltly low TSH with a normal T4, so \nit is unlikely that hyperthyroidism is contributing to her \narrhythmias.  She continued on her home levotyroxine. \n.  \nRULE OUT MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION:  Troponins negative times two.\n.  \nLACTIC ACIDOSIS: Likely secondary to hypovolemia from poor PO \nintake.

The CT scan of \nthe abdomen and pelvis showed patent bowel to the stoma. The \npatient continued to have pain which she attributed to decreased \noutput from the stoma and stricture in the J pouch. Her pain was \ntreated with narcotic medications and she was give intravenous \nhydration. She was monitored closely an the pain continued. The \nwound\/ostomy team placed a red rubber catheter in limb of \nileostomy with stool and gas out however, this quickly because \ndislodged.

Prior to discharge, the \npatient requested a mediation change to Dilaudid or discharge, \nhowever, given her report of dramatic improvment of pain this \nwriter did not see that medication request as appriopriate. The \npatient complained of pain and brusing in the rectal area, \nreasonible after exam under anesthesia and she requested pain \nmedication for the car ride home. She was given 5mg of PO \nOxycodone which she accepted and idocaine jelly to the rectal \narea. She was encoraged to use ice packs to the area when she \narrives home. She was given only a small amount of roxicet at \nher home dose as she stated that she only had a small amount at \nhome as she reported improved pain after the exam. I encoraged \nher to call the office if she develops new pain which requires \nnarcotic medication managment.

PFI !!  \nPFI: Heavy fecal load throughout the descending and sigmoid \ncolon as well as significant amount of feces seen distending the \nrectum. \n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ year old female with longstanding anorexia nervosa, who was \nliving at a residential eating disorder program but refusing to \neat and becoming weak with low blood pressures as well as \ncomplaints of inability to urinate or move her bowels. She was \nhydrated with IV fluids for dehydration and treated as per the \nEating Disorder Protocol while in house. She has a very variable \nstory and has been telling different professional different \nsymptoms. According to the ___, she had not been eating since \nshe was transferred to this unit 5 days ago and seems to have \nbeen testing the limits of this facility by her dietary \nnon-compliance. On D\/W Dr ___ had multiple complaints and \nwhen seen in the ED the report was that she may have been \nfactitiously trying to feign neuro signs and would appear \nfatigued but when not watched she was normal. Other symptoms \nwere only by her report and included not passing urine for 3 \ndays and not having a bowel motion in 12 days. She had evidence \nof fecal loading on her KUB which was in keeping with \nconstipation and was treated with a bowel regimen. She is very \nmanipulative and it has been difficult to interpret whether \nthese self-reported symptoms were bogus\/factitious although the \ndifficulty in her case is that she has had serious previous \nmedical problems. She was reviewed by her O\/P psychiatrist Dr \n___ on ___ and his feeling was to stop trazodone and aim \nfor a short hospital stay once medically stable. She had \ncomplaints regarding possible allergy to casein (this would cut \nout a lot of the dietary supplements and boosts to aid in her \nweight gain) and that this was managed with \"pediatric \nEpiPens\"?? In a patient who has had potentially serious \ntachyarrhythmias giving epinephrine would not be a good idea \nunless this was to treat significant allergy\/anaphylaxis. She \nnoted some episode of vomiting after her Ensure which she said \nwas related to her \"allergies\" but there was no evidence of SOB, \nwheezing or hives. She also shoed evidence of functional \nneurological symptoms or indeed factitious disorder. On transfer \nback from X-ray patient had an episode of staring into space and \nwhen roused by the start of a sternal rub by Nursing Staff she \nappeared to be disoriented. Afterwards she reported that she had \nfallen while staff let her use the bathroom, hit her head twice \nand briefly lost consciousness on the floor although neglected \nto mention this at the time. On my review neurologically, she \nhad an entirely functional\/factitious exam with \"give way\" \nweakness in all 4 limbs, despite normal reflexes and muscle tone \nand the most striking findings were of eye movement examination \nwhere she would initially look to extremes of gaze and then \ninappropriately re-adjust her gaze to make it appear that she \nhad limitation in movement, she also noted abnormal left facial \nsensation and slow tongue movements. She also had a completely \nfunctional cerebellar exam with completely exaggerated \n\"stuttering\" and \"pseudo-clonus\" of heel-shin and on finger-nose \nshe described diplopia and could simply not touch the examiners \nfinger despite having entirely intact coordination. These \nfeatures are concerning as it seems that she has had several \nepisodes of disorientation and pseudo-neurological symptoms \nwhich may easily be mis-interpreted by the untrained observer. \nThese concerns of malignant psychopathy with now \nfunctional\/factitious symptoms were communicated to her \nout-patient psychiatrist, Dr ___ previous in-patient \npsychiatrist Dr ___. Just prior to discharge she complained \nof allergy and that she could not swallow and spoke in an \ninappropriate whisper with normal breath sounds on auscultation \nand no wheeze and appeared to be trying to emulate anaphylaxis. \nShe attributed this to the casein in her Ensure. This passed and \nshe was quickly able to talk normally but gives further credence \nto her functional symptomatology. She was medically cleared and \ntransferred back to the ___ on ___.  \n.  \n# Weakness\/?Syncope: There was no evidence of electrolyte \nabnormality, she had a normal ECG and her weight was higher than \nher previous discharge in ___. However given her poor PO \nintake, the cause of this was likely orthostatic in additional \nto nutritional deficiency and generalised low BP. She was seen \nto be orthostatic on heart rate and no postural BP drop. Patient \nhas had tachyarrythmias in the past but there was no evidence of \nthis on continuous telemetry. She appeared dehydrated and \nreceived IV fluids. She reportedly had syncope for years and \nalso stated that she was getting worked up at ___ in addition \nregarding \"allergies\" although it was not possible to confirm \nthis. She was hydrated and her labs remained stable. She was \ntreated as per the Eating Disorders Protocol while in house. We \ncontinued MVI, Calcium, Vitamin D, B12. She had a possibly \nspurious un-witnessed fall with LOC as is described below.  \n.  \n# Functional\/factitious neurological symptoms\/pseudoseizures: On \ntransfer back from X-ray patient had an episode of staring into \nspace and when roused by the start of a sternal rub by Nursing \nStaff she appeared to be disoriented. Afterwards she reported \nthat she had fallen while staff let her use the bathroom, hit \nher head twice and briefly lost consciousness on the floor \nalthough neglected to mention this at the time. On my review \nneurologically, she had an entirely functional\/factitious exam \nwith \"give way\" weakness in all 4 limbs, despite normal reflexes \nand muscle tone and the most striking findings were of eye \nmovement examination where she would initially look to extremes \nof gaze and then inappropriately re-adjust her gaze to make it \nappear that she had limitation in movement, she also noted \nabnormal left facial sensation and she had inappropriately slow \ntongue movements. She also had a functional cerebellar exam with \nexaggerated \"stuttering\" and \"pseudo-clonus\" of heel-shin and on \nfinger-nose she described diplopia and could simply not touch \nthe examiner's finger despite having entirely intact \ncoordination. These features are concerning as it seems that she \nhas had several episodes of disorientation and \npseudo-neurological symptoms which may easily be mis-interpreted \nby the untrained observer. These concerns of malignant \npsychopathy with now functional\/factitious symptoms were \ncommunicated to her out-patient psychiatrist, Dr ___ \nprevious in-patient psychiatrist Dr ___. She was discharged \nto the ___ on ___.\n.  \n# Urinary Retention: Per ED, the patient did urinate but tried \nto hide this from staff so there was an unclear history. Given \nrisk of infection with Foley catheter, this was removed and \nurine-output was monitored. She had another unwitnessed void. \nmonitor urine output closely. We held Benadryl as there were no \n\"allergies\".  \n.  \n# Constipation: We started a bowel regimen with docusate, senna, \nMiralax. AXR ___ showed heavy fecal load throughout the \ndescending and sigmoid colon as well as significant amount of \nfeces seen distending the rectum. If she does not improve, \nMetoclopramide could be added in the community. \n.  \n# Anorexia Nervosa: She has been very difficult to manage and \nhas had considerable medical problems as a result of this. She \nwas treated with IV fluids and rehydrated for dehydration. She \nwas manipulative and vomited her ensure on ___ complaining \nthat this was due to \"allergies\" and that her mother had similar \nproblems and that she should be treated with pediatric EpiPens. \nShe was not given Benadryl and certainly no EpiPens in the \ncontext of someone with previous VT and other arrhythmias. She \nwas treated with the Eating Disorders protocol. Psychiatry \nreviewed and recommended stopping trazodone as can cause \npostural hypotension. They also wanted if possible to track down \ndetails of her potentially spurious autoimmune workup and \nallergy but this was not possible at this time.

Heart size \nis normal.  \nLungs clear. No pleural abnormality. Healed left middle rib \nfracture. \n\nFINDINGS: Mild atelectasis is noted at the lung bases. There are \nno pleural effusions. Note is made of a left fat-containing \nBochdalek hernia. \n  \nThe heart is normal in size, with trace pericardial effusion. \nRight atrial \npacemaker lead courses in expected position. Calcifications are \nnoted in the mitral annulus and descending thoracic aorta. \n  \nNote is made of a small hiatal hernia. \n  \nABDOMEN: Again seen are multiple hepatic hypodensities measuring \nup to 7 mm in segment VI (4:49), too small to characterize. \nMultiple punctate hepatic calcifications are also present, \nlikely reflecting prior granulomatous disease. Several calcified \nstones are noted within a partially distended gallbladder, \nwithout wall edema or pericholecystic fluid. There is no \nintrahepatic biliary dilatation. The common bile duct is mildly \ndilated up to 8 mm, but tapers smoothly to the head of the \npancreas. The pancreas is unremarkable. The spleen is normal in \nsize, with scattered granulomatous calcifications. \n  \nAgain seen is a 1.7 cm fat-density lesion in the medial limb of \nthe left \nadrenal gland, consistent with adenoma. The right adrenal is \nnormal. The \nkidneys enhance and excrete contrast promptly and symmetrically, \nwithout \nstones, masses, or hydronephrosis. \n  \nPELVIS: The bladder and distal ureters are normal. A 1.6-cm \nexophytic \ncalcified fibroid is noted projecting from the right posterior \nuterine fundus. The ovaries are normal. \n  \nGASTROINTESTINAL: Beginning at the level of the mid jejunum in \nthe left \nupper quadrant (4:100), there is mild diffuse dilation of \nsmall-bowel loops up to 2.7 cm, with internal air-fluid levels. \nTransition point is noted in the left lower quadrant (4:100 and \n500B:15), with relative distal decompression of distal ileal \nloops. However, there is reconstitution of bowel caliber at the \nlevel of the cecum, which is anteriorly folded and mildly \ndilated at 7 cm. A moderate amount of retained fecal material is \nnoted throughout the ascending and transverse colon. Descending \ncolon and rectum are unremarkable. \n  \nA small amount of free fluid is present, concentrated in the \nperihepatic\/perisplenic spaces, and tracking along the left \nparacolic gutter and pelvis. There is no free intraperitoneal \nair to suggest perforation. No pneumatosis or mesenteric\/portal \nvenous gas to indicate ischemia. Scattered prominent \nretroperitoneal and mesenteric lymph nodes are present, \nmeasuring up to 9 mm, and likely reactive. \n  \nCT ANGIOGRAM: Scattered calcifications and soft plaques are \nnoted throughout the descending thoracic and abdominal aorta, \nwith mild stenosis of the renal artery origins. There has been \nsurgical resection and closure of the infrarenal abdominal aorta \nand proximal common iliac arteries. Trace surrounding \nphlegmonous changes are present, without drainable fluid \ncollections. \n  \nThe bones are diffusely demineralized. Mild multilevel \ndegenerative changes are present, with anterior osteophytes and \nfacet arthropathy at multiple levels. There is a chronic \ncompression deformity of L3, with approximately 50% loss of \nheight. Bone graft material is noted at L3-4. There is evidence \nof discitis at L4-5, with extensive irregular endplate \ndestruction, bony fragmentation, and grade 1 anterolisthesis. An \nadjacent fluid collection in the left psoas muscle is stable at \n2.6 x 1.6 cm, with mild peripheral enhancement suggestive of \ninfectious or inflammatory changes. \n  \nChanges of right axillary-bifemoral bypass are present, with \nretrograde \nopacification of the bilateral distal common, external, and \ninternal iliac \narteries. A small fluid collection in the right inguinal region \nis minimally decreased in size at 8 mm, and likely represents a \nseroma or lymphocele.  Scattered inguinal nodes are present, \nmeasuring up to 17 mm on the left and 13 mm on the right, and \nlikely reactive. \n  \nIMPRESSION: \n  \n1. New partial small-bowel obstruction with transition point in \nleft lower \nquadrant, presumably due to post-operative adhesions. Trace \nascites, without evidence of bowel perforation. \n  \n2. L4-5 discitis, with extensive endplate destruction and stable \n2.6 x 1.6 cm left psoas fluid collection. \n  \n3. Changes of infrarenal abdominal aortic and common iliac \nartery resection, \nwith residual post-surgical inflammatory changes. \n  \n4. Patent right axillary-bifemoral graft, with retrograde \nopacification of \nbilateral external and internal iliac arteries. Minimally \ndecreased right \ninguinal fluid collection.  \n  \n5. 1.8 cm left adrenal adenoma. \n  \n6. Cholelithiasis, without acute cholecystitis. \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___:\n\nPt admitted for Abdominal pain.

Pneumonia: Patient was treated for viral vs. bacterial (more \nlikely given focal findings on CXR and recent hospitalization) \npneumonia.  He initially received Tamiflu until influenza A and \nB negative results were obtained.  Given recent hospitalization, \nhe also received ceftaz\/vancomycin for hospial acquired \npneumonia for 3 days.  After being afebrile for 48hrs with \nnegative cultures, patient was transitioned to high dose \nLevofloxacin (adjusted for renal function) for 5 days.  He was \ndischarged with 2 additional days of 250mg PO QD to be completed \non ___.  Various evaluations were used to define the \npathogen without success.  A sputum specimen was determined to \nbe contaminated by upper respiratory secretions. A urine \nlegionella ag was negative and liver function tests were within \nnormal limits. \n.\n2. Diastolic cardiac dysfunction:  Patient has chronic disease \nthought to be a major contributor to his respiratory distress \ngiven clinical setting of recently discontinued diuretic, \ndepedent pulmonary crackles, and visibly volume overloaded with \n1+ pitting edema to the knee.  He has a history of diastolic \nheart failure with EF of 65-70% on last ECHO. Torsemide was \ndiscontinued during and after last hospitalization out of \nconcern for dehydration.  After admission, patient was diuresed \nwith escalating doses of diuretics. Patient was discharged at a \nweight of 180lbs.  Baseline weight was previously reported as \n178lbs.  He was discharged on his home torsemide dose of 20mg PO \ndaily.  Patient will be followed with ___, weight monitoring, \ndietary instructions, and multiple follow-up appointments.\n.\n3. Acute on chronic renal failure: Patient has with chronic \nkidney insufficiency (baseline crt 2.2 in the inpatient setting, \nbut outpatient baseline of 3.0 according to ___ records \nthought to reflect more accurate baseline).  His creatinine \nincreased likely related to dehydration with insensible losses \npoor oral intake with current illness, this is moderately \nsupported by a BUN:Cr ratio of close to 20:1.  Negative \neosinophiluria, lack of predominant fever, and minimal urine \nwhite and red blood cells argued against acute interstitial \nnephritis. Throughout admission he his blood pressure was \nmonitored, nephrotoxins were avoided, and his medications were \nrenally dosed.  His allopurinol and valsartan medications were \nheld during the admission in the setting of ARF to prevent \nexacerbation.  Prior to discharge his valsartan was restarted at \na lower dose (from 160mg\/d to 40mg\/d) per renal consultation.  \nAt admission his Cr increased to 3.5 on ___ and then \ndecreased to 2.9 and 3.0 prior to Discharge which is felt to be \nthe patient's baseline.  The patient will be called by his \nprimary nephrologist's office to schedule follow up.  \n.\n4. Anemia: Patient demonstrated normocytic anemia.  The \nhematocrit decreased from baseline throughout admission, likely \nrelated to phlebotomy and EPO deficiency secondary to renal \ndisease.  Hematocrit dropped throughout admission with a nadar \nof 23.4.  On ___ anemia labs revealed TIBC of 173, Ferritin \nof 151, TRF of 133.\nWe initiated iron supplementaiton to improve anemia and \ndemonstrate persistent anemia despite Ferritin>200 and \nTransferrin Sat>20% in order to allow patient to qualify fro EPO \ntreatment in the future.  A follow-up appointment was arranged \nwith Dr. ___ at ___.  There  anemia of \nchronic disease, inflammation, and phlebotomy components.  \nPatient continued on iron supplementation, may consider EPO with \nNephrologist on outpatient basis.\n.\n7. Diabetes mellitus, type II:  Patient has poorly controlled \ndiabetes with a HgbA1C of 10.1 on ___ and previous seizure \nepisode thought to be precipitated by hyperglycemia.  While in \nthe hospital he recieved between ___ glargine at night and a \nsliding scale.  Blood sugars ranged from 64-280 and were \nconsistently in the 200s and low 300s by ___, except in the \nmornings after we increased Insulin to 15U Glargine QHS.  When \npatient's evening glargine dose was increased to 15U his morning \nfinger sticks decreased to 60-95. He was returned to his home \ndose of glargine, 9U QHS prior to discharge for fear of \nhypoglycemia given reported past episodes and concerns that \nsugars were more elevated than normal for patient in the setting \nof infection.  His insulin regimen should be addressed in the \noutpatient setting given difficulty titrating dosing in the \nsetting of infection.  We continued aspirin and ___ given their \nbenefit in diabetic patients.  \n.\n7. Seizure: There was concern for a recent seizure episode \nthought to be precipitated by hyperglycemia.  Patient did not \ndemonstrate signs or symptoms consistent with seizure activity \nthroughout his admission.  He did not receive any anti-epileptic \nmedications.  He has follow up with neurology.\n.\n8. Hypertension: Patient was continued on minoxidil and \nmetoprolol per his home dosing regimens.  Valsartan was \ndecreased per renal consult, to be re-evaluated at follow up \nappointment.\n.\n9. Hyperthyroidism (due to chronic kidney disease):  This \npatient was kept on zemplar for secondary hyperparathyroidism.\n.\n10.

Cytologic evaluation was negative for malignant cells \nand no microorganisms were seen on gram stain or culture. \n\nAfter the procedure her pain had improved, though not \ncompletely. Our team believed this was most likely due to the \nmultiple cysts that were not drained. We spoke extensively with \nthe patient regarding the utility of further aspiration \nprocedures.  We noted that is very difficult to determine which \ncysts are generating her pain and that the cysts can \nre-accumulate fluid.  Also explained the risk of infection and \nbleeding with each additional procedure.  Given that her pain \nwas \"tolerable\", she elected to defer any additional procedures \nat this time.  We told her this can be readdressed as an \noutpatient if her pain level changes.  \n\nAdditionally, patient had diarrhea for ___ days after her \nprocedure.

Mild cardiomegaly without \npulmonary \nedema.  The endotracheal tube projects with its tip 6 cm above \nthe carina.  The course of the nasogastric tube is unremarkable, \nthe tip is not included in the image.  The right PICC line is in \ncorrect position.  There are widespread bilateral severe \nparenchymal opacities and consolidation, right much more than \nleft, some of which have a nodular component, notably in the \nright upper lobe. There appears to be a small right pleural \neffusion.  No left pleural effusion. No pneumothorax.  Mild \ntortuosity of the thoracic aorta. \n.\n___ Echo\nThe left atrium is normal in size. The estimated right atrial \npressure is at least 15 mmHg. There is mild regional left \nventricular systolic dysfunction with focal basal inferior \nhypokinesis. The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = \n50%). The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with \nborderline systoic function. There are three aortic valve \nleaflets. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Physiologic mitral \nregurgitation is seen (within normal limits). There is mild \npulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial \neffusion. \nIMPRESSION: Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, \nc\/w CAD. Dilated right ventricle with borderline systolic \nfunction. At least mild pulmonary hypertension.\n.\n___ Echo\nNo atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The \nestimated right atrial pressure is at least 15 mmHg. There is \nmild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left \nventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal technical \nquality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully \nexcluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is probably \nnormal (LVEF>50%). There is no ventricular septal defect. The \nright ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with depressed free \nwall contractility. There is abnormal systolic septal \nmotion\/position consistent with right ventricular pressure \noverload. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but \naortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. \nThe mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The tricuspid \nvalve leaflets are mildly thickened. Tricuspid regurgitation is \npresent but cannot be quantified. There is moderate pulmonary \nartery systolic hypertension (RA pressure estimate > 15 mmHg \nadded to TR gradient). There is a trivial\/physiologic \npericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of \ntamponade. \nCompared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, \nthe RV appears less dilated. RV systolic function appears \nsimilar (depressed). Focal inferior LV hypokinesis is no longer \nappreciated.  \n.\n___ CT chest:\n1. Diffuse area of ground glass with peribronchial consolidation \nand large \nPreliminary Reportsubpleural consolidation at the lung bases is \ncompatible with viral infection. \n2. Large mediastinal nodes are mainly in the right upper and \nsubcarinal \nstatins. Hilar lymphadenopathy is difficult to assess due to \nlack of contrast. \n3. There is no pleural effusion.  \n4. Bilateral pleural plaques and pleural thickening might be due \nto asbestos exposure. \n.\nRUE U\/S: ___.  Nonocclusive thrombus seen within the right internal \njugular, axillary, basilic, and brachial veins.   \n2.  Right internal jugular central venous line. \n.\nCXR ___: In comparison with the study of ___, there is a \ncontinued and \npossibly progressive opacification involving much of the right \nlung, \nconsistent with clinical diagnosis of asymmetric pulmonary \nedema, pleural \neffusion and compressive atelectasis at the base.  However, in \nthe appropriate clinical setting, supervening pneumonia would \nhave to be seriously considered. \n. \nDischarge labs\n___ 02:07AM BLOOD WBC-8.2 RBC-3.00* Hgb-8.3* Hct-27.0* \nMCV-90 MCH-27.8 MCHC-30.9* RDW-15.0 Plt ___\n___ 02:07AM BLOOD ___ PTT-27.2 ___\n___ 02:07AM BLOOD Glucose-163* UreaN-40* Creat-3.6* Na-143 \nK-3.4 Cl-103 HCO3-29 AnGap-14\n___ 02:07AM BLOOD Calcium-8.7 Phos-3.7 Mg-2.0\n___ 09:39AM BLOOD HBsAg-NEGATIVE HBsAb-NEGATIVE \nHBcAb-NEGATIVE\n___ 11:16AM BLOOD HIV Ab-NEGATIVE\n___ 12:22AM BLOOD Type-ART pO2-102 pCO2-61* pH-7.37 \ncalTCO2-37* Base XS-7 Comment-TRACH MASK\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ M with PMH DMII, paroxysmal afib, hypertension, ___ \ntransferred from ___ for further management of \nacute hypoxemic\/hypercapnic respiratory failure, complicated by \nARDS, now improving with trach and PEG in place. \n.\n# Acute respiratory failure\/ARDS: Pt transferred from OSH after \nintubation on ___.

The patient reports that his visiting nurse took \nhis blood two days ago, and then his doctor called saying that \nthe patient was likely dehydrated and that his kidney function \nwas reduced with a creatinine of 3.8 (baseline 2.3).  The \npatient thought he likely was dehydrated as he had not been able \nto urinate normally two days ago.  He feels like he has to \nurinate, but is unable to.  He says that normally it takes him a \nwhile to urinate when he feels the urge, but he denies a history \nof frank obstruction.  Though the doctor instructed the patient \nto come to the hospital two days ago, the patient waited until \nlast night to come.  He admits to eating and drinking less the \npast few days.

It was elevated in the ED on hospital day 1 \nto 3.8 then has trended down to 3.2 at the day of discharge.  \nThe most likely cause of the patient's acute on chronic renal \nfailure was due to AIN from cephalexin and\/or Bactrim which he \nwas being treated for right leg cellulitis.  He had eosinophils \nin his urine and blood, with mild proteinuria \n(protein:creatinine ratio of 0.2). The patient's FeUrea was 46% \nwhich makes unlikely to be due to prerenal causes.  The timeline \nfits with AIN, as the patient began taking the antibiotics about \n10 days ago. He stated to have poor po intake in the last few \ndays making pre-renal causes possible contributory to worsening \nkidney fx. He also had complains of difficulty urinating and has \nhx of BPH, renal US r\/o hydronephritis and other post renal \nreasons. He was given gentle hydration due to the CHF hx, \nantibiotics were stopped and he was given one dose of \nvanocomycin to tx cellulitis. IV lasix were initially held and \nrestarted prior to d\/c given that creatine was close to \nbaseline. He will have f\/u labs as outpatient 1 day after \ndischarge.\n  \n.\n# HYPERKALEMIA: Patient's K+ was elevated to 5.3 on admission \nlikely due to worsening renal function. His k trended down to \n4.5 after treatment with Kayexalate.  K was 4.8 at time of \ndischarge.  The patient was placed on telemetry for monitoring, \nand he was in Afib with very occasional PVCs. \n.\n# BPH: Patient complains of increased difficulty urinating \nrecently.  He had renal US with no hydronephrosis. He is able to \nurinate with no difficulty while hospitalized. He was continued \non his home dose of tamsulosin. \n.\n# LLE CELLULITIS: Pt has hx of chronic venous stasis and was \nrecently hospitalized ___ for LLE cellulitis.  Patient \nreceived 10 of 14 days of antibiotics,  Bactrim and Keflex. Both \nantibiotics were discontinued due to worsen renal fx as noted \nabove. His left ___ wound as per patient appears much improved. \nHe has small healing ulcers on his L shin area. Otherwise \ncellulitis appears to be resolved. He was given one dose of \nvancomycin and cipro at admission which may stay on his system \nfor a few days. No other antibiotics at this time. He will \ncontinue to have ___ to do drsg changes.\n.\n# SYSTOLIC CHF: Stable during hospitalization.  No evidence of \npulmonary edema on exam.  He has ___ edema at baseline.  His \nLasix was held as described above and was restarted prior to \ndischarge.  The patient's atenolol was continued during the \n___ hospital stay. \n.\n# HTN: Chronic problem.  Stable since admission.  The patient's \nhome atenolol was continued during his hospital stay.\n.\n# CAD \/ HYERLIPIDEMIA: Chronic problem, currently stable.  The \npatient's statin and his atenolol were continued during his \nhospitalization.  The patient is not on aspirin as he has a \nhistory of GI bleeds.\n.\n# ANEMIA: Chronic problem, stable since admission.  Patient's \nbaseline HCT is ~33.  On hospital day 2 it was 30.3, and on \nhospital day 3 it was 29.0, most likely resulting from \nhemodilution.  There was no evidence of active bleeding. \n.\n# THROMBOCYTOPENIA: Chronic problem, stable since admission.  \nPatient's baseline platelet count is ~105.  On hospital day 2, \ncount was 97.  No current evidence of bleeding.  On hospital day \n3 the platelet count was 106.\n.\n# CHRONIC BACK PAIN: Chronic problem, currently stable.  \nPatient's home acetaminophen, oxycontin, gabapentin, and \nlidocaine patch were continued during his hospital stay.\n.\n# GERD \/ Hx GI BLEEDS: Continued home dose of omeprazole \n.\n# GOUT: continue home dose of allopurinol \n.\n# A-FIB: Rate controlled on atenolol.  No aspirin \/ warfarin due \nto history of GI bleeds.  \n.\n# DM: FSG were <200 during the hospitalization.  Patient is \nnormally on Januvia, but that's not available at the pharmacy.  \nPatient was controlled with insulin sliding scale during the \nhospitalization.\n.\n# FUNGAL INFECTION: Patient has evidence of tinea pedis.  He was \nstarted on clotrimazole cream for this problem.\n.\n\n# FEN: low ___ diet. repleted lytes prn.\n# Access: PIV\n# PPx: heparin SC, bowel regimen given narcotics, home PPI\n# Code: full\n# Dispo: home with ___ and ___ \n\n \nMedications on Admission:\n1.
