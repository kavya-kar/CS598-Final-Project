Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system \ndemonstrated single vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA, \nLAD, and \nLCx were free of angiographically significant disease. There was \na \nthrombotic total occlusion of the mid-RCA with no \ncollateralization. \n2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed normal resting systemic \n\narterial pressure. \n\n___ (___): The left atrium is normal in size. Left \nventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There \nis mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with \nhypokinesis of the inferior and inferolateral walls. There is a \nfocal defect in the basal inferior septum on 2D and color \nDoppler with continuous left-to-right flow c\/w a post infarction \nventricular septal defect (VSD). The remaining left ventricular \nsegments contract normally. (LVEF 50%). Intrinsic left \nventricular systolic function may be more depressed given the \ninterventricular flow). Right ventricular chamber size and free \nwall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (?#) appear \nstructurally normal with good leaflet excursion. There is no \naortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The \nmitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Mild to moderate \n(___) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary \nartery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. \n\nCXR (___): Current study demonstrates top normal heart as \nwell as bilateral hilar enlargement and pulmonary edema. The \nfindings might potentially represent a new acute mitral \nregurgitation with increasing pulmonary venous pressure and \npresence of newly developed pulmonary edema. Small bilateral \npleural effusions are noted. There is no pneumothorax. \n\n___ (___): The left atrium and right atrium are normal in \ncavity size. There is mild symmetric left ventricular \nhypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild regional left \nventricular systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of the \nbasal half of the inferior and inferolateral walls.

Normal left ventricular cavity size with normal global LVEF \nof 65% albeit severely depressed effective forward LVEF of 20%. \nSevere hypokinesis to akinesis of the mid to basal inferoseptal \nand inferior walls. \n2. Transmural of late gadolinium enhancement in the inferoseptal \nwall, and 45% non-transmural late gadolinium enhancement in the \ninferior wall extending into the inferolateral wall, consistent \nwith myocardial infarction and low (inferoseptal wall) to \nintermediate (inferior wall) likelihood of functional recovery \nafter revascularization. The late gadolinium enhancement \ndemonstrates a microvascular obstruction-type pattern. The \ninfarct size was quantified at 18.2 g, which represents 21% of \nthe total myocardial mass. \n3. Increased T2 signal in these segments, consistent with \nedema\/inflammation and acute\/subacute timing of infarction \n(within 2 weeks). \n4. Myocardial salvage index, representing the difference between \nthe area at risk (T2) and the infarct size (late gadolinium \nenhancement) divided by the area at risk, calculated at 53%. \n5. Infarct-related muscular ventricular septal defect in the mid \nto basal \ninferoseptal wall measuring 7 mm in the long-axis direction, and \n6-9 mm in the short-axis direction (9 mm at the mouth on the \nleft ventricular size of the septum, and slightly tapering to 6 \nmm on the right ventricular side of the septum). \n6. Ischemic mitral regurgitation with mild posterior leaflet \ntethering. \n7. Normal right ventricular cavity size with depressed RVEF of \n39%. Global \nright ventricular hypokinesis with dyskinesis of the distal \nsegments. Late \ngadolinium enhancement in the inferior right ventricular wall, \nconsistent with right ventricular myocardial infarction. \nSystolic flattening of the \ninterventricular septum, consistent with elevated right \nventricular systolic pressure. \n8. The indexed diameters of the ascending and descending \nthoracic aorta were normal. The indexed diameter of the main \npulmonary artery was normal. \n9. Left atrial enlargement. \n10. A note is made of dependent patchy areas of consolidation \nare identified in the lung bases, right greater than left, with \na focal area of nodularity in the right mid lung measuring 2 cm \nin craniocaudal dimension. However, there is no correlate on \nprior chest radiograph. Findings are likely the sequelae of \npulmonary edema, though aspiration or pneumonia should be \nconsidered in the appropriate clinical circumstance. Recommend \nfollow-up chest radiograph after acute illness to document \nresolution. A note is also made of punctate non-enhancing \nlesions in both kidneys, likely small simple cysts. \n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ y\/o woman with STEMI and total RCA occlusion s\/p DES \ncomplicated by post-infarct ventricular septal perforation. \n\n# STEMI: Pt had 100% RCA occlusion just distal to the acute \nmarginal takeoff, now s\/p DES with restoration of flow to the \ndistal RCA and PDA (R dominant). She was started on ASA, Plavix, \nAtorvastatin, metoprolol and lisinopril during her hospital \ncourse. ___ showed mild regional left ventricular systolic \ndysfunction with severe hypokinesis of the basal half of the \ninferior and inferolateral walls. Immediately following PCI she \nwas in 2:1 heart block, which subsequently evolved to Wenckebach \nand 1:1 conduction. She remained hemodynamically stable \nthroughout and was discharged home with cardiology and PCP \nfollow up. \n\n# VSD: Physical exam on admission to the CCU revealed a new \nIII\/VI systolic murmur heard thoughout the precordium concerning \nfor new VSD\/MR. ___ showed VSD, cardiac MRI later showed 3:1 \nshunt fraction, normal RV size with free wall hypokinesis and \nelevated PA pressures. Her O2 sat remained >93% on RA throughout \nher course and she was given diuresis for reducing pulmonary \nedema and shunt, and minimizing pulmonary hypertension.  Blood \npressure was also optimized to decrease afterload and maximize \nforward flow.  The definite treatment will require surgical \nrepair of the interventricular septum defect. Percutaneous VSD \nclosure may also be an option. \n\nOUTPATIENT ISSUES:\n- F\/U WITH CT SURGERY\/INTERVENTIONAL CARDIOLOGY\n- Adjust lasix 80 mg po qd \n- Should have RHC to assess shunt function which could help \ndecide whether patient needs to have her shunt fixed\n\n# A-fib: Pt was found to have a period of unsustained \nsymptomatic A-fib, lasting ~30 mins.  This could be a result of \nchanges in RA volume and dynamics.  Given patient's already \ncompromised CO, atrial kick is necessary to maintain adequate \nMAP.  Amiodarone was started for rhythm control. She was \ncontinued on metoprolol for rate control.  \n\nCHRONIC DIAGNOSES: \nDM: Pt has documented hx of diabetes, controlled by Pioglitizone \nprior to admission.  She was covered with ISS during this \nhospitalization. She was restarted on pioglitizone prior to \ndischarge.\n\n# HTN - Her home Verapamil was held and she was started on \nMetoprolol and Lisinopril with SBP goal in the ___ given the \nlack of mortality benefit of CCB (especially verapamil)\n  \n# GERD - Patient has a documented history of GERD, and takes \nomeprazole at home. Omeprazole was stopped in setting of plavix \nwhile ranitidine was started at 150 mg po qhs. \n\n# HLD: She was started on atorvastatin 80 mg po qdaily (PROVE \ntrial) but it was decreased to 40 mg po qdaily given she was on \nmultiple medications (amiodarone) which would uptitrate her \nstatin dose putting her at risk for rhabdomyolysis. \n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES: \n- Pt maintained a full code during this admission\n- Pt has follow up with Dr. ___ in one week and CT \nsurgery in 2 weeks\n \nMedications on Admission:\n- Vit D 50,000U every other ___\n- Verapamil 240mg qday\n- Omeprazole 20mg qday\n- Clonazepam 0.5mg po qhs\n- Pioglitizone 30mg qday\n- Pregalbin 25mg qday\n- Ultram 50mg prn back pain\n \nDischarge Medications:\n1. aspirin 325 mg Tablet, Delayed Release (E.C.)

The blockage in your arteries was opened and a stent was placed in one of your coronary arteries to help keep it open. We also treated you with several medications to reduce the risk of both another heart attack and of your heart becoming weak from having had a heart attack. Your heart also suffered a complication from your heart attack in which one of the walls between the different chambers of your heart ruptured, allowing blood to flow in a direction it normally would not flow. This is a serious complication and requires repair. You were evaluated by our interventional cardiologists as well as our cardiac surgeons who felt that it would be best to postpone correcting this problem until you have had a bit more time to recover from your heart attack. We have changed some of your medications and started you on several new medications."}

She has a very high insulin requirements, which she takes \nregularly, denies dietary indiscretion (actually reports \nanorexia with weight loss). During this hospitalization, she had \nvolatile BS during this stay - likely due to multiple factors: \nresolution of biliary obstruction, erratic kidney function (now \nnl Cr), recent wt loss, and most importantly ___ sx.

He was evaluated by neurology, \nhowever, CSF with 1WBC was not concerning for meningeal \ninfection. Workup revealed mildly positive UA with elevated \nprotein and spec ___, but negative nitrites and leukocyte \nesterase; in the absence of dysuria UTI was thought very \nunlikely. The patient was evaluated by infectious disease and an \nextensive workup was sent for tick-borne illnesses and \narboviruses; this revealed neg Lyme, HIV, Ehrlichia, EBV, CMV, \nCSF gram stain and culture, with further tests (Rickettsia, \nLeptospira) pending. The patient was started on a 14-day course \nof IV doxycycline as empiric treatment for tick-borne bacterial \nillness. CXR in the ED revealed subtle RLL infiltrate and \n___ LAD, however since he was without cough or other \nrespiratory symptoms and with good O2 sat on room air, pulmonary \ninfection was thought unlikely. When his fevers, headache, and \nnausea had not significant improved on the doxycycline by HD2, \nhe underwent non-contrast chest CT as follow-up for his CXR. \nThis revealed a dense RLL pneumonia with reactive mediastinal \nLAD. He was started on a 7-day course of IV levofloxacin for \ncommunity-acquired pneumonia. He was unable to produce an \ninduced sputum sample without oropharyngeal contamination. He \ndeveloped a mild cough but his respiratory status otherwise \nremained stable and his fever curve trended downwards and by \ndischarge he had been afebrile for over 36 hours. Blood cultures \nx4 and urine cultures x2 remained negative. He was transitioned \nto PO antibiotics with planned total course of levofloxacin for \n7 days (last day ___ and doxycycline for 14 days (last day \n___ and discharged home afebrile and in stable condition. \n\n#HEADACHE - The patient was admitted to the service with severe \nheadache, thought to be mainly post-LP headache combined with \neffects of his illness and fever. He had initially complained of \nphotophobia on admission but this quickly resolved. His pain was \ncontrolled with alternating IV morphine and IV dilaudid along \nwith Fioricet, with care not to exceed maximum doses allowed for \nhis renal impairment and transaminitis.  Dilaudid was ultimately \ndiscontinued as it was contributing to his nausea and vomiting.  \nOnce he was taking POs, he was transitioned to oxycodone and \nfioricet. He had initially complained of increased pain with \nsitting up, so anesthesia was called for potential blood patch \nfor post-LP headache, however they were reluctant to do this \nwhile he was febrile. His headache improved on oxycodone and \nfioricet and he rated it as ___ before discharge. He was \ndischarged home with 10 tablets of 5mg oxycodone along with \nacetaminophen for residual headache.  It is anticipated that his \nheadache will continue to improve overtime, and he was advised \nto take narcotics only when necessary and to taper use of it to \nprevent potential rebound headache.\n\n#ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: The patient presented with increased \nCreatinine to 2.1 (baseline 1.05 -1.3) likely due to \nintravascular volume depletion\/pre-renal given low  FeNa, ___ \nseveral days of nausea and vomiting and decreased PO intake.  In \naddition, he was found to have elevated CK.  Patient was given \nIVF while in the hospital.  His Cr improved over the course of \nadmission to 1.3. Renally cleared medications were minimized \nduring his admission and he had good urine output throughout his \nstay.  He was adviced to avoid taking the OTC supplement while \nhe continues to have ARF.\n\n#TRANSAMINITIS - The patient presented with a mild transaminitis \nof ALT 115 AST 79 (baseline: normal LFTs) and normal TBili, with \nsubsequent improvement to AST and ALT in the ___. The patient \ninitial mild RUQ tenderness which quickly resolved. He had a \nnegative viral hepatitis panel, mildly elevated ferritin to 531 \n(likely acute phase reaction), and negative ___ and ANCA. RUQ \nultrasound was unremarkable except for one 9mm hepatic cyst. The \nelevation in enzymes was thought likely due to regular home use \nof several supplements, the safety profiles of which are \nunknown. The patient's ALT and AST remained generally stable \nthroughout admission.  He was recommended to avoid taking his \nOTC supplements while he continues to have transaminitis to \navoid potential further injury.\n\n#RHABDOMYOLYSIS.  Likely related to the underlying infectious \netiology.  Improved with fluid hydration.  \n\n#NAUSEA - The patient had significant nausea throughout his \nhospital stay, likely ___ PNA and fever, and later thought to be \naggravated by IV hydromorphone that was used for headache. His \nnausea was treated with IV ondansetron and phenergan and PR \nprochlorperazine with good response. His diet was slowly \nadvanced and by discharge he was tolerating solid food. He was \ndischarged with PO ondansetron and promethazine for residual \nnausea at home. \n\nChronic issues: \nNone\n\nTransitional issues: \n#FOLLOW-UP: \n-___ was contacted on the day of patient's discharge \nto inform of the hospital course as well as the importance to \nhave follow up for patient given his lab abnormalities (stable \nand slowly improving) and headache.\n-Primary care: Patient indicated that he no longer sees primary \ncare care at ___.  Instead, he reports seeing ___ at \n___.  He was instructed to call ___ on \n___ after discharge to set up urgent care follow up given the \nrecent hospitalization.

You had a heart catheterization, which showed blockages in your right coronary artery. Three stents were placed to open the blockage, and improve blood flow to your heart. You were started on Aspirin and Plavix. Aspirin and Plavix are used to decrease the risk of clot formation in your stent. You will take Aspirin indefinitely, and Plavix for at least one year. Do not stop taking Plavix until told to do so only by your Cardiologist. Stopping Plavix prematurely may increase your risk of a life threatening heart attack. After your procedure, your heart rate and blood pressure were unstable, so you were closely monitored overnight in the CCU. You were transferred out to the floor when you were stable. You were also started on Atorvastatin to manage your heart disease and cholesterol. Your lipid panel and liver function will be monitored periodically."}

At that time, her WBC \ncount was 397, HgB 3.3, LDH 781, haptoglobin <10 and she was \ntransferred to ___ MICU for further treatment. She was treated \nwith high dose steroids and 4 U pRBCs as well as rasburicase and \nallopurinol for hyperuricemia. She did not receive \nplasmaphoresis in the MICU, as it is likely that her AMS was due \nto profound anemia rather than leukostasis. Troponins were also \npositive in the ICU which is thought to be most consistent with \ntype II NSTEMI in the setting of profound anemia. CT abdomen \nrevealed diffuse lymphadenopathy. Peripheral smear and flow \ncytometry were consistent with new diagnosis of chronic \nlymphocytic leukemia. Direct coombs was positive for IgG (3+), \nwarm hemolytic anemia. G6PD negative. She has been treated with \nRituxan (beginning ___ and Bendamustine (beginning ___ as well \nas high dose steroids. Hemolysis labs (LD and Tbili) have \nsubsequently improved and we have started to taper her steroids. \nHer hyperuricemia has also resolved with treatment and \nallopurinol discontinued. \n\nAdditionally, while admitted she began complaining of increased \npain in lower extremities, so a Doppler U\/S was ordered. U\/S on \n___ showed completely occlusive thrombus within the left \npopliteal vein and also areas of thrombosis bilaterally in the \ncalf veins. Patient had not been on prophylactic anticoagulation \npreviously due to thrombocytopenia. There was some concern that \nthis thrombosis was secondary to HIT but heparin antibodies are \nnegative. She received 2 days of Fondaparinux while HIT was a \nconsideration.

There, your red blood cell count was very low and you were transferred to ___ for further treatment. Here, we found that you have leukemia. Leukemia is a disease which causes your body to make too many white blood cells which don't work correctly. These abnormal white blood cells can cause your body to start breaking down your red blood cells. This is why you had such a low red blood cell count when you came into the hospital. To treat your leukemia we gave you two medications through your veins called Rituximab and Bendamustine. You tolerated these medications very well. These medicines have helped decrease the number of abnormal white blood cells that you have in your blood. We also gave you steroids. These steroids have slowed down the your body from breaking down your red blood cells. You still are breaking down your red blood cells, but much more slowly than when you came into the hospital."}

Regional left ventricular wall \nmotion is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is \nnormal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall \nmotion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear \nstructurally normal with good leaflet excursion. Trace aortic \nregurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly \nthickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. No masses or \nvegetations are seen on the mitral valve, but cannot be fully \nexcluded due to suboptimal image quality. No masses or \nvegetations are seen on the tricuspid valve, but cannot be fully \nexcluded due to suboptimal image quality. The pulmonary artery \nsystolic pressure could not be determined. There is no \npericardial effusion. \nIMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. No echocardiographic \nevidence of endocarditis. If clinically indicated, a \ntransesophageal echocardiogram may better assess for valvular \nvegetations. Preserved biventricular cavity size and \nregional\/global systolic function. Trivial aortic regurgitation. \n \n\n___ EGD:\nNo esophageal varices were noted. No bleeding or high risk \nsigns. Overall normal esophagus.Mild erythema and congestion \nwith a mosiac pattern seen in the body of the stomach consistent \nwith mild portal hyptertensive gastropathy. No gastric or fundic \nvarices were seen. There was multiple areas of punctate \npatechiae noted in the antrum with no active bleeding or \nerosions noted. This may be secondary to portal hypertensive \ngastropathy vs gastritis.\nNormal deuodenum. Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the \nduodenum\n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ with PMH significant for cirrhosis of unclear etiology \n(decompensated with known visualized esophageal varices, ascites \nand pulmonary hypertension), chronic obstructive pulmonary \ndisease, seizure disorder, essential tremor, motorvehicular \ncrash in ___ with resulting impaired mobility (wheelchair-bound \nmostly), PVD, depression, history of DVT, morbid obesity, \nchronic lymphedema with venous stasis changes and pancytopenia \nnow presenting from ___ with recent admission \nfor HCAP (treated with Zosyn) now with Proteus and E.coli \nbacteremia and sepsis from a presumed intra-abdominal source \ncomplicated by worsening pancytopenia, and acute on chronic \nanemia.\n\n# Sepsis - Recently admitted in ___ to ___ \nwith HCAP and treated with Zosyn (ending ___ with interval \nimprovement. Returned with fevers and found to hve Proteus and \nE.coli bacteremia for which he received Zosyn IV initially and \ntransitioned to Ceftriaxone (___). Required intermittent pressor \nsupport and volume resuscitation with improvement. Source of \ninfection presumed to be intra-abdominal and potentially from \nspontaneous bacterial peritonitis. C.diff negative. CXR\/CT \nimaging notes significant ascites, splenomegaly and gallstones \nwithout obstruction. HCAP another possibility but appears to be \nimproving - has residual pleural effusion but minimal symptoms. \nU\/A (___) negative. Following speciation of his bacteremia \norganisms he was treated with IV Ceftriaxone with a planned \n14-day course.  Surveillance blood cultures NGTD, TTE no \nendocarditis\/mass.  As patient is refusing PICC, discussed \npossible PO regimens with ID.  14 days IV ABX are indicated for \nGNR bacteremia.  If we are unable to pursue this standard of \ncare, oral Bactrim or cefpodoxime would be options given the AJH \nsensitivities.  This might be reasonable given surveillance \ncultures have been negative and we presume the SBP source is now \ncontrolled.  Bactrim less preferred given risk of marrow \nsuppression.  Discharged on cefpodoxime to complete course \nthrough ___.  Plan repeat blood cultures ___ to confirm \ntreatment.  Our Liver team suggests starting Cipro 250mg daily \nafter treatment is complete to prevent SBP.\n\n# Presumed gastrointestinal bleeding - No overt bleeding \nreported. Initial hemoglobin 6 g\/dL at ___, received 6 units of \npRBCs and 2 units of platelets at ___. Baseline chronic anemia \nwith hemoglobin in the ___ g\/dL range. Reportedly guaiac \npositive. Esophageal varices noted on recent imaging, however \nEGD negative yesterday with evidence of  portal hypertensive \ngastropathy vs gastritis.  No indication for nadolol.\n\n# Decompensated cirrhosis - Unclear etiology at this point. \nSuspect possible NASH cirrhosis vs. alcoholic vs. HCV (however, \nAb testing negative); LFTs reassuring, but has evidence of \nsynthetic dysfunction with regards to the liver. MELD 17 on \nadmission. No varices, however does have portal HTN and trace \nascites. Previously followed by Dr. ___ ___ \n___, but not recently. Work-up has included: A1AT-Ab \n(negative), ceruloplasmin normal, AMA normal, AFP normal, iron \nstudies normal.  Now with concern for SBP being treated \nempirically.  Smooth muscle Ab positive with low 1:20 titer, \nANCA negative, ___ negative.  Our Hepatology team followed the \npatient during this admission, recommended starting Cipro 250mg \ndaily for SBP Px but no other changes to his regimen.  No \nindication for nadolol as no varices noted on EGD.\n\n# Pancytopenia - Has had pancytopenia since ___ (per ___ \nrecords) thrombocytopenia since ___. Baseline WBC 2.6, HCT 24% \nand platelets of 36. Evaluated by hematology at ___ who felt his \ndecompensated cirrhosis and hypersplenism combined with \ninfection were the most likely source of his worsening cell \ncounts. Other considerations would be MDS vs. medications \n(antibiotics) vs. toxins. Review of peripheral smear was \nnegative.\n\n# Seizure disorder - continued levetiracetam dosing.\n# Depression - mood appears stable, continue fluoxetine.  Held \nlorazepam given concern for encephalopathy while hospitalized.\n# HTN - continue metoprolol, Lasix, spironolactone\n\nTRANSITIONAL CARE ISSUES:\n- Please continue cefpodoxime through ___. \n- Please draw blood cultures ___ days after completion of \nantibiotics ___ or ___) to ensure clearance of infection.\n- If patient clinically worsens or develops fever\/chills, please \nreturn to hospital to resume IV antibiotics, likely with \nceftriaxone.\n- Please book Liver follow-up within 1 month.\n- Will need hepatitis A\/B vaccination as outpatient\n\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

You underwent multiple imaging studies including CT scan and x-rays of your leg, which did not show evidence of fracture or dislocation. You also had ultrasound to exclude blood clot. Your muscle enzymes were normal and did not suggest serious muscle damage. Your pain is most likely musculoskeletal pain. You were seen by the physical therapists, and they recommended rehab. You also had low sodium levels, likely from mild dehydration. This improved with fluids. You were noted to have bacteria in your urine, although you did not have symptoms consistent with urinary tract infection. Nonetheless, you were treated with a course of antibiotics by mouth."}

Described \nas the \"right side of the room was cut in half\", no true vision \nloss. Immediately prior to this, he experienced some dizziness \nand lightheadedness while sitting, when attempting to stand he \ndrifted forward and caught himself without an actual fall. His \nsymptoms resolved after standing. He went to the ED and his \nsymptoms were largely resolved, his NIHSS was 0. His general and \nneurologic review of systems was otherwise unremarkable. His \nneurologic exam was notable for poor vision (right ___, left \n___, blurry right-sided vision when left eye covered, full \nvisual fields, normal fundoscopic exam, slight right arm \npronation, and slightly wide based gait (see below #gait \ndisorder). He had a brain MRI that was negative for acute or \nprior stroke (notably, ADC demonstrated questionable bright \nlesion in L basal ganglia area, per review with neuroradiology \nlikely volume averaging, not stroke), CTA does with significant \ncarotid atherosclerosis. While his monocular symptoms are \ncertainly concerning for transient ischemic event, particularly \nan atherothrombolic event, this is unlikely given reassuring \nvisual exam and MRI, as well as a history that does not suggest \ntrue vision loss. His serum risk factors for stroke were LDL 91, \nHgA1c 5.5. He was started on aspirin and his home simvastatin \ndose was increased. Other explanations for his vision changes \ninclude poor baseline vision given age. Low suspicion for \namaurosis fugax per description of event, or temporal arteritis \ngiven normal inflammatory markers and lack of headache, temporal \npain. Given low suspicion for ischemic event, ophthalmology \nevaluated the patient and found no occular pathology.\n\n#Gait disorder\n#Peripheral Neuropathy\nPatient with longstanding history of mild peripheral neuropathy \nof unclear etiology and gait instability.

Started heparin gtt and \ntransitioned to apixaban. \n\nACUTE ISSUES\n=============\n#Left femoral, popliteal DVT Treatment\nPer records, patient has a long-standing history of atrial \nfibrillation but was not on anticoagulation until 2 weeks ago \nwhen he was started after a preop evaluation for cataract \nsurgery. Patient was never therapeutic on warfarin despite \nincreasing doses up to 15 mg daily. He presented to the ED on \n___ with 3 days of worsening lower extremity swelling and left \nleg erythema and pain. Doppler US w\/ occlusive thrombus in the \nmid and distal left femoral vein and popliteal vein, \nnonocclusive thrombus in the proximal left femoral vein and \nproximal left deep femoral vein. He was started on a heparin \ndrip in the ED and vascular surgery was consulted for possible \nthrombectomy. Patient had good perfusion and easily palpable \npulses in distal extremities and therefore vascular did not feel \nany need for urgent thrombectomy. Recommended medical treatment. \nPatient was admitted to medicine and was transitioned from \nheparin drip to apixaban given difficulty in achieving \ntherapeutic INR on warfarin. Of note, apixaban has not been \nstudied in patients weighing greater than 120 kg. However, \napixaban is not lipophilic and therefore pharmacologically \nshould not differ in patients with obesity. Did not fail \nwarfarin as was never therapeutic on this medication. Given \ndifficulty with achieving therapeutic INR despite very high \ndoses, and per discussion with pharmacologist, felt that safest \noption was for apixaban. \n\n#AFib\nPer records, appears to have been diagnosed by his PCP in \n___ several years back. However, patient was not started on \nanticoagulation at that time. Was recently started on warfarin 2 \nweeks ago by new PCP who saw him for a preop evaluation for \ncataract surgery. Will continue on apixaban as above \nindefinitely for a chads vasc score of 3. Continue rate control \nwith labetalol.\n\n#LLE Cellulitis\nPresented with LLE erythema and warmth which is on the shin, not \nso much the calf. Patient without fevers, leukocytosis, signs of \nskin breakdown. No concern for joint involvement. Will complete \n5 day course of cephalexin for presumed cellulitis. \n\n#___\n#CAD s\/p PCI with two stents placed\nNo history of CHF per patient.

Due to your difficulty achieving a therapeutic INR on warfarin, we decided to switch you to a different blood thinner called apixaban. Please continue to take the apixaban as directed on the apixaban dose pack you are prescribed. You will need to complete a 5-day course of antibiotics to treat your infection of your left leg."}

Patient was notably orthostatic \n(160s\/80s supine to 85\/palp standing) on presentation on the \nfloor with no signs of hypovolemia on physical exam. Treatment \nwith fludricortisone was considered, but due to concern about \nlower extremity edema (which has been severe in the past), she \nwas started on midodrine 5mg PO QAM in discussion with Dr. \n___, her outpatient neurologist. Though her \nsymptoms improved somewhat, she still was significant \northostatic, so the midodrine was titrated up to 7.5 mg q4-6h \nduring the day. Her metoprolol tartrate 75mg PO QHS was \ncontinued and captopril 12.5mg PO QHS was started on this \nadmission. All antihypertensives were held during the day. The \nhead of the patient's head was elevated ___ degrees at night \nto help with supine hypertension. Her symptoms and orthostatics \nwere monitored throughout her hospital course, and she was \ndischarged with the addition of midodrine and captopril.\n.\n# Pain control: Patient complained of back pain ___ L1 vertebral \nfracture and leg pain ___ peripheral neuropathy. Gabapentin was \ndiscontinued on the day of admission by outpatient neurologist \ndue to concerns about edema and decreased kidney function. She \nwas put on a fentanyl patch and duloxetine on ___, however she \ndeveloped intense leg pains that were refractory to treatment \nwith oxycodone and tramadol. The fentanyl patch was \ndiscontinued, and gabapentin 300mg PO BID was restarted after \nconsulting with her neurologist. The patient was discharged on \ngabapentin and duloxetine for pain control.  She will need close \nfollow up with Dr. ___ neurology to see if these \nmedications are adequately controlling her pain and if \ngabapentin needs to be weaned again in the future.\n.\nINACTIVE ISSUES:\n.\n# Anemia ___ CKD: Patient has had a downtrending Hct (41 in \n___., 37 in ___., 32 now) likely secondary to CKD. Labs show a \nnormocytic anemia with no markers of hemolysis. Low retic of 1.1 \nsuggests underproduction. Iron studies were WNL.

In this particular case, you DO NOT have a urinary tract infection. The pain in your groin is due to a fungal infection on your penis and probably also due to irritation of having a foley catheter in place all the time. Your foley was checked and there was no blockage or blood clots. You should continue with your bi-weekly foley catheter changes. Solutions ot this problem include treatment of the infection for which an antifungal powder is being prescribed. It is VERY important that you keep your groin as clean and dry as possible to treat the infection. A suprapubic catheter, as suggested by your urologist may also improve your comfort. You should discuss this with your urologist regarding details of the procedure and whether or not it may be reversible."}

Unchanged \nfrom ___ ECG.\n\nRADIOLOGY:\n1. THREE VIEWS OF THE LEFT SHOULDER: There is a mildly displaced \ncomminuted fracture of the surgical neck of the left humerus. No \ndislocation is seen. Also noted is severe narrowing of the \nglenohumeral joint with subchondral sclerosis and osteophytic \nformation, as well as moderate narrowing of the \nacromioclavicular joint. The visible lungs are clear. \nIMPRESSION: Comminuted, mildly displaced fracture of the \nsurgical neck of the left humerus. Severe osteoarthritis of the \nleft glenohumeral joint and moderate osteoarthritis of the left \nacromioclavicular joint. \n\n2. REPEAT TWO VIEWS OF THE LEFT HUMERUS AND TWO VIEWS OF THE \nLEFT ELBOW:   \nAgain noted is a mildly displaced comminuted fracture of the \nsurgical neck of the left humerus. No fractures or joint space \nabnormalities are noted at the left elbow although the lateral \nview is limited due to patient positioning. Calcifications are \nnoted adjacent to the olecranon process at the triceps \ninsertion, suggestive of calcific tendinopathy. IMPRESSION:  \n1. Mildly displaced comminuted fracture of the surgical head of \nthe left \nhumerus. These findings, including the change from the wet read \n(that had indicated a non-displaced radial head fracture) were \ncommunicated to the referring physician ___ at 4 pm on \n___. \n\n3. SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE PELVIS: There is moderate \ndegenerative change of the lower lumbar spine as well as \nmoderate narrowing of both hip joints. No fracture or \ndislocation is noted. Vascular calcifications are seen. \nIMPRESSION: Moderate degenerative change of both hip joints and \nthe lower lumbar spine. No fracture or dislocation. \n\n4. CT HEAD: There is no evidence of hemorrhage, edema, mass, \nmass effect, or infarction. The ventricles and and sulci are \nmoderately prominent, unchanged since the ___ \nexamination, reflective of diffuse cortical atrophy. There is \npersistent hypoattenuation of the periventricular white matter, \ncompatible with chronic microvascular ischemic disease. No \nfracture is seen. Moderate atherosclerotic calcifications of the \nimaged portion of the ICAs are seen bilaterally. A tiny mucus \nretention cyst is present within the left maxillary sinus. The \nremaining paranasal sinuses, mastoid air cells, middle ear \ncavities are clear. IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process. \n\n5. CT CHEST: The thyroid gland appears normal. Scattered \naxillary and mediastinal lymph nodes do not meet CT criteria for \nlymphadenopathy. Heart size is top normal. There is no \npericardial effusion. Mild-to-moderate atherosclerotic \ncalcifications are seen within the coronary arteries and the \nthoracic aorta. The great vessels are normal in caliber. There \nis mild dependent atelectasis bilaterally. There are no nodules \nor \nmasses detected. No pneumothorax is present. Diffuse osteopenia \nis seen. An impacted acute fracture of the left humeral neck \n(3:8, 1:2, 401:26) is better seen on the radiographic \nexamination performed on the same day. Severe osteoarthritic \nchanges including complete loss of the glenohumeral joint space, \nis also present. No acute fracture or traumatic malalignment of \nthe thoracic spine is present. There is a transverse lucency and \nminimal displacement of the lower sternum (400B:34) between the \ncostochondral joints of T4-T5 anteriorly, which appears chronic, \n\nas there is no neighboring hematoma present, and after comparing \nto the \nlateral chest radiograph of ___, where a displacement is \nalso seen at the same level. Though not dedicated towards its \nassessment, included views of the upper abdomen demonstrate a \nnormal-appearing liver, spleen, gallbladder, adrenal glands, and \nstomach. There is diffuse fatty atrophy of the pancreas, which \ncontains multiple punctate and coarse calcifications (2:55), \nlikely reflecting the sequela of prior pancreatitis. IMPRESSION: \n1. Impacted left humeral neck fracture, also seen on the prior \nradiographic examination performed on the same day. Chronicity \nis uncertain but appears acute to subacute; correlate with \npresenting symptoms. 2. No rib fractures or pulmonary contusion. \n3. Mild displacement at the inferior portion of the sternum \nappears chronic as noted. Correlate with any tenderness within \nthis region (400B:31) to rule \nout any superimposed acute process. \n\n6. CT NECK: There is no acute fracture or traumatic malalignment \nof the \ncervical spine. No prevertebral soft tissue abnormalities are \ndetected.  \nSevere multilevel degenerative changes are seen, including grade \n1 \nanterolisthesis of C4 on C5 and C5 on C6, disc space narrowing, \nendplate \nsclerosis and cystic changes, and anterior and posterior \nosteophytosis.  \nMild-to-moderate spinal canal narrowing is redemonstrated, worst \nat C3\/4.  \nOverall, the examination appears stable since the ___ \nexamination. The thyroid appears normal. Included views of the \nlung apices are clear. IMPRESSION: 1. No acute fracture or \ntraumatic malalignment of the cervical spine. 2. Grade 1 \nanterolisthesis of C3 on C4, and C4 on C5, with overall \nmoderate-to-severe degenerative changes throughout the cervical \nspine, \nunchanged in appearance since ___. There is \nmild-to-moderate spinal \ncanal narrowing. If there is a high clinical concern for cord \ninjury, MRI can be considered as a more sensitive test. NOTE \nADDED AT ATTENDING REVIEW: There are bilateral fractures at C2. \nOn the right this involves the lamina and extends into the \ninferior facet. On the left there is an isolated fracture of the \nC2 inferior facet, with no involvement of the lamina. These \nfractures are new since the ___, but the fracture lines \ndo not appear as clear as would be expected for acute lesions. \nOverall, these appear to be more likely subacute fractures. \nHowever, \nthis does not address the question of mechanical stability. This \nshould be \nreferred to Spine Surgery. An MR might be helpful to evaluate \nfor possible \nligamentous injury.\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nImpression: No clear etiology for his recurrent falls though no \nsuggestion of a new disease process on his initial evaluation; I \ndo not think his anemia is contributing. Will continue \nconservative management for injuries from fall and plan for \nfurther outpatient evaluation.\n\nMildly displaced fracture of the surgical neck of the humerus: \nSeen by orthopedics in the ER, put in sling and needs to follow \nup with ortho in 1 week for re-evaluation. Will need outpatient \nconsideration of bone density evaluation; he also had a low \ntestosterone level many years ago and this may need to be \nrepeated as an outpatient.  tylenol and tramadol were used for \npain control, pain was adequately controlled with this regimen.  \nSeen by physical therapy who recommended home with ___ as well as \n___ and his home 24 hour care.\n\nNon-displaced C2 fracture: neurosurgery consulted in the ER.  He \nwas placed in a ___ J collar and must remain in this at all \ntimes for the next 6 weeks.  At that time he will f\/u with \nneurosurgery and have a repeat CT of his C spine.  The fracture \nwas age indeterminate but likely from the fall at the end of \n___.\n\nNormocytic anemia: baseline hct is in the mid ___, drop to 29 \nand stable at this level, guaiac negative brown stool and no \nabdominal complaints, but given NSAID use an upper GI slow bleed \nsource is possible.  He was started on a higher dose of a PPI \n(omeprazole 20mg po daily, increased to 40mg po bid) for an \nempiric 6 week course.\n \nMedications on Admission:\n-Patient unsure of his medications and doses; list below is from \nOMR-\nClonazepam 0.5 mg by mouth twice a day\nFinasteride 5 mg at night   \nOmeprazole 20 mg daily   \nDoxazosin 4 mg at night   \nZoloft 50 mg daily   \nNaproxen Sodium 275 mg tablets. ___ tablets twice daily as \nneeded neck and arthritis pain\nEstazolam (ProSom) ___ mg as needed for insomnia\nFluticasone 50 mcg\/Actuation Nasal Spray, 2 sprays in each \nnostril once a day\nMiralax once daily\n \nDischarge Medications:\n1.

She was in serious \ncondition for much of her hospitalization, but she never \ndecompensated into septic shock.  Her hospital course was \nnotable for recurrent sinus tachycardia and fevers to 103, \nmanagement of neutrophil-predominant pleural effusions s\/p \nthoracenteses\/chest tubes, brief MICU transfer for somnolence, \nand brief MICU transfer for hypoxia.  She improved slowly on \nVancomycin IV.  When her chest tubes had been removed, and she \nwas breathing comfortably on room air, and she became afebrile \nfor >24H, she was discharged to rehab to complete her antibiotic \ncourse.\n\n#. MRSA Sepsis: endocarditis with lung abscesses.\nFever to 103 with rigors, sinus tachycardia to 140, leukocytosis \nto 21K, and tachypnea all represented systemic response to her \ninfection.  She grew MRSA from BCx at the OSH, but here the only \n(+) was the very first blood culture - all subsequent cultures \nwere negative.  Though she had no murmur on exam, with MRSA \nbacteremia and continued fevers, clinically fits with \nendocarditis.  Most likely right-sided IE given that patient is \nIVDU, as well as the fact that she has lung emboli and no \nobvious left-sided peripheral emboli (head CT negative, MRI \nspine negative for abscess, CT abdomen negative for splenic \nabscess).  ___ TTE's did suggest a ?right-sided vegetation but \nthis was not seen on subsequent TTE or TEE.  She continued to \nspike high fevers with infectious w\/u negative for another \ncause, and these continued fevers were likely due to septic lung \nabscesses.  Effusions were managed with drainage (see below).  \nShe was followed closely by ID who recommended continuing \nVancomycin, though she was changed to Daptomycin prior to \ndischarge due to rash (see below).  Over time, she exhibited \nless septic physiology, and she became more comfortable.  Her \nleukocytosis resolved completely (WBC 5.4 on discharge).  She \nstarted to ambulate, breathing comfortably and was weaned to \nroom air.  She stopped spiking fevers (last fever was 102.9 at \n2400 on ___, >2 days before discharge).  At this point, she was \ndischarged to rehab to complete her treatment course; proposed \nend-day is ___ which will complete a 6-week course.  She \nshould have weekly CBC, CHEM7, LFTs, and CPK faxed to ATTN: \n___ OPAT RNs at fax# ___.  She will follow-up in ___ \nclinic in 2.5 weeks (scheduled).  \n\n#. Pleural effusions: neutrophil-predominant parapneumonic \neffusions, not empyema, slowly resolving.\nInterventional Pulmonary was following.  She underwent the \nfollowing procedures:\n___ right thoracentesis\n___ left chest tube insertion (removed)\n___ left chest tube insertion (removed ___ right thoracentesis\nThe fluid was not consistent with empyema and likely represents \ninflammation due to her infection.  No growth from pleural fluid \nculture.  Based on imaging, the pleural effusion size has \ndecreased.  In the future, if effusions do not resolve, she \nmight require further procedures including possible pleurodesis. \n She requires repeat CT chest in ~1 month to ensure that the \neffusions have resolved (scheduled); she also has follow-up \nscheduled at ___ Interventional Pulmonary clinic. \n\n#. Rash: likely from Vancomycin.\nOn the evening of ___ she was noted to have a mild thigh rash \nbut by the next day she had erupted into a maculopapular \nblanching rash on her thighs, upper chest, back, and lower \nabdomen (arms were spared).  Also had a follicular-pattern rash \non her legs.  No fever or leukocytosis.  Only mildly pruritic.  \nNo mucosal involvement.  It was felt that this likely \nrepresented a reaction to Vancomycin (even though it was started \nweeks prior).  Per I.D. recommendations, she was changed to \nDaptomycin, which she tolerated without complication.  \n\n#. Somnolence requiring MICU transfer: resolved, likely a \nmedication effect.\nPatient was transferred to the ICU ___ due to being found \nvery lethargic.  Review of her medications revealed several \nnarcoticts and benzodiazepines that were suggestive of \niatrogenic somnolence.  Opiods and benzodiazepines were held, \nwith return of patient's baseline mental status.  Pain consult \nwas performed who suggested no further IV pain medications, with \nuse of Oxycodone instead.  She did not require Narcan and had no \nfurther episodes of somnolence.\n\n#. Hypoxia requiring MICU transfer: resolved, likely from lung \nabscesses, effusions, fever.\nPatient was transferred to the ICU ___ due to hypoxia (POx \nin the ___ on 4L NC).  Was likely related to her underlying \nlung infection and large effusions.  She underwent chest tube \nplacement with some resolution.  Also, she might have had \ndesaturation during fevers due to vasodilation and loss of \nhypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction leading to shunt physiology.  \nShe never required ventilatory assistance; she improved and was \non 4L NC for much of her admission.  By the time of discharge, \nshe was weaned to room air but was intermittently using O2 for \ncomfort.\n\n#. Pain control: complicated by her h\/o IV heroin use and \naddiction.\nChronic Pain Service agreed that she is not a candidate for long \nterm opioid therapy, but she did require some IV Dilaudid in the \nsetting of chest tube placements and other procedures.  By the \ntime of discharge, she was weaned to Oxycodone ___ PO Q4H \nPRN, and further down-titration and eventual cessation of \nnarcotic pain meds would be appropriate while she is at rehab.  \nShe also continues on Tylenol, Lidocaine patch, and Gabapentin \nfor pain control.  Had some mild dyspepsia with NSAIDs but these \ncould certainly be used as well.  She would benefit from \nfollow-up with an addiction specialist.\n\n# Anemia: unclear etiology, resolved.\nHct was 29.6 on admission, had a nadir of 20.8 on ___, and was \n29.6 on discharge.  hemolysis\/DIC workup negative and she was \nguaiac negative.  Likely from decreased RBC production and \npossibly from bleeding due to procedures.  She received a total \nof 6u pRBCs this admission.  Hct was stable at the time of \ndischarge and she had no signs of bleeding.\n\n#. Leg swelling: resolving.\nShe had symmetric leg edema and right ankle swelling, likely \nfrom requiring large volumes of IV fluids.  TTE showed good pump \nfunction.  LENIs were negative and ankle film showed no \nfracture.  With mobility and ambulation, the edema is resolving \n(currently trace edema upon discharge).\n\n#. Psych: initial presentation with SI, but no SI this \nadmission. \nShe was closely followed by Social Work this admission.  She has \nexpressed an interest in working on her mental health, mostly \nbecause she wishes to stay healthy for her son.  She never had \nany SI or HI while hospitalized here.  She should have follow-up \nwith mental health providers after discharge.  She continues on \nClonazepam.\n\n#. h\/o IV heroine use and cocaine use: patient wishes to stay \ndrug-free.\nShe was tested for HIV, HCV, and HBV which were negative.  As \nmentioned above, she was followed closely by Social Work.  She \ndid describe herself as a \"heroin addict\" and hopes to be able \nto stay drug-free after discharge.  She had no signs\/symptoms of \nwithdrawal this admission, but was treated with Clonidine \ninitially (not continued upon discharge).  She should have \nfollow-up with mental health providers after discharge.  \n\n#. ?ADHD: was a pre-admission diagnosis.\nShe is prescribed Adderall extended release 30mg PO QAM and \nAdderall 30mg BID as an outpatient (confirmed with her \npharmacy).  Unclear indication.  She requested to be restarted \non Adderall and she was put on Adderall 10mg daily.  She should \nbe encouraged to wean off amphetamine-based medication given her \ncocaine\/heroin history.\n\n#. Transitional Issues\n-Code status: Full Code \n-Emergency Contact: mother ___ ___\n-Access: PICC line placed ___\n-***Please remove PICC line after antibiotic course is \ncomplete.***\n-Pain control: By the time of discharge, she was weaned to \nOxycodone ___ PO Q4H PRN, and further down-titration and \neventual cessation of narcotic pain meds would be appropriate \nwhile she is at rehab, especially since her chest tubes were \nremoved days ago.\n-Fever: Last fever was 102.9 at 2400 on ___, >2 days before \ndischarge.  If at rehab she spikes a fever >101, this would be \nan indication for repeat blood cultures, UA\/urine culture, and \nchest x-ray.  If no source is found and fever persists, she \nshould return to ___ for workup which could include chest CT \nand possible tagged WBC scan.\n-Rash (presumably from Vancomycin): She has a maculopapular \nblanching rash on her thighs, upper chest, back, and lower \nabdomen (arms\/palms spared, no mucosal involvement).

Complex fatty mass in the right upper back is concerning for \na low-grade liposarcoma. Further evaluation as an outpatient \nwith MRI is recommended. \n6. Chronic left pleural effusion and atelectasis with evidence \nof chronic bronchitis. \n7. Stable chronic right shoulder joint effusion. \n\n___ MRI C-Spine\n1. Incomplete exam with sagittal images only. The obtained \nsagittal images are \nlimited by motion artifacts. \n2. Compared to ___, there is increased collapse of \nC4 and C5 \nvertebral bodies and persistent kyphotic angulation at C4-5. \nPreexisting \nirregularity within the C4-5 endplates could be related to prior \ninfection or, \nless likely, rheumatoid arthritis. Currently, there is edema in \nthe C4-5 disk \nspace, likely posttraumatic, given the presence of prevertebral \nedema and \ndisruption of the anterior and posterior longitudinal ligaments. \nThe spinal \ncanal at C4-5 is moderately narrowed with abutment of the spinal \ncord, but no \nclear evidence for cord edema on limited assessment. \n3. Nondisplaced fracture through the posterior superior corner \nof the C7 \nvertebral body demonstrates only mild bone marrow edema, \nsuggesting that the \nfracture may not be acute. T7 spinous process fracture \ndemonstrates corticated \nmargins on CT, suggesting that it is not acute, but there is \nassociated soft \ntissue edema. \n4. Apparent interspinous and left paravertebral edema at C2-3 \nmay be \nposttraumatic. CT demonstrates progressive erosive changes in \nthe \ncontralateral right C2-3 facet joint, with associated high T2 \nsignal on the \npresent MRI, which may be related to rheumatoid arthritis or \ninfection. \n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n# S\/p fall, concern for fracture of transverse process of C4 \nvertebral body: patient was evaluated in the ED by ortho spine \nat which point there was no indication for surgical \nintervention. MRI did not show evidence of cord compression. \nOrtho Spine reviewed films and thought fractures were chronic. \nC-collar was subsequently removed. There was question of a \nthoracic trachea protrusion on OSH read of CT scan which was \nreviewed by ___ thoracic CT radiology, and felt to be narrow \nAP diameter and no evidence of any endotracheal mass.  He \nunderwent swallow and video swallow eval and deemed safe for \nground solids and thin liquids under supervision.\n\n# HCAP: CXR revealed a RLL infiltrate concerning for HCAP. In \nlight of negative urine culture, hypoxia (2L NC O2 requirement) \nand fever, patient was treated with PO levoquin and will \ncomplete a 7 day course. \n\n# Urinary tract infection: febrile to 104 initially with a \ngrossly positive UA.  Urine Cx was negative, however the patient \nreceived a dose of ceftriaxone prior to obtaining the culture. \nCompleting treatment with levofloxacin. \n\n# Altered mental status: patient has baseline dementia, however \nmental status is acutely changed. Most likely delirium in the \nsetting of urinary tract infection. LFTs, electrolytes, renal \nfunction and glucose are stable. CT head at OSH was w\/o evidence \nof acute process. Improved but fluctuated throughout course.\n\n# Atrial fibrillation with RVR: patient with known afib, \ncurrently on metoprolol PO at home. Not on anticoagulation given \nrisk for hemorrhage. Patient had multiple episodes of RVR the \nfirst night of admission when he was not on home metoprolol. \nEpisodes occured in the setting of agitation and fever. Patient \nwas rate controlled with home dose metoprolol in-house and had \nno further episodes of RVR.\n\n# Hypoxemia: patient has a new O2 requirement and required 2L O2 \nat discharge without respiratory distress.  Patient underwent \nbilateral LENIs which did not reveal DVT. CTA was not performed \ndue to low-risk for PE. On discharge patient's O2 requirement \nwas 2L NC.  He is discharged with home O2 and would recommend \nevaluation for resolution of new O2 requirement in setting of \npneumonia. Recommend weaning O2 as tolerated, and ___ CXR in 4 \nweeks.  He was noted to have desaturations during sleep, raising \nsuuspicion for OSA.  Would recommend polysomnogram and patient \nmay cont to req O2 when sleeping. \n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\n-Continue Levofloxacin for 7-day course through ___. \n-Home O2 set up; evaluate for resolution of new O2 requirement \nin setting of pneumonia.

She \nwas ruled out for MI. Chest CT demonstrated little to cause \nthese symptoms. Gastroenterology was consulted and performed an \nEGD that showed duodenitis. This is likely the cause of her \nsymptoms. A recurrencence of malignancy was not appreciated in \nthe EGD. Her symptoms resolved during the hospitalization. She \nwill be continued on high dose PPI BID and follow up with her \nPCP for further management. Biopsies of the gastrum were \nperformed and were pending at time of discharge. H. pylori \nantibody testing was performed and the test at time of discharge \nwas pending. Upon completion of this summary, the test returned \nas positive.

Ultrasound was performed which showed \nno lesions that could address this. A repeat test should be \nconsidered in the outpatient setting.\n\n# Lung Nodule: CT of chest showed significant interval \nenlargement of the right upper lobe nodule highly suspicious for \nlung cancer until proven otherwise. This worrisome finding is to \nbe followed up in the outpatient. \n\n# Pharyngeal Polyps: Noted in EGD. Patient asymptomatic and is \nscheduled to follow up with ENT for further evaluation\/removal \nin the outpatient setting. \n\n# Atypical Kidney Findings on CT: A heterogenous right kidney \nwas reported on CT.

Extensive confluent and multifocal infarcts involving the \ninferomedial \naspect of both cerebellar hemispheres, with signal \ncharacteristics suggesting that these are \"late-acute\" or \n\"early-subacute\" and correspond to the infarcts demonstrated on \nthe ___ study, performed one day earlier. \n2. No associated hemorrhage, herniation or evidence of \nobstructive \nhydrocephalus. \n3. Abnormalities involving the vertebral arteries, bilaterally, \nwith possible origin stenosis on the right and distal \nocclusion\/thrombosis on the left; given the clinical context, \nthe latter, ___ particular, could reflect impacted embolic \nmaterial from a more proximal source. \n4. The 2D-TOF and the cranial portion of the enhanced cervical \nMRA both \nsuggest very poor flow ___ the distal left vertebral artery, as \nwell as \nthroughout the basilar artery and its branches, including the \nsuperior \ncerebellar vessels, bilaterally, which may relate to the embolic \nevent, above. There is no finding on these sequences to \nspecifically suggest vertebral arterial dissection, which, ___ \n___, would not account for the bilaterality of the \ncerebellar hemispheric findings. \n5. Relatively mild atherosclerotic disease involving, \nparticularly, the left common and internal carotid arteries, \nwith no flow-limiting stenosis. There is no flow-limiting \nstenosis ___ the intracranial anterior circulation. \n6. Focal cystic encephalomalacia and surrounding gliosis \ninvolving the left frontovertex, likely related to previous \nembolic infarct. \n.\nChest X-ray (___):\nIMPRESSION: AP chest reviewed ___ the absence of prior chest \nradiographs: \nET tube is ___ standard placement. Left PIC line tip projects \nover the \nanticipated location of the mid SVC. Mediastinum and left \nhemithorax are very abnormal suggesting extensive mediastinal \nadenopathy and pleural abnormality perhaps lingular collapse. \nOverall the findings are strongly suggestive of extensive \nmalignancy. Alternatively there could be widespread hemorrhage \n___ both mediastinum and left pleural space. Right lung clear. No \npneumothorax. \n.\nCT Torso (___):\nIMPRESSION: \n1. ET tube approximately 7 cm above the carina.  \n2. Left thyroid lobe nodule. Clinical correlation is \nrecommended. \n3. Small bilateral pleural effusions and lower lobe \nconsolidation versus \natelectasis. Aspiration can have a similar appearance. \n4. Mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes measuring up to 1 cm ___ \nshort-axis \ndiameter. These may be reactive but are nonspecific.   \n5. Coronary artery calcifications and vascular calcifications. \n6. Trace pericardial effusion. \n.\nChest x-ray (___):\nSevere cardiomegaly is stable. Widened mediastinum mainly due to \nincrease ___ the mediastinal fat as seen ___ prior CT from ___ is unchanged. ET tube remains at the level of the thoracic \ninlet. Right IJ catheter tip is ___ the upper SVC. Left \nretrocardiac opacities have improved consistent with improving \npreviously large areas of atelectasis. There is no pneumothorax \nor large pleural effusions. \n.\nChest X-ray (___):\nINDICATION: Lymphadenopathy. \nFINDINGS: Endotracheal tube terminates above the thoracic inlet \nlevel and \ncould be advanced several centimeters for standard positioning.  \n\nCardiomediastinal contours remain widened. Based upon review of \nrecent CT \ntorso, this appears to be due to extensive mediastinal \nlipomatosis. Mild \nvolume overload is present. Dense left retrocardiac opacity has \ndeveloped, \nlikely a combination of atelectasis and effusion. \n.\nTransthoracic Echo (___):\nThe left atrium is dilated. The right atrium is moderately \ndilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. \nThe left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. Due to \nsuboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality \ncannot be fully excluded. LV systolic function appears \ndepressed. The right ventricular cavity is dilated with \ndepressed free wall contractility. The aortic valve leaflets are \nmildly thickened (?#). The aortic valve is not well seen. There \nis no aortic valve stenosis. Significant aortic regurgitation is \npresent, but cannot be quantified. The mitral valve leaflets are \nmildly thickened. Mitral regurgitation is present but cannot be \nquantified. There is a trivial\/physiologic pericardial effusion. \n\n.\nIMPRESSION: poor technical quality due to patient's body \nhabitus. Both ventricles are dilated and hypokinetic however \nexact function and size cannot be determined. Mitral and aortic \nregurgitation, unable to quantify. Pulmonary artery systolic \npressure could not be determined. Unable to assess if LV \nthrombus. \n.\nEEG (___):\nIMPRESSION: This is a mildly abnormal extended routine EEG ___ \nthe \nwaking state. There is occasional theta and delta frequency \nslowing ___ \nthe right temporal regions and, to a lesser degree, there was \nalso mild \nleft temporal slowing consisting of theta frequencies. The \ncardiac \nrhythm was irregularly irregular with frequent PVCs. There were \nno \nepileptiform features on this study. \n.\n\nCT head ___:\n\nFINDINGS: There is no intracranial hemorrhage. Multifocal \nhypodensities \nwithin the pons and the cerebellum are consistent with the prior \ninfarcts, and \nare better assessed on previous MRI. Left frontal area of cystic \n\nencephalomalacia is unchanged. Otherwise, current gray-white \nmatter \ndifferentiation of the hemispheres is maintained. The ventricles \nare \nunchanged ___ size and configuration. There is no uncal or \ntranstentorial \nherniation. There are no fractures. There is opacification of \nscattered \nethmoid air cells and mucosal thickening of the sphenoid sinus \nand maxillary \nsinuses. The mastoid air cells are under pneumatized and \nopacified. \n  \nIMPRESSION: \n  \n1. No intracranial hemorrhage. \n  \n2. Evolving pontine and cerebellar infarcts. \n  \n3.

He \nwas admitted to the stroke service ___ the ICU from ___ to \n___.\n.\nNEURO\nFollowing his arrival to the ___, an MRI and angiography of \nthe head and neck was performed to better characterize the \nlesions.  The studies demonstrated extensive confluent and \nmultifocal infarcts involving the pons and inferomedial aspect \nof both cerebellar hemispheres.  The strokes appreared ___ the \ncontext of abnormalities ___ the vertebral arteries (possible \norigin stenosis on the right and distal occlusion\/thrombosis on \nthe left) with poor flow ___ the basilar artery and its branches, \nincluding the superior cerebellar vessels. There was no \nassociated hemorrhage, herniation or evidence of obstructive \nhydrocephalus. The heparin drip initiated at ___ was \ncontinued with an initial PTT goal of 60-80 and subsequent goal \nof 50-70.  Following the placement of a PEG, coumadin was \nstarted with a target INR of two to three.\n.\nThe patient's neurological examination remained relatively \nconstant.  He appeared alert and interactive.  He could follow \nbasic midline and appendicular requests (eg \"stick out your \ntongue\" and \"lift your right arm).  There was evidence of \ngaze-evoked nystagmus.  He could voluntarily shake is head \"yes\" \nand \"no\" ___ addition to moving the distal aspect of his left \nupper extremity and left toes.  Occasionally clonus was noted ___ \nthe left upper extremity.  A bilateral extensor response was \nobserved.\n.\n___\nThe patient was monitored by telemetry, which demonstrated \nchronic atrial fibrillation.  Metoprolol was given for rate \ncontrol and cardioprotection.  However, minimal doses of the \nbeta-blocker were used ___ an attempt to allow a target systolic \nblood pressure of 120 to 140.  A statin was continued.  Per the \npatient's cardiologist (and PCP), aspirin and plavix were not \nnecessary for prophylaxis for his cardiac stents, and thus, \nthese meds were not started. \n.\nAs the appearance of the vessel occlusions and infarcts were \nsuggestive of embolic phenomena from a proximal source, a \ntransthoracic echocardiogram was performed.  Due to the \ntechnical challenges of the study, the presence of an LV \nthrombus could not be explored.  There is no comment regarding \nthe presence of ASD, PFO and vegetations.  Note was made of the \nirregularly irregular rhythm.  As noted above, following the \nplacement of the PEG, coumadin was started for the atrial \nfibrillation, INR goal of ___.  PTT goal while bridging is \n50-70.\n.\nRESP\nUpon arrival Mr. ___ had an endotracheal tube placed.  To \nprotect the airway, the ETT was transitioned to trach (___) \n___ the course of the hospitalization.  He required MMV \nrespiratory support due to having been noted to have episodes of \napnea while on trach-mask.  These occured o\/n only and were of \n___ - 2 min duration\n.  Repeat HCT on ___ was performed to evaluate for pontine \nhemorrhage possibly affecting the respiratory centers.  This was \nnegative.  It was felt that etiology was most likely due to \npontine infarction.  Will need further monitoring and weaning as \ntolerated if apneic episodes do not recur.\n\nID\n___ the course of the hospitalization, the patient developed \npersistent fevers.  The peak wbc count was 21.8 (___).  The \nbronchealveolar lavage revealed commensal respiratory flora.  \nUrine cultures were repeatedly negative.  One of six blood \ncultures (___) grew coagulase negative staph, and the \nresult was thought to reflect contamination.  Two MRSA screens \nwere negative.  Two sputum cultures were negative, and gram \nstains were considered contaminated by upper respiratory \nsecretions. Two of three catheter tip cultures were negative. \n___ IV tip catheter culture grew VRE.  No blood cultures were \npositive.  Vancomycin was discontinued and he was started on \nLinezolid for a seven day course, Day 1 = ___ with last day of \n___.\n.\nAlthough daily chest x-rays failed to reveal clear evidence of \nthe condition, treatment with ciprofloxacin, cefuroxime, and \nvancomycin was initiated to treat presumed ventilator-associated \npneumonia.  He completed 7 day course of ciprofloxacin and \ncerfuroxime and vancomycin on ___.\n.\nHEME\/ONC\nThere was some concern that the patient could be hypercoaguable. \n Analyses for Factor V Leiden and the Prothrombin Gene Mutation \nwere negative.  It might be worth conducting a more thorough \nstudy (eg protein C, protein S, anticardiolipin Ab, etc)for \npotential coagulopathy ___ the non-acute setting.\n.\nBecause the initial chest x-ray was thought to show findings \nconcerning for malignancy, a CT Torso was done.  The study \nshowed non-specific, possibly reactive,  mediastinal and hilar \nlymph nodes measuring up to 1 cm ___ short-axis \ndiameter.  There were also small bilateral pleural effusions and \nlower lobe consolidation versus atelectasis.  No further \ninvestigatory studies were pursued.\n.\nABD\/GI\nUltimately, on ___, a PEG was placed by the Interventional \nRadiology Service to provide nutrition.  Tube feeds were \nadministered.\n.\nENDO:\nInsulin was administered by sliding scale with a goal of \nmaintaining normoglycemia.\n.\nRENAL:\nPrior to discharge, the lasix was restarted for diastolic \ndysfunction intermittently, however, was eventually discontinued \ndue to no oxygen requirement.\n.\nREHABILITATION:\nThe physical and occupational therapy teams participated ___ the \npatient's care\n.\nCODE\nFull\n.\nHCP\n___ ___\n \nMedications on Admission:\nMedications on Admission:\ncoumadin 10mg QD\nsimvastatin 80mg QD\nPlavix 75mg QD \nLasix 40mg QD\ndoxazosin 1mg QD\nnitroglycerin prn chest pain\n.\nAllergies:\nNKDA\n\n \nDischarge Medications:\n1.

Unfortunately no known \nculture data was available but a negative MRSA swab was obtained \n\nin ___. Had prominent concerning features in history for \naspiration, given hx of CVA. No hx of immunosuppression. In the \nemergency room chest x-ray demonstrated evidence of a left lower \n\nlobe question of atelectasis versus consolidation, deemed to be \nconcerning for possible healthcare community-acquired pneumonia. \n\nStrep pneumo and legionella were negative. Blood cultures \ndemonstrated one sample with GPCs in cluster, coagulase \nnegative, deemed to be a likely contaminant. There was very low \nsuspicion for endocarditis, hence a TTE was not performed during \n\nthis admission. patient was treated with abx coverage initially \nwith vancomycin, ceftazidime, Flagyl, thereafter transitioned to \n\nlevofloxacin once GPCs in culture returned as \ncoagulase-negative. On ___ patient experienced questionable \nevent that was concerning for aspiration, not with any \ndesaturations noted on O2 pulse oximetry, patient remained \nsymptomatically at baseline and no repeat imaging or additional \ntreatment was provided. Patient was treated symptomatically with \n\nDuoNeb's as per her standing orders for nursing home. There were \n\nseveral blood cultures pending at the time of discharge. She \nwill continue an abx course with levofloxacin to complete 7 days \n\nworth of treatment (D1 = ___, D7 = ___.\n\n# Abnormal electrocardiogram (R94.31) \n# Prolonged QT syndrome\nPatient presented with new ECG findings including T wave \ninversions in leads V3-V6, and prolonged QT interval, compared \nwith baseline in ___. It was difficult to assess patient \nsymptoms. Patient received serial troponins x 3, which were \nnegative. QTc prolonging medications (e.g. nausea, \nantipsychotics) were avoided.\n# Unspecified atrial fibrillation I___ - Patient presented \nwith CHADS-Vasc of 6 (points for age, gender, CVA hx, and HTN) - \n\nStroke risk was deemed to be 9.7% per year in >90,000 patients \n(the ___ Atrial Fibrillation Cohort Study) and 13.6% risk of \n\nstroke\/TIA\/systemic embolism. She did not arrive on \nanticoagulation given family wishes, continued on patient on \nrate\/rhythm control with metoprolol, verapamil (documentation \nprovided by ___ home initially stated diltiazem, though this \n\nwas clarified), presented with evidence of tachycardia. She was \nmonitored on telemetry and not treated with anticoagulation. She \n\nreceived an infectious workup as above to assess for possible \ntriggers for atrial fibrillation.\n\n# s\/p CVA w\/ chronic seizures: patient minimally interactive at \nbaseline. She was kept on fall\/delirium precautions. Keppra was \ncontinued. Recommended regular changes in her position to \nprotect against predisposition to sacral decubitus ulcer.\n\n# HTN\/CAD hx: Patient presenting with evidence of systolic \nblood pressures up to the 190s and 200s, dosing of \nantihypertensives provided on initial documentation from the \nnursing home was clarified. After clarification it became clear \nthat diltiazem was no longer being prescribed, patient was now \non verapamil. This was uptitrated over the course of \nhospitalization, with improved symptomatically controlled. \nPatient was no longer requiring as needed hydralazine at time of \n\ndischarge. No current evidence of hypertensive emergency during \nadmission, though difficult to assess exam ___ minimal \ninteractivity. She was continued on her previous asa, \nfurosemide, verapamil, and lisinopril w\/ holding parameters.\n\nNONACTIVE Issues:\n# left ear bleeding - Per ED report patient had witnessed \nbleeding from the left ear, no known history of coagulopathy, \nnot on atrial fibrillation anticoagulation. On evaluation on the \n\nfloor there was visualized clotted blood within both ears (in \nthe external canal), but no visualized focal bleeding around the \n\nTM on either side. No Battle's sign or other focal indications \nof head trauma. Patient received CT head which was reassuring \nwith regard to possibility of traumatic head bleed. After stable \n\nexam the primary team stopped trending coags as exam was stable.\n\n*Chronic Issues:\n# Pain: Continued standing liquid APAP through G-tube without \nissue. Avoided narcotics given DNR\/DNI and risk of sedation.\n# Nutrition: tube feeds, MVI. Nutrition consulted and \nrecommended liquid MVI, which was not on formulary, and 300 mL \nof free water flushes. Otherwise previous nursing home order was \n\nresumed.\n# Wound myasis B87.1 - continued silver sulfadiazine, Mupirocin \nointment without issue.\n# GERD\/GI upset: continued ranitidine, Simethicone without \nissue.\n\n============================\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\n============================\n- Patient is being discharged on a regimen of levofloxacin for \nHCAP vs. aspiration pneumonia (D1 = ___, D5 = ___. WBC on \ndischarge 8.8.\n- Patient has several blood cultures which are currently \npending.\n- Patient had witnessed questionable aspiration event on ___ \nwith no visible desat or change in functional status, which \ncleared immediately after the event. No repeat imaging was done \nand patient remained symptomatic. Should her breathing worsen \nacutely following discharge, repeat x-ray and evaluation for \naspiration pneunonitis\/pna may be considered.\n- Due to continued hypertensive urgency, patient's dosage of \nverapamil was increased from 40 mg 3 times a day to 80 mg 3 \ntimes a day. This may need further titration after she returns \nto the nursing home. Continued blood pressure monitoring is \nrecommended.\n- FYI: patient had long QTc on EKG performed on ___ in ED. \n507\/564 ms. ___ repeat EKG\/ reevaluate risk for Torsades if \nconsidering anti-emetics \/ antipsychotics and other QTc \nprolonging medications.\n- Thyroid nodule: per ED scan, 2.5 cm heterogeneously enlarged \nright thyroid lobe. If clinically indicated not previously \nassessed consider dedicated thyroid ultrasound for further \nevaluation.\n- Patient had evidence of microscopic hematuria during \nadmission. Please repeat a UA in follow-up.

Patient was started on insulin \ngtt and his anion gap quickly closed with improvement in his \nsymptoms. Suspect DKA secondary to medication noncompliance, as \npt reported that his glucometer was not working, and he was \nworried about hypoglycemia, and perhaps was not taking his \ninsulin as instructed. Course complicated by bradycardia likely \nsecondary to metabolic derangements in the setting of DKA; home \nmetoprolol was stopped. Heart rate improved and appropriately \naugmented with exertion. He was discharged on an increase \ninsulin regimen per ___ recommendations, with close follow \nup with ___. \n\n# DKA:\n# Type 1 DM:\nPatient has a history of DKA but with recent A1c of 7.7-8.0%. \nInitial labs were consistent with DKA (AG metabolic acidosis \nwith pH 7.29, ketonuria, hyperglycemia). Patient was admitted to \nthe ICU and treated with IVF and insulin gtt. Gap closed and \npatient was transitioned to glargine 4 mg bid (home regimen) and \nHISS per ___.  Trigger for DKA was thought to most likely be \ninsulin non-adherence. Infectious work-up was negative. \nTroponins were mildly elevated (peaked at 0.09 though this was \nthought to reflect type 2 demand ischemia rather than ACS. Also \nwith asymptomatic bacteriuria, 10,000-100,000 enterococcus. \nCould be cause of DKA, but have better alternative explanation. \nHis insulin continued to be titrated and he was discharged with \nclose outpatient ___ follow up. Attempted to involve family \nin care of his diabetes for better glycemic control. A1c pending \nat discharge.\n\n# Bradycardia: The patient had several syncopal episodes prior \nto admission. Patient with consistent sinus bradycardia in the \n___, but episodes where heart rates decrease to ___. The patient \nwas asymptomatic during this episodes. EP was consulted, and \nbelieve this was due to metabolic derangements secondary to DKA. \nPatient also exhibited chronotropic response on exertion with \nHRs 70-90s. he was monitored on telemetry, and his bradycardia \nresolved with treatment of DKA. His beta blocker was held on \ndischarge. \n\n# Syncope: \nPatient with multiple episodes of syncope prior to admission, \neach while changing position from sitting to standing and in the \nsetting of nausea and vomiting suggestive of orthostasis. \nConsidered bradycardia as cause of syncope as well. No murmurs \non exam to suggest valvular disease and TTE from ___ without \nvalvular dysfunction. He was orthostatic negative after fluid \nrepletion. He was monitored on tele and had no further episodes \nof syncope. \n\n# ___: Creatinine 1.7 on admission, improved to 1.1 after IVF. \n\n#Hypoxia\nPatient with O2 sats in the 90___s, asymptomatic. CXR revealed \nsmall bilateral pleural effusions and atelectasis likely \nnonspecific in setting of acute illness and reduced activity. \nProvided incentive spirometry.

The pleura appears is smooth but thikc; evaluation \nfor infection\nis limited without contrast.\n2. Complete collapse of the right lower lobe and incomplete \ncollapse of the\nright middle lobe.\n3.

No acute intracranial hemorrhage. No mass effect. Stable \nlarge territory\nchronic infarction MR is more sensitive in the detection of \nacute stroke. MR\nwith gadolinium is more sensitive in the detection of sequelae \nof intracranial\ninfarction.\n2. Small amount of fluid in the right maxillary sinus raises the \npossibility of sinusitis.\n\nCT Head ___ w\/o contrast:\n1. No acute hemorrhage, mass effect, large mass, edema, or acute \ninfarction is noted.  \n2. Stable large region of cystic encephalomalacia and volume \nloss, consistent with remote right MCA territorial infarction. \n3. No pathologic enhancement. \n.\nEEG ___:\nThis is an abnormal portable EEG due to slowing and \ndisorganization of the background rhythm and intermittent focal \nslowing \nin the left frontal and anterior sylvian regions. These findings \n\nsuggest a possible focus of subcortical dysfunction in this area \nand an \nunderlying moderate to severe encephalopathy. Medications, \ntoxic\/metabolic disturbances and infections are common causes. \nThere \nwere no epileptiform discharges or electrographic seizures seen \nin this \nrecording. \n.\nCXR ___:\nAs compared to the previous radiograph, there is now complete \nopacification of the right hemithorax. The absence of \nmediastinal shift to \nthe left suggests a combination of pleural effusion and \natelectasis. The left lung shows unchanged apical thickening and \na just minimal pleural effusion as well as a small retrocardiac \natelectasis. Focal parenchymal opacity suggesting pneumonia are \nnot present. The left-sided central venous access line has been \nremoved in the interval \n.\nCXR ___:\nThe endotracheal tube measures 4.4 cm above the \ncarina. The right pleural effusion and partial collapse of the \nright lung are unchanged since ___. The cardiac \nand mediastinal silhouette is stable. The left lung is well \nexpanded. There is no pneumothorax. The right-sided pacemaker \nand lead is unchanged in position. \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n# Altered Mental Status: The patient was initially brought in to \nbe evaluated for possible confusion per his family. However on \nfurther questioning, he initially appeared to be at his relative \nbaseline (blind, nearly deaf, left hemiplegia, intermittently \nsaying ___ words with signficant stimulation but rarely \noriented). An RPR was found to be mildy positive and \nneurosyphyllis was thought to be possibly contributing to his \nconfusion. To this end a lumbar puncture under fluoroscopic \nguidance was pursued. However, due to decompensation (see below) \nthe LP was not completed. Given the risk of a repeat LP, under \nguidance from the infectious disease department, it was decided \nto treat him for presumed neurosyphyllis. He received 2 weeks of \nIV ceftriaxone, completed in house, with little improvement of \nhis mental status after his arrest. After his arrest, the \npatients mental status became essentially unresponsive to any \nstimuli. Repeat CT head and EEG showed no acute process. The \npatient could not receive an MRI due to a pacemaker. In \nconsultation with neurology, his new baseline may be a result of \nsome anoxic brain injury.\n.\n# PEA arrest: The morning of his lumbar puncture, a CXR showed \ncomplete opacification of his right lung, likely indicating a \nsignificant mucous plug at that time. At baseline, he has a \nlarge, chronic, loculated pleural effusion that compresses most \nof the right lung, leaving only a small section aerated. During \nhis lumbar puncture procedure, the patient suffered a PEA arrest \nand was down for approximately 5 minutes. He was resuscitated \nwith CPR. As above, after the arrest, his mental status was \nessentially unresponsive. His ability to protect his airway was \nsignificantly decreased. After initial extubation after his \narrest, he required frequent nasal trumpet suctioning to prevent \nrecurrent mucous plugging. Even with frequent suctioning, he had \nseveral further mucous plugging events with significant \ndesaturations requiring acute suction. The last such event was a \nnear respiratory arrest on the general medical floor requiring \nre-intubation. After lengthy discussion with his family, it was \ndecided to place a tracheostomy to attempt to minimize further \nmucous plugging events and ease suctioning, as he was having \nsignificant nasopharyngeal trauma from NT suctioning. Hyocamine \ntabs and mucomyst nebs were added to decrease and help clear \nsecretions. He will require frequent suctioning and close \nmonitoring of his airway to minimize further plugging events. \nThe family was made aware that the tracheostomy may not prevent \nfurther events and that his overall mortality in the next year \nis significant. They feel strongly that the patient would want \nto continue living no matter what the cost. Extensive \ndiscussions were held regarding goals of care and code status \nwith no change in his full code status. The family's overall \ngoal is to bring the patient home if at all possible. \n.\n# Respiratory Failure: As noted above, his last mucous plugging \nevent resulted in reintubation. He is in the process of weening \nventilatory support, currently on PS ventilation, ___, 40% with \ngood respiratory mechanics. His ventilatory support should \ncontinue to be weened as tolerated with possible trach collar \nsoon. Of note, given his poor right lung, it is unlikely that \nthe patient will ever have a satisfactory RSBI. Sputum culture \nfrom ___ grew pseudomonas and pan-sensitive klebsiella. The \npatient had no evidence of actual pneumonia at that time. It was \nfelt that the pseudomonas was likely a colonizer given that the \nexact same strain has been isolated from sputum cultures months \nprior. The klebsiella was concurrently treated during his 2 week \ncourse of ceftriaxone as above. Prior to discharge, a sputum \nculture was growing pseudomonas and one other gram negative rod. \nAgain, he had no other clinical signs of pneumonia so new \nantibiotics were not started. Further follow of sputum culture \nshould occur and if the patient decompensates, consideration of \nantibiotics treating pseudomonas should occur. \n.\n# Pyuria: Patient had a grossly positive UA.  Ceftriaxone and \nvancomycin were given initially. Piperacillin-tazobactam was \nadded and ceftriaxone discontinued when he became hypothermic \nand altered requiring ICU transfer. He was ultimately found to \nhave a VRE urinary tract infection. He was treated with \nlinezolid, with a recommended course of 7 days. .\n.\n# Hypothermia: On the first hospital day the patient's \ntemperature dropped to <96 farenheit.  Other vital signs were \nstable.  Given concominant leukopenia and positive UA, this was \nconcerning for sepsis.  Blood cultures were sent, and  warming \nblankets were placed.  The patient was transferred to the \nintensive care unit for closer monitoring in the setting of \nlikely sepsis, his antibiotic regimen was broadened to \nvancomycin\/zosyn. His hypothermia improved. He has been \nhypothermic on his last several admissions. It may be that his \nphysiologic response to infection is hypothermia rather than \nhyperthermia, or he is an outlier at the lower extreme of \ntemperature at baseline. On the floor after transfer out of the \nICU he initially needed a bearhugger to maintain temperatures \n>96 and cultures done at that time were negative. He eventually \nwas able to maintain temperatures ranging ___ without the \nassistance of a bear hugger. \n.  \n#. ESRD:  Family reported episode of fistula bleeding the \nprevious day.  Pressure dressing was in place on admission. Hct \nwas decreased, possible secondary to this.  Transplant surgery \ninitially evaluated the fistula and determined that it was \nfunctional and ready for use.  However, later on re-evaluation \ntransplant surgery felt that his fistula needed revision prior \nto discharge. This was done and further hemodialysis should be \navoided from his fistula for 2 weeks from ___. A tunnelled \nfemoral HD line was placed for HD access until that time under \n___ guidance.\nDialysis was continued MWF schedule. Midodrine was added to help \nimprove his BP prior to dialysis to assist with volume removal \nand to combat possible autonomic dysfunction given wide swings \nin blood pressure. \n.  \nEnlarged Thyroid: He had chest imaging to evaluate pulmonary \nfunction. An incidential finding of thyromegaly was noted. TFTs \nare recommended as an outpatient. \n.\n#. Hypernatremia:  This was likely secondary to hypovolemia and \nresolved.\n.  \n#. Coronary artery disease: Aspirin, and simvastatin were \ncontinued.\n.  \n#. Hypertension:  Lisinopril was continued.\n.\n#. Type II DM:  Oral hypoglycemics were initially held and ISS \ngiven, but restarted as his blood sugars became elevated. His \nlantus was increased from 12 U QHS to 16 U QHS with effect. \n.  \n.  \n#. Adrenal insufficiency- He is on 5mg prednisone daily at \nbaseline. There was an initial concern for sepsis, thus he got \nhigh dose steroids,however ___ stim test was wnl. He was thus \ntapered, and returned to his home dose of 5mg daily prior to \ndischarge. \n.\n#. Access:  He has poor vasculature. Initial PICC was placed \nwhich was pulled back to midline prior to discharge as it was \ncoming out a little.  \n.\n#.

Persistent \nhyperdense blood products along the right lateral convexity. \n\nCXR ___:\nNo focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia.  Low lung \nvolumes.\n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ with hypertension and diabetes who is admitted after being \ndischarged on ___ after resection of craniopharyngioma on ___ \nwith central diabetes insipidus and headache.\n\n# Central diabetes insipidus: The patient has central diabetes \ninsipidus manifesting with hypernatremia, polyuria and \nsubstantial thirst in the post-neurosurgical setting. The \npatient had been managed with PO demospressin on discharge. \nThere was concern that the patient had taken her desmopressin \nwith food after discharge, which may have interfered with the \ndrug's absorption and led to her hypernatremia. \n\nThe patient was initially given D5W IV with good response in her \nsodium level. Endocrinology was consulted. The patient was \ninitially monitored with q4 hour serum sodium and urine specific \ngravity\/osmolality checks. A foley was placed and urine output \nwas monitored hourly. The patient was initially dosed with \ndesmopressin when she would \"break through\" with >300cc of urine \noutput per hour for two consecutive hours. Her desmopressin \ndosing was gradually stabilized to 0.2mg QHS, with strict \ninstructions to not take with food. The patient was strongly \nencouraged to drink to thirst. Her labs were spaced out to twice \ndaily. She still had occasional morning hypernatremia that was \nlikely a consequence of the patient not drinking fluids \novernight. When the patient was stabilized her foley was removed \nto reduce infection risk.\n\nThe patient was discharged to rehab on 0.1mg desmopressin BID at \n7am and 9pm. She was discharged with a ___ appointment in \nplace with her endocrinologist.\n\n# Headache: The patient had a headache on admission and \noccasionally throughout the admission. There was initially \nconcern for post-operative hematoma. She had a head CT scan \nwhich was not concerning to her neurosurgeons. Her headache \nimproved with Tylenol and tramadol. Her neurologic exam was \nunchanged.\n\n# Bilateral Eye pain\/episcleritis: On ___ the patient \ndeveloped bilateral eye pain with her headaches. Her eyes  were \ntender to the touch. Ophthalmology saw the patient. They \ndiagnosed her with episcleritis. Her pressure in the eyes were < \n12 and <10 in the R and L respectively, which was not concerning \nfor glaucoma. She was treated with artificial tears and \ntobramycin-dexamethasone drops with improvement of her eye pain. \n Of note, the patient had poor visual fields and acuity during \nthis admission, which per ophtho is her baseline. She was \ndischarged with a ___ appointment with ophthalmology.\n- continue tobramycin-dexamethasone 0.3 %-0.1 % 1 drop OPH: \nThree times a day from ___\n\n#Acute kidney injury: the patient had a creatinine bump to 1.3 \non ___, up fro her baseline of 0.9. This was likely from \nincreased urine output and relatively poor PO intake. On \ndischarge creatinine and BUN has decreased.  \n\n#Anemia: the patient had hemoglobins in the ___ range during \nthis admission. She had no obvious source of bleeding. Regular \nblood draws may have been contributing.\n\n#Thrombocytopenia: Pt developed a thrombocytopenia on ___ that \nhas been slowly downtrending. Today pt 107. Its unlikely to be \ninfectious given afebrile, normal WBC count and no indication of \ninfectious source. Still can be medication, acetamenophen is a \ncommon cause of thrombocytopenia and in <1% of cases Keppra can \ncause bone marrow suppression with thrombocytopenia. Broader \ndifferential is increased destruction or decreased production. \nCould be MAHA (DIC, HUS, TTP), since there is also an anemia. \nHad blood smear with 1+ rouleaux formation on peripheral smear; \nshould follow up with PCP for further workup as indicated\n\n# Craniopharyngioma. The patient had her brain tumor resected on \nher prior admission. During this admission we continued her \npituitary hormone replacement regimen as per endocrinology. In \naddition to her desmopressin as above, we continued \nlenothyroxine, prednisone, and keppra prophylaxis.\n\n# Diabetes: chronic. The patient was given an insulin sliding \nscale during this admission with good control of her blood \nsugars. \n\n# Left toe pain: Pt has about a week of tow pain on left toe, \npossibly with joint involvement. Tender to palpation, not \nerythematous, hard to tell whether it is warm to palpation due \nto warm compress. Could be gout, but unlikely infectious. \n- Continue to use warm compress\n- Increased dose of acetaminophen \n\n***TRANSITIONAL ISSUES***\n- 0.1mg Desmopressin BID at 7am and 9pm on empty stomach\n- continue to monitor electrolytes once daily\n- encourage PO fluid intake\n- levothyroxine 50mcg at 6am on empty stomach\n- Appointment with Dr. ___ endocrine ___ \n- f\/u appointment at the ___ clinic on ___ \n- patient has anemia and thrombocytopenia with 1+ rouleaux \nformation on peripheral smear; should follow up with PCP for \nfurther workup as indicated\n- please follow up with outpatient iron labs\n- started iron supplements \n- monitor toe pain, treat pain with Tylenol\n- ___ with ophthalmology for episcleritis\n- continue tobramycin-dexamethasone 0.3 %-0.1 % 1 drop OPH: \nThree times a day from ___\n- Patient should not drive until she has had formal visual \nacuity and visual field testing performed at ophthalmology \nappointment\n- Contact: ___ ___ \n- Code: Full \n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

The history and exam was \nsuggestive of hypomania, but further evaluation for medical \ncauses of alterred mental status were pursued given his history \nof immunosuppresion in the setting of liver transplant.  The \npatient endorsed marijuana use, but denied any other illicit \ndrug use and his tox screens were negative.  There was initially \na concern for tacrolimus toxicity given his elevated level to \n17.1 on ___, although this was felt to be an inaccurate \ntrough level as his repeat tacrolimus level was 3.5. No \nmeningeal signs on exam to suggest meningitis. Extensive \ninfectious workup was unrevealing (negative urinalysis, negative \nCXR, RPR negative, HIV negative, CMV viral load undetected, lyme \nnegative, EBV tested in the past c\/w previous infection, HSV ___ \npositive).  While HSV was positive, MRI of the brain was largely \nunremarkable and neurological exam was unremarkable. EEG was \nentirely normal. Metabolic workup, including TSH was also \nunrevealing.  \n\nOn admission, venlafaxine was discontinued.  The patient's home \ncyclobenzaprine, mirtazapine, and gabapentin were also held as \nthey can contribute to AMS.  Tacrolimus was initially held as \nwell, but was restarted after the repeat tacrolimus level of 3.5 \nand normal MRI of the brain.  Psychiatry was consulted, who felt \nhis alterred mental status was likely Bipolar NOS (bipolar I or \nII vs med-induced).  The patient was started on olanzapine 5mg \nPO BID.  He was also given Ativan 0.5mg PO for anxiety.  He was \nplaced on a 1:1 sitter.  The patient was medically cleared for \npsychiatric admission.    \n\n## Status post orthotopic liver transplant: \nThe patient had no evidence of decompensation of donor liver on \nadmission.  His liver function tests were largely unremarkable.  \nHe had no evidence of hepatic encephalopathy or ascites on exam. \n Tacrolimus intially held because it was elevated at 17.4 on \n___, although this was felt to be an inaccurate trough \nlevel as his repeat tacrolimus level was 3.5.  Tacrolimus was \nrestarted at his home dose of 2mg Q12H.  He was discharged at a \ntherapeutic level.  He was continued on his home dose of \nmycophenolate and ursodiol.  Dapsone was held since he is more \nthan ___ year status post liver transplant.  \n\n## Hepatic artery stenosis s\/p stent placement ___:  \nDuring his hospitalization, he was continued clopidogrel and \naspirin.  \n\n## Hypertension:\nDuring his hospitalization, he was continued on his home \nMetoprolol Tartrate and Amlodipine, with adequate blood pressure \ncontrol.\n\n=============================\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES\n=============================\n# Dapsone was discontinued since patient is more than a year \nstatus post liver transplant. \n# Consider d\/c'ing mycophenalate in the future since he is more \nthan ___ year s\/p liver transplant \n# Venlafaxine d\/c'ed as it may have unmasked Bipolar disorder\n*Full Code\n*Contact: Sisters: ___ (primary) and ___ \n(alternate); ___ ___ ___ ___ \n___\n\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

There is unchanged prominence \nof the left pulmonary artery. Otherwise, the hilar, \ncardiomediastinal and pleural surfaces appear normal. There is \nno pneumothorax. There is crowding of the pulmonary vasculature \nat bilateral bases as a result of incomplete respiration.  \n.  \n# Cardiac Perfusion Persantine (___): The image quality is \nadequate. Left ventricular cavity size is normal. Rest and \nstress perfusion images reveal uniform tracer uptake throughout \nthe left ventricular myocardium. Gated images reveal normal wall \nmotion. The calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is \n54%. No prior study available for comparison.

Appropriate hemodynamic response to the \nPersantine infusion. Nuclear report sent separately.  \n.  \n# CT chest (From ___: The extensive right upper lobe scar, \npartly calcified, is overall unchanged in size. Only the part of \nthe opacity directly adjacent to the mediastinum has minimally \ndecreased. Unchanged background of severe emphysema and moderate \nbronchopathy. Persistent left pulmonary arterial enlargement. No \npleural effusions, no pericardial effusions, unchanged extensive \ncoronary calcifications. Status post cholecystectomy, no \nosteolytic bone lesions. The overall stability in shape and size \nof the right upper lobe lesion supports the assumption of a \npost-infectious scar. This is further supported by the absence \nof signs suggesting malignancy, such as lymphadenopathy or \npleural effusions. However, lesion should be further followed by \nCT, but with longer intervals, for example in six months. PET-CT \ncould be considered to exclude metabolic activity.  \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nASSESSMENT: \n___ is a ___ year old female with a history of asthma, \nemphysema, CV disease, high BP, high cholesterol, NIDDM, R \nbreast cancer, who presents with chest pain concerning for \npossible unstable angina, as well as shortness of breath.  After \nher ED course, pain resolved and feelings of acute shortness of \nbreath resolved, however low O2 saturations in the ED on \nexertion to 79% were concerning, and patient was admitted for \nfurther work up.\n.\nPLAN:  \n*Chest pain: Patient presented with acute onset of chest \npressure, jaw pain and arm pain. Although she generally has \nabout ___ episodes a week that are relieved by nitroglycerin, \nthis episode was notable for no decrease in pain with treatment. \nAdditionally, the specific symptoms of jaw pain and chest \npressure are not present with her usual episodes of chest pain. \nHer labs are notable for negative troponin, that was trended and \nremained negative.  Stress test showed no anginal symptoms or \nischemic ST segment changes.  Nuclear stress test was performed \nas well which showed no new changes in heart function or \nperfusion.  Given the lack of F\/C, time course of chest pain, \nand symptoms, suspect that her chest pain symptoms were not \nattributable to flow-limiting coronary disease.  She did not \nhave a recurrence of pain, and her vital signs and telemetry \nwere monitored and stable throughout admission.  She will follow \nup with her PCP for further management.    \n.  \n*Shortness of breath: Patient noted shortness of breath on \nadmission.  Her D-Dimer in the ED was negative, given her low \nWell's criteria score, and low clinical suspicion, no additional \ntests for PE were performed as this effectively r\/o \nthromboembolic process.  No recent history of URI, so less \nlikely to be infectious. Given the timing of SOB coinciding with \nchest pain, likely cardiac or COPD exacerbation. On the floor, \nO2 sat have been recorded in ___ without O2. Prior to discharge, \nit was determined that with exertion, O2 min on RA --> 83, O2 \nmin on 1L --> 88, O2 min on 2L --> 90. ABG showed pH of 7.39, \npO2 of 72, pCO2 of 42. Likely due to chronic COPD.  Pulmonology \nsaw her and thought this is most likely due to her long-standing \nCOPD that has likely been chronic, and that this hypoxia is most \nlikely not a new event. They recommended an ECHO with bubble \nstudy to rule out right to left shunting as an outpatient and \nrecommended home O2.  On day of discharge, patient was \ncomfortable, 96% on 2L O2, without chest pain or shortness of \nbreath.   \n.  \n*Anemia: patient has anemia on CBC with most recent Hct of 31.7. \nThis appears to be non-acute and did not down trend while \nadmitted.  Continued home B12 supplement, and continue to \nmonitor on outpatient basis.\n.\nTransitions of Care:\nFull Code\nF\/U with PCP: ___ getting ECHO w\/bubble study to evaluate \nfor shunt\nF\/U with pulmonology for PFTs\n \nMedications on Admission:\nAdvair (250\/50 1 puff 1am\/1pm)  \nAtivan 0.5 mg (1am\/1pm)  \nAtenolol 50 mg (1 daily AM)  \nCarafate (10 mg 2 tsp daily)  \nRosuvastatin (Crestor) 20 mg (1 daily pm)  \nEffexor 75 mg (1 daily am)  \nGlucagon 1 mg IM Q15MIN:PRN hypoglycemia protocol  \nPantoprazole 40 mg (2 daily am + pm)  \nMetformin 500 mg (1 am + 1 pm)  \nClopidogrel (Plavix) 75 mg (1 daily am)  \nProvenil inhaler (2 puffs up to 4 times daily)  \nRinitidine 150 mg (2 daily am + pm)  \nSpiriva powder inhaler (1 puff daily)  \nTrazodone 225 mg (150 mg 1.5 times daily)  \nFenofibrate (Tricor) 48 mg (1 daily am)  \nB-12 1000 mcg (1 daily am)  \nCalcium + D 1200 mg (2 daily am + pm)  \n\n \nDischarge Medications:\n1. atenolol 50 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).  \n2. clopidogrel 75 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY \n(Daily).  \n3. metformin 500 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a \nday).  \n4. ranitidine HCl 150 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 \ntimes a day).  \n5. cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) 400 unit Tablet Sig: Two (2) \nTablet PO DAILY (Daily).  \n6. venlafaxine 75 mg Capsule, Ext Release 24 hr Sig: One (1) \nCapsule, Ext Release 24 hr PO DAILY (Daily).  \n7. calcium carbonate 200 mg calcium (500 mg) Tablet, Chewable \nSig: One (1) Tablet, Chewable PO BID (2 times a day).  \n8. cyanocobalamin (vitamin B-12) 1,000 mcg Tablet Sig: One (1) \nTablet PO qAM (once every morning).  \n9. albuterol sulfate 2.5 mg \/3 mL (0.083 %) Solution for \nNebulization Sig: Two (2)  Inhalation every six (6) hours as \nneeded for SOB or wheeze.  \n10. lorazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times \na day).  \n11. fluticasone 50 mcg\/Actuation Spray, Suspension Sig: Two (2) \nSpray Nasal DAILY (Daily).  \n12. fluticasone-salmeterol 250-50 mcg\/dose Disk with Device Sig: \nOne (1) Disk with Device Inhalation BID (2 times a day).  \n13. pantoprazole 40 mg Tablet, Delayed Release (E.C.)

Heart size is within normal limits.  There is minimal \natelectasis at the left lung base.  There is no focal \nconsolidation, pleural effusions or signs for acute pulmonary \nedema.  No pneumothoraces are identified. \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nMr. ___ is a ___ year old man with HgbSS disease, recurrent \nvasoocclusive crises, history of priapism, chronic hep C (viral \nload undetectable at ___ in ___ and polysubstance abuse who \npresented to ___ with acute onset low back pain consistent \nwith vasoocclusive crisis. \n\nActive diagnoses:\n#Vasoocclusive crises: He was admitted for a 1 day history of \nsevere lower back pain in the setting of a Hemoglobin SS disease \n(sickle cell disease). Smear was suggestive of active sickling \nand hemolysis making the cause of his pain likely an acute pain \ncrisis. Pain was limited to the R paraspinal area of the lumbar \nspine and there was no evidence of midline lumbar spine \ninvolvement (no tenderness to palpation). There was no evidence \nof priapism (he has a prior Hx of priapism).  Treatment \nconsisted of pain control and IVFs with ___ normal saline. Pain \nwas adequately controlled per the patient and by HD#2 and the \npain had returned to his baseline. He was actually treated with \nless than his home regimen of oxycodone. He also received 1 u \npRBCs on HD #1 which likely contributed to his improvement. His \nhemoglobin at discharge was 7.5. This is within his historical \nrange for hemoglobin at discharge from ___ in the \npast few months. He should have a follow up CBC on ___ in \n___ clinic. Home folate and hydroxyurea were continued.   \n   \n\n#Hypoxemia: In the late morning on hospital day #1 he was found \nto have O2 sats to the mid-80s on room air. His saturation \nquickly improved to >95% on 2L of O2. On further auscultation he \nappeared to have decreased breath sounds and dullness to \npercussion at the R lung base. However, a CXR was done and no \nmajor consolidation was noted.  The etiology of his hypoxemia \nremains unclear, though it was most likely related to \nhypoventilation as he was very somnolent on hospital day #1. \nAcute chest crisis (ACS) was unlikely given his normal CXR and \nlack of chest pain or shortness of breath. On the day of \ndischarge he was 94% on room air and his lungs were clear on \nexamination.\n\n#Hemoglobin SS disease\/Macrocytic Anemia: On initial \npresentation to the ED (___) his Hct was 23.3.  The following \nmorning (___), his Hct was noted to have dropped to 20.8, \nthough after significant IV fluid. His anemia was likely due to \na hemolysis from sickle cell disease, as confirmed by labs and \nperipheral smear. His bilirubin was elevated (6.4. total), \nhaptoglobin level decreased (<5), LDH elevated (612) and \nreticulocyte was increased (12.8), as expected with a hemolytic \nanemia. He was transfused with 1 unit of pRBCs. On repeat Hct he \nwas 23.1. He should have outpatient CBC done on ___ in \n___ clinic. \n\n#Somnolence: Upon admission to the floor (HD #1) he was noted to \nhave significant somnolence, often appearing to doze off during \nhistory taking and physical exam.  This was thought to be due to \novermedicating with pain medications and so his oxycodone and \nhydromorphone doses were reduced. It was also thought that he \nmay have ingested other substances prior to admission, including \nlong acting oxycodone, which he has at home. He has a history of \nsubstance abuse and was noted to have ingested cocaine this \nweekend. Tox screening from the ED was negative though it did \nnot test for opiates and is unreliable for certain \nbenzodiazepines. He did not produce a urine sample for testing \nfor methadone and other CNS depressants. Given his return to \nnormal mental status on HD#2 it is highly likely that his period \nof AMS was due to overmedication. He was counseled to avoid \nexcessive narcotic use and combinations with other drugs. He was \nprescribed a bowel regimen given his chronic opiate use. \n\nChronic Diagnoses: \n#Chronic Hepatitis C: Possibly resolved. Hep C antibody positive \n___. Viral load negative at ___ in ___, though \nit is unclear if he was treated or cleared the infection \nhimself. This is related to blood transfusions for Sickle Cell \nDisease, per patient and chart review. He denies prior IV drug \nuse. Could consider repeating viral load or clarifying treatment \nwith patient to ensure no longer has active disease that would \nrequire treatment. \n\n#Polysubstance abuse: He reported that he had used cocaine a day \nor two prior to admission - this is an issue that his outpatient \nhematologist has spoken with him about before and which will \nneed further outpatient workup as it is likely an exacerbating \nfactor for his underlying sickle cell disease. He was counseled \nto avoid excessive narcotic use and combinations with other \ndrugs. He was prescribed a bowel regimen given his chronic \nopiate use. \n\nTransitional Issues:  \n-repeat CBC in 2 weeks to evaluate Hgb\/Hct\n-consider down-titration of opiates given somnolence when \nadmitted on less than home doses of oxycodone\n-set up outpatient PCP, currently ___ NP \nmanaging his care, though he stated he was getting a new PCP\n-___ repeating HCV viral load or clarifying treatment with \npatient to ensure no longer has active disease that would \nrequire treatment. \n\n \n\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

What is a collapsed lung? A collapsed lung, also called a pneumothorax, happens when air enters the space between your rib cage and one of your lungs. The air causes all or part of the lung to collapse. It is then hard to breathe normally and your body gets less oxygen. A collapsed lung can be life-threatening. In some cases, the air collecting around the lung can completely collapse the lung and put pressure on the heart. Then the heart cannot pump normally. A collapsed lung may be caused by an injury to the chest, such as a car accident, stab or bullet wound, or broken ribs.

Patient is CPR\/Intubation not \nindicated - confirmed by two attending physicians and documented \nin Metavision.\n\n#Septic and Hypovolemic Shock ___ bacteremia\/fungemia:\nPatient w\/poor PO intake and chronic aspiration prior to \nadmission to MICU. Extensive microbiologic workup negative for \nlegionella, C. diff. Found on imaging to have a multifocal \npneumonia in setting of aspiration given daughter's ___ \nfeeding with regular diet and septicemia with streptococcus, \nlactobacillus, and C. albicans. Initially patient was treated \nwith Vancomycin\/Zosyn which after consultation with the \ninfectious disease team was transitioned to ceftriaxone, \nclindamycin, fluconazole. The streptococcus anginosus species is \nseen commonly in oral flora, and in abscesses. Patient remained \nvery fluid responsive, and was successfully weaned off pressors \non ___ via IVF resuscitation and transferred to the floor \nwhere he remained hemodynamically stable with continuation of IV \nabx. \n\n# Coffee Ground Emesis: Possible ulcers vs. gastritis. Multiple \nepisodes at home on ___ at 0200 along with diarrhea and per \ndaughter multiple episodes since. Trace guaiac positive stools \nin ED. Patient was initially placed on PPI gtt in ED, \ntransitioned to BID IV PPI. A central line and large bore IVs \nwere placed. Given no indication of ongoing bleeding, no further \ninterventions were performed during hospitalization in regards \nto the coffee ground emesis. Patient had no further episodes of \nhemetemesis and IV PPI was discontinued upon discharge. \n\n# Tropinemia: Elevated troponin in ED. Heart rate initially > \n140 with question of demand ischemia with ST segment \ndepressions. Improved with fluids and reduction in HR. Troponin \nand CKMB remained flat after admission and with improving \nclinical status. \n\n# Diarrhea: Unclear etiology, likely another reason for \npatient's hypotension. He was volume resuscitated, receiving IVF \nas appropriate. C. dif was negative, and loperamide was provided \nas needed for diarrhea.\n\n# ___: Up from baseline 0.6-0.8.

Concern was also raised for your left lower extremity swelling to possibly be a skin infection known as cellulitis. We began a course of antibiotic therapy first with Vancomycin and then with Clindamycin, Meropenem, and finally Bactrim. After this course of management, your symptoms improved and no signs of infection were evident."}

The patient had a left SFA \nocclusion and presented to the hospital on ___ for a scheduled \nleft common femoral artery to above-knee popliteal artery bypass \ngraft using 6 mm ringed Propaten PTFE.  There were no \ncomplications during the surgery.  She was part of the silver \ntrial, so post-op dressings were removed on POD 3.  She \ninitially received Vancomycin, Ciprofloxacin and Flagyl later \nchanged to Augmentin. Patient had multiple bed-side debridements \nof a left heel ulcer.  Cx grew coagulase positive staph.  She \nwill complete a 4 week course of Augmentin on ___. Her post \noperative course was complicated by hepatic encephalopathy, \nhyponatremia, ___ and SBP. She will follow up with Dr. ___ in \none month. \n\n# Oliguric Acute Renal Failure: Creatinine trended up from \nbaseline of 0.4-0.9 to 2.5 on POD 5 and urine output decreased. \nLikely ATN likely given the vancomycin level of 47, fluid \nrestriction for hyponatremia, diuretics, hypotension post-op and \ndiarrhea secondary to lactulose and gradual improvement. \nInitially HRS was also considered given sodium avidity on urine \nlytes and lack of response to albumin. Diuretics (lasix and \nspironolactone) held. Midodrine and Octreotide titrated up to \nmax doses, eventually discontinued as Creatinine trende down.  \nCreatinine peaked at 4.5 on ___ and began to trend down with \ntime and multiple doses of albumin and finally normalized by the \ntime of discharge. Discharge Cr 0.9.  \n\n# SBP: Diagnostic paracentesis on ___ showed peritoneal \nfluid with 565 polys. SAAG of 2.7 was consistent with ascites \nfrom portal hypertension. She received Albumin and Ceftriaxone. \nRepeat Paracentesis on ___ negative for SBP. Patient's \ncurrent secondary prophylaxis coveraged by Augmentin. Once \nAugmentin is discontinued on ___, patient should start \nCiprofloxacin 500mg BID. \n\n# Hepatic Encephalopathy: Patient became encephalopathy after \nsurgery. A combination of hepatic encephalopathy and general \nanesthesia likely cause. Patient recovered quickly with \nincreased lactulose. \n\n# Primary Biliary Cirrhosis: Decompensated cirrhosis with \nascites, jaundice, varices with history of GI bleed, and \nencephalopathy. Last EGD on ___ with 3 cords of grade II \nvarices. Her MELD score was 9 in ___ and increased to 32 before \ntrending down to 17 on discharge. Lactulose, rifaxmin, nadolol \nand ursodiol were continued. Patient had further decompensation \nwith INR trending up during this hospital course from 1.2 on \nadmission to peak fo 2.1 and 1.7 on discharge.  Lasix 40mg BID \nand Spironolactone 50mg daily were held in the setting of ___. \nUpon discharge restarted at decreased doses of Lasix 20mg daily \nand Spironolactone 50mg daily. The patient is a potential \ntransplant candidate, her transplant workup was expedited during \nthis hospital course. Necessary workup remaining includes an \noutpatient mammogram. \n\n# Insulin Dependant Diabetes Mellitus and hypoglycemia: DM \ncomplicated by neuropathy and nephropathy. Patient at home has \n40 units of NPH in the morning and sliding scale NPH at night. \nPatient had multiple episodes of hypoglycemia during the \nhospital stay.

Your initial CT scan showed a small area of bleeding on the surface of your brain, and a follow up MRI of your head showed signs of an old stroke as well as multiple small new strokes. As your blood vessel imaging did not show signs of significant vascular disease, it is likely that the clots leading to your strokes came from your heart. In discussing with your outpatient cardiologist, you were previously found to have a connection between your heart chambers (patent foramen ovale - PFO) that may predispose you to strokes. An ultrasound of your heart (transthoracic echocardiogram) was performed with prelim read confirming the PFO with no other valvular abnormalities. We strongly recommended a follow-up endoscopic study (transesophageal echocardiogram), but you instead elected to have this procedure done as an outpatient. This was discussed with your cardiologist, who will follow up with you to schedule the transesopagheal echocardiogram, ultrasound studies of your legs, and heart rhythm monitoring. In the meantime, we again started you on aspirin and a cholesterol medication (atorvastatin) to reduce your risk of future strokes."}

Physiologic PR. \n\nPERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.  \nConclusions  \nThe left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall \nthickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal \n(LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left \nventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular \nchamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve \nleaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet \nexcursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The \nmitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral \nregurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure \ncould not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion. \n\nCompared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, \nthere is less mitral regurgitation. A bubble study was not \nperformed. Other findings are similar.   \n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nBRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE\n======================\nMr. ___ is a ___ year old gentleman with advanced PBC, listed \nfor liver transplant, and fairly recent hemorrhagic pericarditis \ns\/p pericardial window (___) who presented with abdominal \npain, weakness, and lightheadedness. His abdominal pain was \nlikely from constipation. His lightheadedness was presyncopal in \nnature and improved by discharge.\n\nACTIVE ISSUES\n==============\n# Abdominal Pain due to constipation: He reported post-prandial \nabdominal pain without rebound\/guarding. LFTs and Tbili were \nlargely unchanged from baseline, though INR was elevated in the \nsetting of stopping PO vitamin K. He actually had a recent \nadmission with abdominal pain which was attributed to \nconstipation; he had an abdominal x-ray done which showed feces \nthroughout the colon.RUQ ultrasound with doppler was not \nconcerning for thrombotic event. Stool studies, including c. \ndiff, were not revealing. Bowel regimen was uptitrated with BID \nmiralax (for stool bulking), senna, lactulose.\n  \n# Lightheadedness: He reported presyncopal symptoms on two \noccasions while urinating, another time while at ___ eating \na meal, and once while eating during this admission. History was \nmost consistent with vasovagal symptoms. His orthostatics were \nnegative twice.  EKG without new changes. Cardiac enzymes were \nflat. Given history of hemorrhagic pericarditis s\/p window, with \ncoagulopathy, and a great deal of ___ concern regarding \nlightheadedness, he underwent TTE to evaluate for pericardial \neffusion, which did not show any accumulation of fluid. Of note \nhe did not have physiology concerning for significant \npericardial effusion. He was encouraged to hydrate daily with \nfluids such as gatorade.\n\nCHRONIC ISSUES\n===============\n# Coagulopathy: INR on previous admission ranged ___ but on \nrecent discharge had been 1. He was treated until recently with \ndaily vitamin K (hepatologist discontinued his vitamin K \nrecently). INR elevation likely from discontinuation of vitamin \nK, though worsening liver synthetic function also possible. \n  \n# Pancytopenia: CBC, WBC, and platelets were largely within \nrecent baseline.\n  \n# Primary Biliary Cirrhosis: He has advanced PBC and is \ncurrently listed for transplant. His MELD score on admission was \n26. Recent EGD on ___ did not show evidence of varices. \nAlbumin 4.1 and his coagulopathy was previously corrected fully \nwith Vitamin K, suggesting relatively intact synthetic function. \nHe was continued on ursodiol 300mg q6h.\n\n# Gastritis \/ Esophagitis:  Continued on home omeprazole, \nranitidine, sucralfate, and clotrimazole troches.\n\n# History of recent hemorrhagic pericarditis: Please see \ndiscussion above. He is s\/p pericardial window ___ and \nreports has had chronic chest pain ever since. Avoid NSAIDs due \nto liver disease. EKG, echo not concerning for repeat \neffusion\/pericarditis.\n\n# Hyperlipidemia: He has highly elevated cholesterol due to his \nPBC, and most recent lipid panel on ___ with TC 724, ___ \n311, HDL 12, and LDL 141. The benefit of statins in PBC is \nunclear, and statins can certainly be associated with liver \ninjury. He reports that his hepatologist discontinued his home \natorvastatin, and this was held in house as well.\n \n# Vitamin D Deficiency: His last Vitamin D level on ___ was \nundetectable.

He was transferred to the \nmedicine service for hypoxia and atrial fibrillation. His \nhypoxia improved with diuresis, but still occurred with \nambulation. His afib was controlled with metoprolol. He was \ndischarged home. \n\n# Hypoxia\n# COPD due to alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency with acute \nexacerbation\nPatient with new-onset hypoxia while inpatient. Cause is likely \nmultifactorial. Likely from splinting from pain + pulmonary \nedema RVR and IVF + COPD exacerbation. CTA was negative for PE. \nPatient was given one dose of Lasix for diuresis. He was given \nincentive spirometer and DuoNebs. He was continued on tiotropium \ndaily, and fluticasone\/salmeterol BID. His oxygen requirement at \nrest gradually resolved during hospitalization, however he was \nstill desatting on ambulation at time of discharge, and was \ndischarged with home O2. Please continue to monitor ambulatory \noxygenation. \n\n# Afib \n# Mild right ventricle hypokinesis\nPatient went into afib with RVR two separate times during the \nhospitalization that broke with 5mg IV metoprolol. His rates \nwere controlled on metoprolol succinate 25mg daily. This appears \nto be newly diagnosed afib. Trigger likely pain from fall and \nvolume overload given fluids patient received in ED. However, \ngiven his comorbidities, it's also possible that patient has had \nafib for quite some time and has just been undiagnosed. \nCHADSVASC=4. Echo with EF 55%, mild right ventricle. \nhypokinesis. Cardiology was consulted. Given his history of \nfalls, he was not discharged on anticoagulation.

Previously visualized area of patchy opacity within \nthe superior segment of the right lobe is again seen, but \nappears less confluent. Bronchiectasis changes are again \nvisualized throughout the right lower lobe. Sub-4mm \npleural-based nodules are again visualized within the right \nupper lobe and lingula, stable in comparison to prior studies \n(2:18 and 36). The lungs are without any new consolidations.   \nThe heart remains massively enlarged as seen previously, with \nextensive \natherosclerotic calcifications of the coronary arteries. \nPacemaker leads \nappear stable. Note is again made of gynecomastia. There is \nstable mediastinal lymphadenopathy, with the largest node in the \nprecarinal region measuring up to 12 mm, likely reactive. \nCT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT ORAL OR IV CONTRAST: Evaluation of the \nabdominal \nstructures is again limited by the lack of intravenous contrast. \nThe liver \nappears to be shrunken with a nodular contour. Stable \ncalcification is again visualized in segment VI. There is a \nsmall amount of abdominal ascites, decreased in comparison to \nprior study from ___. The pancreas is atrophic but \nstable.

The patient \nremains status post splenectomy with a small amount of splenosis \nin the left upper quadrant, which remains unchanged. The \nstomach, visualized loops of small and large bowel, and \nbilateral adrenal glands are within normal limits. The abdominal \naorta has extensive atherosclerotic changes, but normal in \ncaliber and contour. Pathologic lymphadenopathy through the \nabdomen.No retroperitoneal hematoma is present and there is no \nfree air.  \nCT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT ORAL OR IV CONTRAST: The bladder, \nrectum, and \nvisualized portions of sigmoid colon are within normal limits. \nThere is a \nsmall amount of free fluid in the pelvis.

Small right pleural effusion.   \n4. Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.\n\n___ EGD\nBirth Date: ___ ___ years) Instrument: ___) \n\nID#: ___   \nMedications: MAC Anesthesia \n \nIndications: cirrhosis rule out varices\nDysphagia\n \nProcedure: The procedure, indications, preparation and potential \ncomplications were explained to the patient, who indicated his \nunderstanding and signed the corresponding consent forms. A \nphysical exam was performed. The patient was administered \nmoderate sedation. Supplemental oxygen was used. The patient was \nplaced in the left lateral decubitus position and an endoscope \nwas introduced through the mouth and advanced under direct \nvisualization until the third part of the duodenum was reached. \nCareful visualization of the upper GI tract was performed. The \nprocedure was not difficult. The patient tolerated the procedure \nwell. There were no complications. \nFindings: Esophagus:  \n Other No varices  \nStomach:  \n Mucosa: Two erosions of the mucosa was noted in the body on the \ngreater curve. Patchy erythema of the mucosa was noted in the \nantrum. These findings are compatible with gastritis.  \nDuodenum:  \n Flat Lesions A single medium angioectasia was seen in the \ndistal bulb.  \nImpression: No varices\nErosion in the ___ greater curve\nErythema in the antrum compatible with gastritis\nAngioectasia in the distal bulb\nOtherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum \nRecommendations: If any questions or you need to schedule an \noffice appointment or procedure call ___ MD at \n___ or email at ___ \nAdditional notes: FINAL DIAGNOSES are listed in the impression \nsection above. Estimated blood loss = zero. No specimens were \ntaken for pathology \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nPt is an ___ yo man with history of chronic systolic CHF (last EF \n40%), pulmonary HTN, severe TR, diabetes type 2 now controlled \noff meds, afib on warfarin and congestive cirrhosis, who \npresents with abdominal pain and hypotension, and found to have \nacute on chronic renal insufficiency, hyponatremia and \nalkalosis. Pt was initially admitted to the MICU given \nhypotension. He was given IVF's and his SBP improved into the \n100s.\n.\n#. Hypotension: Likely ___ hypovolemic etiology given clinically \ndry, elevated BUN\/Cr, recent increased diuresis and poor po \nintake. Patient in clinic recently noted to have weight of 115 \nlbs down from 135 lbs between ___ and ___. Pt had no s\/s \ninfection and no leukocytosis to suggest infectious etiology or \nsepsis. He was given IVF's and his BP improved. He was given one \ndose of Zosyn in the ED, though this was not continued on \nadmission. Cultures were sent. UA was unremarkable, and CXR \nwithout infiltrate. He was not continued on antibotics, and was \ngiven fluid resuscitation with IVF boluses. His SBP was in the \n100s on discharge. His hypotension was felt most likely to \noverdiuresis, and thus his spironolactone and furosemide dosages \nwere decreased as per medication reconcillation. We also lowered \nhis dose of Metoprolol given his borderline hypotension in \nhouse; this can be uptitrated in the future as needed. We also \ndiscontinued the patient's metolazone.\n.\n#. Acute on Chronic systolic CHF: With volume status restored, \npatient had slight volume overload and diuretics were slowly \nre-introduced. This was evidenced by right pleural effusion and \nincreased requirement for oxygen at rest. Physical exam of right \nlung base and symptoms of dyspnea improved over a few days when \ndiuretics were re-introduced at lower dose. ___ was held \nbecause of hypotenstion.\n.    \n#. Abdominal pain: Unclear etiology, but seemed to have resolved \nprior to admission. DDx includes constipation vs. SBP vs. \ncholelithiasis vs. pancreatitis vs. ileus vs. gastritis. Lipase \nis elevated, though clinically pt has no epigastric pain, and \nclinical story of location of pain and duration is not c\/w \npancreatitis. Pt is passing gas and had BM so ileus less likely, \nin addition to no obstruction seen on CT. Cholelithiasis \ncertainly possible given brief intermittent pain, that has now \nsince resolved. Elevated alk phos and AST could be explained by \nintermittent cholelithiasis. Given guaiac positive stools, \ngastritis also possible, though intermittent nature makes this \nless likely. LFTs were within normal limits, and RUQ u\/s showed \nno evidence of infection, although it did show coarse \nechotexture of the liver, with lobulated contour compatible with \ncirrhosis, a small amount of ascites, a small right pleural \neffusion, and cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis. \n \n#. Dysphagia: Patient was seen in hospital for a speeh and \nswallow evaluation. They recommend a diet of soft moist solids \nand thin liquids, as well as further evaluation by speech and \nswallow at his facility.\n\n#. GI bleed: Patient's Hct trended down in house and stool was \nconfirmed to be guiac positive. Upper endoscopy showed no \nvarices, but erosions in the stomach and vascular ectasia of the \nduodenum. No varices were seen. His coumadin was held for this \nprocedure and re-started afterwards. On discharge, his Hct was \ntrending upwards to 28.4 from 25 two days prior, and there was \nno frank blood or melena ever observed in his stool. This is \nlikely a slow, chronic GI bleed and felt to be stable. Iron \nsupplements continued.\n\n# Acute on chronic renal insufficiency: Likely pre-renal in \nsetting of poor po intake, and diuresis as discussed above. ATN \nalso possible given BP slightly lower than baseline. \nPost-obstructive etiologies much less likely on the \ndifferential. FeUrea 31%, suggestive of pre-renal etiology. He \nwas given IVF's as discussed above and ___ was trended down to \n1.2 on discharge, which is his baseline.\n  \n# Metabolic Alkalosis with resp compensation: Pt has significant \nalkalosis with HCO3 of 36 on admission, has been higher up to \n39. Suspect that this is contraction alkalosis ___ overdiuresis. \nABG obtained showed ___, suggestive of respiratory \ncompensation. Lytes were trended with correction of bicarb to 33 \non day of discharge.\n       \n# Elevated troponin: Trop was elevated to 0.25 from prior 0.11. \nHowever, in the setting of elevated Cr, this is the most likely \netiology. Reassuring that EKG unchanged, and pt has no chest \npain. CK, MB were stable upon a recheck during admission.\n     \n#. Hyponatremia: Hypovolemic hyponatremia as evidenced by \npicture of dehydration as discussed above. Na much lower from \nbaseline by ~ 10pts. Diuretics were held and he was given IVF's. \nNa was trended up to 135 on discharge secondary to IVF, good PO \nintake, and the holding of his diuretics.\n     \n#. Anemia: Microcytic, suspect iron deficiency. Possible \netiologies include upper slow bleed given brown stools, such \nerosions and duodenal ectasia. No reported bloody or black \nstools, which is reassuring. Hct on admission is 29, and \nbaseline is closer to ___. However, suspect that this is \nhemoconcentrated given picture of dehydration as discussed \nabove. Volume status was restored and Hct recovered to 28 on \nd\/c. Fe studies and retic count were sent, which showed no \nevidence of hemolysis, and without reticulocytosis to suggest \nbleeding. Iron studies were wnl. Patient was discharged back on \nhis home dose of 20 mg daily of omeprazole.\n  \n# Atrial fibrillation: Chronically on Warfarin, for CHADS 4 \n(CHF, HTN, Age and Diabetes). However, INR subtherapeutic on \nadmission to 1.3. Listed on dc summary and in some nursing notes \nper rehab, but not on primary list. Held Toprol XL initially \ngiven hypotension. Placed on heparin gtt briefly, but on \ndischarge was therapeutic on Coumadin at 5.5 mg Daily at 2.1. \nMetoprolol was re-started at 25mg PO daily before d\/c.\n \n# Lower extremity wounds: Exam c\/w venous stasis ulcers with no \nevidence of superinfection. Wound was consulted for care.\n      \n# Diabetes: last A1c from ___ 6.6. Not currently on any \nmedications for diabetes. Suspect that he no longer requires \nmeds given his weight loss. Placed on QID ___ and ISS, and was \ndischarged on diet control for diabetes.\n    \n# Hyperthyroidism: TSH 3.7 on ___. Besides weight loss, \nlikely ___ issues of poor po intake & diuresis, no other s\/s \nhyperthyroidism. Continued on methimazole 5mg daily.\n\nTransitional Issues:\n- Please monitor weights daily for change greater than 3 lbs in \nweight gain\n- Please have the patient follow-up with his CHF clnic, whom has \nbeen managing his medications.\n- Please follow-up ___ Blood cultures for any signs of \nmicroorganism growth (NGTD)\n- Please monitor fluid status daily, with low threshold to \nuptitrate spironolactone back to prior dosing.\n \nMedications on Admission:\n-aldactone 50mg 9pm, 25mg qam  \n-K-dur 10meq daily  \n-metolazone 2.5mg MWF  \n-ASA 81mg daily  \n-Docusate 100 bid  \n-Methimazole 5mg daily  \n-Torsemide 20mg 3 tabs bid  \n-oxygen 2L NC  \n-toprol XL 50mg daily  \n-prilosec 20mg daily  \n-MVI  \n-calcium carb 500 tid  \n-ferrous suldate 325mg q8pm  \n-VitD 400u 2 tabs daily.  \n-warfarin 5.5mg daily\n \nDischarge Medications:\n1. aspirin 81 mg Tablet, Chewable Sig: One (1) Tablet, Chewable \nPO DAILY (Daily).  \n2. docusate sodium 50 mg\/5 mL Liquid Sig: One (1)  PO BID (2 \ntimes a day).  \n3. methimazole 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily). \n \n4. torsemide 20 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO twice a day.  \n5.

In the hospital, you were given IV fluids and your blood pressure increased. We held your usual diuretics and you were able to eat soft foods well. Your level of red blood cells dropped for a few days and we were worried about you losing blood into your GI tract because we found evidence of a slow blood loss in your stool. An upper endoscopy showed an abnormal blood vessel in the stomach that may be leading to slow blood loss. There were no rapidly bleeding vessels seen in this study.

Initially there was \nconcern for HCAP (hospitalization w\/n 90 days for pneumonia) and \nshe was treated with Vancomycin\/Cefepime. On hospital day 2, she \nhad minimal cough and significant wheezing and her exam was more \nconsistent with COPD exacerbation. She was weaned off oxygen. \nShe was treated with frequent duonebs, advair, montelukast (home \nmedication). She received a 5-day burst of prednisone \n(40-40-60-60-60mg) from ___. She also received levaquin \nfrom ___, which was stopped due to low concern for \npneumonia. Her exam showed interval improvement in wheezing and \nshe was discharged to pulmonary rehab for further recovery. Her \noutpatient pulmonologist recently did a CT trachea which raised \nconcern for upper airway disease. She is scheduled to follow in \n___ clinic for further evaluation.\n\n___: Her Cr was 3.2 on ___ and downtrended to 1.5 on discharge \n(1.5 is her baseline). She had good urine output throughout. Per \nurine lytes on ___ showed FeNa <1% suggestive of pre-renal \netiology. It was thought that her ___ was secondary to low \neffective circulating volume in setting of fluid losses while \nbeing on valsartan.

In addition, \nthere could have been a contribution from vancomycin which she \nreceived on admission. Her Cr improved with IV fluids and \nholding home Torsemide. Given her changing kidney function, \nxarelto was briefly stopped and she was anticoagulated with \nheparin. On ___, she was restarted on  xarelto 15 mg. Her \nxarelto dose can be uptitrated by primary care provider, as \nneeded, based on kidney function. She was re-started on home \ndose Torsemide 10 mg PO daily on ___.

Left \nventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular \ncavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is \nnormal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal \n(LVEF 50-55%). There is no ventricular septal defect. The right \nventricular cavity is moderately dilated with mild global free \nwall hypokinesis. There is abnormal septal motion\/position \nconsistent with right ventricular pressure\/volume overload. The \nascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are \nmoderately thickened. There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve \narea 1.2-1.9cm2). The mitral valve leaflets are mildly \nthickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral \nregurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly \nthickened. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is \nseen. There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. \nThere is no pericardial effusion. \n\nCompared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, \nthe findings are similar. \n.\nEKG ___: Regular ventricular pacing with underlying atrial \nfibrillation and ventricular ectopy. Compared to the previous \ntracing ventricular ectopy is new.  \n.\nEKG ___: Ventricular pacing with underlying atrial \nfibrillation. Compared to the previous tracing there is no \nsignificant change. \n\n \n\n \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ is a ___ year old man with chronic diastolic CHF \nwho presented with SOB, DOE, and orthopnea and a large R pleural \neffusion after having his bumex dose recently decreased.  His \nwas admitted and believed to be in an acute on chronic diastolic \nCHF exacerbation and was given IV Lasix.  His pleural \nthoracentesis was delayed originally due to a supertherapeutic \nINR.  The day after admission, he developed rigors and a \ntemperature of 101.4.  He was started on epiric broad spectrum \ncoverage with Vancomycin, Cefipime and Flagyl.  His blood \ncultures at that time revealed MSSA bactermia and his coverage \nwas narrowed to Nafcillin starting on ___.  \n.\nThe nidus of his bacteremia was explored.  His thoracentesis \noccured hours after his rigors and he was found to have an \nexudative effusion by Lytes criteria, however, the effusion \ncultures and cytology were negative.  He had a CT of his chest \nwhich did not reveal any consolidation or pneumonia.  Of note, \nhe has history of pleural effusion with enterococcal bactermia \nin past.  His echocardiogram completed that showed LVEF 50-55%, \nmild aortic stenosis, mild mitral reguritation and moderate 3+ \ntricuspid regurgitation, and severe pulmonary systolic \nhypertension.  Due to suspicion for possible endocarditis in the \nsetting of 3+ TR and MSSA bacteremia, a TEE was completed which \ndid not show any valvular vegetations and his pacemaker was free \nof thrombus.  After the above workup was complete, the most \nlikely source for his bacteremia was his previous IV \nsites\/venopuncture sites on his forearms that initially appeared \nerythematous, indurated, and were tender.  Since antibiotics, \nthese lesions have improved.\n.\nThe patient continued on the Nafcillin until ___ when it was \nnoted by the following ID team that the patient's serum \neosinophils and creatinine were elevated raising concern for \npossible acute interstial nephritis secondary to nafcillin.  He \nwas switched to Cefazolin the evening of ___.  The morning of \ndischarge his serum eosinophils decreased and his creatine was \ntrending down.  He will be continued on Cefazolin for 8 \nadditional days, ending on ___.\n.\nThe patients acute on chronic renal failure more likely is \nattributed to volume depletion with a dry appearing physical \nexam, mild hyponatremia and FeNa 0.4%.  He received 250 cc \nboluses for 2 consecutive days, and one 500 cc bolus the day \nbefore discharge with improvement of his creatinine.  His Lasix \nwas stopped with the onset of bactermia and was held for the \nremainder of his admission.  His Bumex was held since admission. \n His Creatinine will need to be monitored daily, and once it \nreturns to normal, would consider restarting his Bumex.  His \ntrandalopril was also held due to low\/normal blood pressures and \nincrease in creatinine.  He may not require restarting this \nmedication considering normal EF and normotension.  \n.\nNote that the patient had witnessed aspiration and was evaluated \nby speech and swallow with a video swallow study.  He is at mild \nrisk of aspiration.  They suggest soft solids, thin liquids with \nsingle sips and pills with puree.  \n.\nThe patient's pleural effusion was likely due to a combination \nof mild aspiration and initial fluid overload\/ acute CHF \nexacerbation.\n.\nThe patient's anemia was worked up and found to be a combination \nof iron deficiency and B12 deficiency, he was started on both \niron and oral B12.  He was seen by the nutrition team who \nprovided suggestions for better iron and B12 intake.\n.\nThe patient has a history of hyperthyroidism with an elevated \nfree T4 and undetectable TSH upon admission.  His outpatient \nendocrinologist was called who suggested increasing his \nmethimazole from 10mg to 30mg daily.  The patient refused 30mg \ndaily, instead he was willing to take 20mg daily.  We recommend \nfollow up and rechecking TSH\/T4 in 6 weeks post discharge.\n.\nThe patient's other medical problems including DM2, \nhypertension, hyperlipidemia were all medically managed without \ncomplications.  He developed likely penile candidiasis and was \nstarted on meconazole powder with relief.  He had 2 episodes of \nloose stools after starting antibiotics, but was negative for \nCdiff, EColi, Salmonella, Shigella.  He later had hard stools.  \nHe was started on a bowel regimen as needed.  \n.\nINR upon hospital discharge 1.7.  Patient restarted on home \nwarfarin dosing on ___.  He will need to have daily INR \nchecks and adjustment of his warfarin as needed.\n.\nThe patient was full code for this admission. \n\n \nMedications on Admission:\n- ASA 81mg PO daily  \n- Atorvastatin 10mg PO daily  \n- Bumetanide 2mg PO daily  \n- Calcitriol 0.50mcg PO ___ and 0.25mcg PO \n___  \n- Fluticasone nasal spray 1 IH daily  \n- Folic acid 1mg PO daily  \n- Ferrex Forte MVI 1 capsule PO daily  \n- Methimazole 10mg PO daily  \n- Metoprolol succinate 50mg PO daily  \n- Repaglinide 1mg PO daily  \n- Trandolapril 2mg PO daily  \n- Warfarin 5mg PO ___ and 6.25mg PO ___.  \n.  \n\n \nDischarge Medications:\n1.

There is no evidence of new \nhemorrhage, edema, shift of the normally midline structures or \nherniation. There is no evidence of infarction. The ventricles \nand sulci are mildly prominent, likely due to age-related \natrophy. There is confluent periventricular white matter \nhypodensity consistent with chronic small vessel ischemic \ndisease.

Patient was evaluated \nfor her subdural hematoma in ED and it was found to be stable \nand not requiring acute neurosurgical intervention. She was \nadmitted to medicine for work up of her fall at home.\n.\n# Fall: Patient herself is giving a story of falling after \ngetting out of the bathroom after urinating in the middle of the \nnight. States that she was unable to get up after falling. \nSuspicion of seizure low as she did not exhibit any postictal \nconfusion, no loss of bowel\/bladder. No focal neurologic exam \nfinding and negative head CT (except for small subdural hematoma \nas below), which makes concern for stroke\/TIA less likely. \nCardiac work up-wise, patient was ruled out for MI\/ACS with two \nsets of negative cardiac enzymes in the hospital. Her EKG on \nadmission did not show any evidence of AV block or other \ndysrhythmias. Pt was monitored on telemetry overnight without \nevent. ? of orthostatic hypotension given patient's complaint of \ndizziness after her fall, but orthostatic vitals were negative \non admission, though it was after receiving 1 L of fluid in OSH \nED. ___ be due to reported weakness (with question of statin \nmyopathy vs. polymyalgia rheumatica) though patient denies \nweakness. Her hydrochlorothiazide was held in the setting of \nconcern for hypovolemia. \n___ consult was obtained to evaluate the patient for fall \nrisk. They recommended rolling walker for the patient as well as \nhome physical therapy. \n\n# Subdural hematoma: first noted on head CT at ___ \n___, and patient was transferred to ___ for neurosurgery \nevaluation. 2mm subdural hematoma stable on repeat imaging here. \nNeurosurgery thought it did not require any acute intervention \nat this time. They recommended holding aspirin for 2 days, so it \nwas held on ___ and ___. Patient will follow up with \nneurosurgery with repeat head CT in a month, and the appointment \nhas been made for her.\n\n# Hypertension: Patient was continued on home verapamil with \nholding parameters given concern for orthostatic hypotension \nleading to fall. HCTZ and potassium supplement were held given \nconcern for hypovolemia and hypotension, as patient's systolic \nblood pressure remained in 110s. It can be restarted as \noutpatient if her blood pressure tolerates it well.\n\n# Osteoarthritis: No complaint of pain, but concern for pain \ncontributing to fall\/weakness. Patient's home pain regimen of \n650 mg tylenol q8 hours prn and celebrex ___ mg qdaily prn were \ncontinued in house.\n\n# ?Osteoporosis: patient reports fosamax as one of her \nmedications, but not on medication reconciliation with Dr. \n___. Patient was continued on vitamin D and calcium \nsupplementation in house. \n\n# Hyperlipidemia: statin recently discontinued given suspicion \nof statin myopathy. Can consider restarting as outpatient, but \ngiven patient's age, has unclear benefit. \n\n# Overactive bladder: continued on home oxybutynin\n\n# Anemia: unknown baseline, but hematocrit ~35 in house and \nstable. No obvious signs of bleeding.\n\n# Hyperphosphatemia: On lab, patient noted to have phosphate of \n6.4 and total calcium of 9.2 (albumin not checked). Patient was \nasymptomatic. \n\nTransitional Issues:\n[ ] Hyperphosphatemia: unknown etiology, asymptomatic. Should be \nworked up as outpatient. \n[ ] Heterogeneous thyroid seen on CT c-spine - consider thyroid \nultrasound for further work up\n[ ] Left upper lobe mass - per report from ___, \n?appears moderately larger than on previous imaging done in \n___. Patient has refused work up in the past.\n[ ] Antihypertensives - HCTZ and potassium discontinued at \ndischarge. Can be restarted as outpatient if needed\n[ ] Clarify whether patient's taking fosamax\n[ ] Hyperlipidemia: Statin recently discontinued due to concern \nfor statin myopathy - CK checked on admission and was 30. \nConsider restarting statin, but given patient's age, unclear how \nmuch she'd benefit from primary prevention at this time\n[ ] Anemia: unknown baseline during this hospitalization, but \nstable.

On initial mental status exam, she was found to be \nawake, alert, and able to follow simple commands, but oriented \nonly to city, inattentive, tangential, restless, and unable to \ngive a history. Her speech was fluent but occasionally slurred \nand unintelligible or containing phonemic errors. No focal \nneurologic deficits were identified on the remainder of the \nexam, although the exam was limited by the patient's ability to \nfollow commands. General physical exam was unremarkable. Initial \nlabs and chest x-ray were unremarkable. Non-contrast head CT \nrevealed diffuse atrophy but no cute intracranial process. On \nreview of medications, had been on a stable low dose of Xanax \n(0.25 MG TID) for years, which she did not take for 2 days prior \nto presentation, possibly due to her confusion.\n\nAs no infectious or toxic-metabolic triggers for her altered \nmental status could be identified on initial work-up in the ED, \nshe was admitted to the Stroke Service in order to work up \npossible neurological etiologies of her altered mental status, \nsuch as stroke or seizure. Her home meds, including Xanax, were \nresumed. During the day on ___, on exam she was more somnolent, \nopening her eyes to loud voice, did not produce much speech, and \ndid not follow simple commands. She continuously reached out to \ngrab at blankets or the examiner. An EEG showed signs of diffuse \ncerebral dysfunction, with generalized theta and delta slowing \nof the background activity \nbut no epileptiform discharges or seizures. TSH and folate \nlevels were normal, vitamin B12 level was borderline low but \nwithin normal limits at 314. MRI showed extensive chronic white \nmatter ischemic change and at least moderate global atrophy, but \nno intracranial hemorrhage or acute infarction. Head and neck \nMRA were normal. Work-up for stroke risk factors (HbA1c, lipids, \netc.) was unrevealing.\n\nThere were no acute events overnight ___. On the morning of \n___, her mental status exam was improved from the previous day. \nShe was awake, alert, oriented to self, speaking with fluent and \ncomprehensible speech, following commands, and no longer \ndisplayed motor agitation. On bedside swallow evaluation she \nshowed aspiration across all liquid consistencies, and \nconsequently was made NPO and started on maintenance IV fluids. \n\nOvernight from ___, she had a short episode of tachycardia \nto 113 and some low grade fevers in the early morning, to a \nmaximum temperature of 100.6. She was given a bolus of 500 cc of \nnormal saline. She had no complaints of dyspnea. On exam she was \nwell-appearing without respiratory distress, and her mental \nstatus exam was further improved, with increased alertness and \norientation to both self and the hospital setting. Chest x-ray \nshowed no evidence of pneumonia and CBC showed normal WBC count, \nbut given her aspiration on bedside swallow and low-grade \nfevers, empiric broad spectrum antibiotic coverage with \nvancomycin and Unasyn was initiated. Through the rest of the day \nshe remained well-appearing and afebrile with stable vital signs \nand mental status. In the afternoon, she spiked a fever to \n102.8, that resolved the next morning. Her mental status \ncontinued to improve, and is now baseline. Medicine consult \ndetermined that her syndrome was most likely viral, and that \nantibiotics could be stopped.

He had been unable to tolerate any PO. \n\n___ year old man with a history of hypertension and gout who \npresented with upper abdominal pain for 2 days prior to \nadmission most likely due to gallstone pancreatitis leading to \ncholangitis.\n\n# CHOLANGITIS,\n# ACUTE PANCREATITIS LIKELY DUE TO CHOLEDOCOLITHIASIS:\nPatient presented initially to ___ with \nabdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. He was found to have a \nlipase >3000, AST 215, ALT 102, ALP 323, Tbili 2.1. RUQ \nultrasound was notable for 7mm CBD with gallbladder distention. \nGiven concern for gallstone pancreatitis, he was transferred to \n___ for ERCP. ERCP was attempted, however there was severe \nduodenitis making the procedure technically difficult. He was \nplaced on bowel rest to reattempt the procedure in a few days. \nDuring that time he was started on ciprofloxacin to reduce the \nrisk of developing infection. However, he had fevers, \nhypotension and worsening hyperbilirubinemia, likely due to \ndeveloping cholangitis. His creatinine also increased from 0.6 \nto 1.5, likely due to ATN in the setting of hypotension. \nAntibiotics were broadened to Zosyn. The following morning he \nwas brought for repeat ERCP, this time with successful stenting \nof the CBD with drainage of bile and pus. His symptoms quickly \nimproved, along with improvement in all of his laboratory \nvalues. He was weaned to ciprofloxacin to complete a 7 day \ncourse. His diet was advanced and he was tolerating a regular \ndiet at the time of discharge. He will follow up in ___ weeks \nfor stent removal. He was also seen by the surgical service \nduring this admission with recommendation for outpatient follow \nup to consider cholecystectomy after recovery from this current \nepisode.\n\n# ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:\nCreatinine increased to 1.5 from baseline 0.6. Urine lytes were \nnotable for a FeNa <0.1, however did not improve with aggressive \nvolume repletion. Muddy brown casts were seen in the urine \nsediment, making ATN the likely cause of his renal failure. The \nmost likely cause of ATN in this case would be hypotension in \nthe setting of cholangitis. Nephrotoxic medications were held \nand medications were renally dosed. The patient's renal function \nrecovered with a creatinine of 1.0 on the day of discharge.\n\n# ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE:\nPer patient's family he is alcohol dependent. However, he did \nnot require any diazepam during this admission and his CIWA \nscores were below 10. Alcohol cessation was advised.\n\n# DM2:\nOral hypoglycemics were held during this admission. He was \nmonitored using an insulin sliding scale.\n\n# ESSENTIAL HYPERTENSION:\nPatient's blood pressure was quite elevated in the setting of \nsevere pain initially and his home medications had been \ncontinued. However, in the setting of cholangitis he became \nhypotensive to \nthe ___ and had an increase in creatinine from 0.6 to 1.5. \nHis antihypertensives were held at that time. His blood pressure \nincreased to 140s\/80s so atenolol was restarted. Given that his \nsystolic blood pressure remained in 120s for the two days prior \nto discharge, he was not restarted on amlodipine, furosemide or \nlosartan. He was given clear instructions to check his blood \npressure at home and to notify his PCP if it were to become more \nelevated (or too low). The patient expressed understanding of \nthis plan. He will be scheduled to see his PCP for ___ blood \npressure and lab check and they can resume medications as \nindicated at that time.\n\n# GOUT: \nContinued allopurinol.\n\n# SYSTOLIC MURMUR:\nPer patient, this is an old finding. No cardiac symptoms, but \nrecommend outpatient TTE if this is actually a new finding or \nchange from prior.\n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\n[ ] All of patient's antihypertensives except atenolol were held \ndue to hypotension. He was clinically stable with blood \npressures in the 120s\/70s for the 2 days prior to discharge, so \nthey were not restarted. Please check his blood pressure at the \nnext visit and restart medications as indicated.\n[ ] Patient needs to have biliary stent removed in ___ weeks by \nERCP.\n[ ] Patient was instructed to hold Celebrex until having his \nlabs checked at the next visit.\n[ ] Please check CBC at next visit to ensure patient's anemia is \nstable.

CTA showed no \nintracranial vessel stenosis. MRI brain later showed no evidence \nof infarct. Of note, glucose >500 on admission and the patient \nspiked a fever to 103.2. \n\nGiven the metabolic and infectious causes of her symptoms, she \nwas transferred to the floor under the medicine service.\n\nShe was later found to have an HbA1c of 8.5% and her blood \ncultures from both the transfer hospital and ___ grew gram + \ncocci (staphylococcus, coagulase negative, ___ bottles at ___, \nsensitive to vancomycin). TTE showed no valvular abnormalities. \nHyperglycemia was controlled with an insulin sliding scale and \nshe started on metformin prior to discharge. And for the \nbacteremia, patient was started on a 14 day course of vancomycin \n(first day considered ___. Antibiotics were not narrowed \ndue to prior SJS while on Bactrim and Keflex. The patient's \nmental status returned to baseline following control of her \nblood sugars and treatment of her bacteremia. \n\n# Coag negative staph bacteremia: She presented with ___ SIRs \ncriteria including tachycardia and fever, with subsequent OSH \nand ___ blood cultures returning positive for coagulase \nnegative staphylococcus. Urine and serum toxicology negative \nupon arrival. TTE showed no valvular abnormalities. Patient \ndenied history of recent IV drug use and had no other recent \nhospitalizations. Culture indicates coag neg staphylococcus \nsensitive to oxacillin, however pt has history of SJS on Bactrim \nand Keflex; though reportedly likely due to Bactrim cannot rule \nout Keflex as cause therefore beta-lactams contraindicated by \nthis patient. Although source of coagulase-negative staph \ninfection was not clear, it was felt to be pathogenic since it \nappeared in multiple bottles and patient was acutely ill, \ntherefore patient continued on vancomycin (first day considered \n___ with plans for a 14-day course.\n\n# Diabetes Mellitus: Patient with hyperglycemia upon admission > \n500, now improved with insulin sliding scale. UA with \nglucosuria. Pt's BS continued to be range into 300s during \nadmission and HbA1c returned 8.5%. Patient was started on \nmetformin 500mg PO QD and Losartan 25mg PO QD. \n\n# Tachycardia: Patient with HRs in the 110s, baseline heart \nrates in the 100s per flowsheet review. Likely multifactorial \nincluding known sepsis with bacteremia vs opiate withdrawal. \nTachycardia improved with fluids. \n\n# Toxic Metabolic Encephalopathy: Patient originally presented \nwith altered mental status, aphasia, dysarthria, right arm\/leg \nsensory-motor deficits, with an NIHSS=10. CT head was negative \nfor acute bleed. She was initially given tPA empirically and \nmonitored in the ICU post-tPA. MRI subsequently negative for \nstroke. Her altered mental status most likely secondary to \nhyperglycemia and bacteremia. Given improvement in her mental \nstatus with treatment of her hyperglycemia, other causes such as \nthyroid derangements and B12 deficiency were considered, but \nwithin normal limits. Patient's initially noted focal deficits \n(aphasia, dysarthria, R arm\/leg deficits) improved following \nantibiotics and blood sugar control.\n\n# S\/P tPA: Patient originally presented with altered mental \nstatus, aphasia, dysarthria, right arm\/leg sensory-motor \ndeficits, with an NIHSS=10. CT head was negative for acute \nbleed. TPA bolus given at 2:02pm on ___ empirically. She \nwas monitored in the ICU post-tPA. Nabumatone 500 BID was held \nin the context of tPA but restarted upon discharge. \n\n# History of opiate abuse: Patient with a longstanding history \nof substance use, however, denies recent IV use. Serum and urine \ntoxicology negative on admission. Patient reported that she no \nlonger took methadone and weaned herself, and her ___ \nclinic at ___ (Dr. ___, ___ reported that \nshe is no longer a patient at the clinic.\n\n# Depression: Continued doxepin 25mg daily and gabapentin 300mg \nPO TID. After discussion with nursing home, confirmed that \npatient is not on mirtazapine or Seroquel previously documented, \nso these medications were stopped and not continued as \ndischarge.\n\n# HTN: Patient continued home diltiazem (home extended release \n180mg PO QD, inpatient 60mg PO TID). Blood pressure was kept \n120-180 for post-tPA care. She did not require any drips for \nblood pressure control.

Spinal \nlabeling has been provided on series 5, image 11 based on the \nlast costal process of the prior CT.  Note is made of \nsacralization of the L5 vertebral body.\n2. Moderate anterior wedge compression deformity of L1, is of \nindeterminate chronicity.\n3. Severe compression fracture with vertebral plana centrally of \nL2 and moderate retropulsed bowing of the posterior cortex in \nthe central canal,results in moderate canal narrowing.  This is \nalso of indeterminate chronicity, and an underlying neoplastic \nor inflammatory process cannot be excluded but appears less \nlikely.  No definite enhancement is seen.\n4.

She was seen by neurosurgery who recommended LSO \nbrace, which should be worn at all times. She was given vitamin \nD and Calcium. Would consider bisphosphonate as an outpatient.  \nThere were no signs to suggest a pathological etiology of this \nfracture, but would recommend bringing routine health preventive \nscreenings up to date.\n\n# Pleural effusion - Admission chest xray showed left moderate \npleural effusion that remained present on follow-up imaging.  \nThoracentesis yielded 800cc serous fluid consistent with \ntransudative etiology by Light's criteria.  Unclear etiology of \nthis effusion--she had a mildly elevated BNP, but no signs of \ndecompensated heart failure on remainder of exam or on history. \n Given splinting in setting of back pain, thought this could \npotentially be secondary to atelectasis.  Would consider repeat \nchest xray in ___ weeks to look for recurrence--if does recur \ncould consider cardiac workup (e.g. TTE). \n\n# Acute bacterial UTI: Patient presented with several days of \nurinary frequency, found to have a UA concerning for UTI.  \nUrine culture grew e. coli and proteus sensitive to Bactrim. \nShe initially received IV ceftriaxone and then was transitioned \nto PO Bactrim.  She will be discharged on Bactrim DS BID for 1 \nday to finish seven day course of antibiotics.\n\n# R thigh pseudotumor and hematoma: after multiple R hip \nreplacement revisions, most recently ___. Per ortho, \ncurrent imaging most suggestive of seroma. Given asymptomatic, \northopedics recommeded against any intervention.  Patient \nreports leg pain is at baseline.  Her anticoagulation was \ncontinued. \n\nCHRONIC ISSUES:  \n=====================================\n#HLD: previously was on simvastatin but this was held last \nhospital course due to interaction with diltiazem.

EKG showed no significant changes from \n___ EKG. He was administered sublingual nitroglycerin x3 and \nhis pain improved; however the pressure persisted. The patient \nwas admitted to rule out myocardial infarction. 3 sets of \ncardiac enzymes were negative. He believes the chest pressure \nsensation is almost always there. His metoprolol was increased \nfrom Toprol-XL 25mg per day to metoprolol succinate 25mg PO \nthree times daily. His isosorbide dinitrate was increased from \n20 mg BID to 30 mg BID for symptomatic improvement. Aspirin was \ncontinued. His vital signs remained stable with the exception of \nintermittent elevated heart rate as described below (see \nParoxysmal atrial fibrillation\/supraventricular tacyhcardia \nbelow).\nHis chest pain was most likely secondary to stable angina or \ndemand secondary to SVT. It could also be related to his \npneumonia (discussed below).\n\n2) ___\nIn the emergency department, a chest x-ray showed a retrocardiac \nopacity with small bilateral pleural effusions. His WBC count \nwas 8.1 with 84.6% neutrophils. He remained afebrile during his \nadmission. On ___, he was started on a 10-day course of \nlevofloxacin and vancomycin to treat hospital acquired pneumonia \n(as his presumed infection was likely acquired at his assisted \nliving facility).

Etiology is \nunclear, and patient maintained hemodynamic stability during \nepisodes.\nA possible precipitant is his underlying pneumonia. CHADS2 = ___ \n(unclear if he has had a stroke in the past). To investigate \npossible causes of his atrial fibrillation, TSH was checked; it \nwas mildly elevated, as described below (Follow up). TTE showed \nmild left atrial enlargement with ___ MR. ___ 50-55%.\n\n4) Renal failure\nThe patient's creatinine level was maintained at or below his \nbaseline of 1.6-1.8.

The \ncontour of the \nliver is smooth. There is 2 hyperechoic liver nodules, the first \nin segment 8 \nmeasuring 6 x 4 x 4 mm, the second in segment ___ measuring 1.5 \nx 1.1 x 1.1 \ncm.  These are consistent with hemangiomas, however given the \nunderlying liver \ndisease close attention on follow-up is recommended.  This could \nbe performed \nin 3 months time.  Alternatively, further characterization with \nMRI could be \nperformed.  No other concerning liver lesions identified.. The \nmain portal \nvein is patent with hepatopetal flow. There is no ascites. \n  \nBILE DUCTS: There is no intrahepatic biliary dilation. The CBD \nmeasures 4 mm. \n  \nGALLBLADDER: There is no evidence of stones or gallbladder wall \nthickening. \n  \nPANCREAS: Imaged portion of the pancreas appears within normal \nlimits, without \nmasses or pancreatic ductal dilation, with portions of the \npancreatic tail \nobscured by overlying bowel gas. \n  \nSPLEEN: Normal echogenicity, measuring 16.1 cm. \n  \nKIDNEYS: The right kidney measures 12.7 cm. The left kidney \nmeasures 12.8 cm. \nNormal cortical echogenicity and corticomedullary \ndifferentiation is seen \nbilaterally. There is no evidence of masses, stones, or \nhydronephrosis in the \nkidneys. \n  \nRETROPERITONEUM: Visualized portions of aorta and IVC are within \nnormal \nlimits. \n  \nIMPRESSION:  \n  \n2 hyperechoic liver lesions measuring 6 x 4 x 4 mm and 1.5 x 1.1 \nx 1.1 cm in \nsegments 8 and ___ respectively, as detailed above.  Although \nthese are likely \nhemangiomas, either close 3 month follow-up or further \ncharacterization with \nMRI is recommended given the underlying liver disease. \n  \nModerate splenomegaly with the spleen measuring 16.1 cm. \n  \nRECOMMENDATION(S):  Close interval left 3 month follow-up with \nultrasound or \nfurther characterization with MRI as described above. \n\nEXAMINATION:  CT CHEST W\/CONTRAST \n  \nINDICATION:  ___ year old man with hx iv drug use, hcap\/flu, on \nvanc\/cefepime, \npersistent o2 requirement, admitting to recent K2\/spice use, got \n8 L IVF in \nICU  \/\/ r\/o HSP vs pulmonary edema vs multilobar pneumonia \n  \nTECHNIQUE:   Multi detector helical scanning of the chest was \ncoordinated with \nintravenous infusion of nonionic iodinated contrast agent and \nreconstructed as \n5 and 1.25 mm thick axial, 2.5 mm thick coronal and \nparasagittal, and 8 mm MIP \naxial images.

Study \nis read in \nconjunction with chest radiograph ___. \n  \n  \nFINDINGS:  \n  \nSupraclavicular and axillary lymph nodes are not not enlarged.  \nThere is no \nsoft tissue abnormality in the chest wall suspicious for \nmalignancy or \ninfection.  This study is not appropriate for subdiaphragmatic \ndiagnosis. \n  \nThyroid is unremarkable.  Thymus is edematous and mildly \nenlarged, but not \nmass like. \n  \nAtherosclerotic calcification is not apparent head neck or \ncoronary arteries.  \nMediastinal and hilar lymph nodes are numerous, but not \npathologically \nenlarged, presumably reactive.  Aorta is normal size, but \nbiventricular \ncardiomegaly and dilated pulmonary arteries are best evaluated \nwith dedicated \ncardiac imaging.  No filling defects are seen in the central \npulmonary \narteries. \n  \nSmall nonhemorrhagic right pleural effusion is mostly fissural.  \nLeft pleural \neffusion is minimal.  There is no pericardial effusion. \n  \nWidespread pulmonary consolidation is severe.  The right lower \nlobe is almost \nentirely airless ; the left lower lobe is heterogeneously \nconsolidated in the \nsuperior segment and the basal segments are nearly airless.  The \nattenuation \nof both lower lobes, 25 ___, is lower than that generally seen \nwith atelectasis \nand suggests pneumonia except that this is a young patient whose \nhypoxic vaso \nconstriction may decrease pulmonary blood flow more efficient \nwith only see in \nolder patients.  Nevertheless there is sufficient the \nconsolidation in the \nupper lobes to suggest widespread pneumonia. \n  \nPeribronchovascular ground-glass opacification also prominent in \nthe upper \nlobes suggests a different process, sensitivity or toxicity. \n  \nThere no bone lesions in the chest cage suggesting infection or \nmalignancy. \n  \n  \nIMPRESSION:  \n  \nSevere nearly global bibasilar consolidation could be pneumonia \nor pneumonia \nwith substantial atelectasis.  Multi focal pneumonia elsewhere, \npredominantly \ndependent upper lobes. \n  \nWidespread peribronchovascular edema or pneumonitis could be due \nto diffuse \nalveolar damage from widespread pneumonia or toxic inhalation.  \nThis is less \nlikely pulmonary hemorrhage alone because of its symmetric \ndistribution. \n  \nSmall nonhemorrhagic pleural effusions, not concerning for \ninfection. \n  \nBiventricular cardiomegaly and probable pulmonary arterial \nhypertension.  \nEchocardiography recommended. \n  \nMild reactive central adenopathy. \n  \nRECOMMENDATION(S):  Echocardiography. \n\nECHO ___\n\nThe left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall \nthickness, cavity size and regional\/global systolic function are \nnormal (LVEF = 65%). Right ventricular chamber size and free \nwall motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the \nsinus level. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally \nnormal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or \naortic regurgitation. There is mild posterior leaflet mitral \nvalve prolapse. There is no pericardial effusion. \n\n IMPRESSION: no vegetations seen\n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ hx IVDU p\/w fevers, hypoxemic respiratory failure. \nAttributed to influenza A and multifocal bacterial PNA. Admitted \nto MICU for hypoxia, and had prolonged course notable for \nhypoxia ___ severe pneumonia and atelectasis.

Patient discharged on levofloxacin abx regimen to \nend ___, and finished 5 day azithromycin and oseltamivir \ncourses in house. \n\nOf note, patient was discharged late ___ as he insisted he had \nto make a meeting the following morning. We emphasized risks of \nleaving to patient, as medical team determined patient should \nstay in house one more day to see response to oral antibiotics. \nMedical team implored to patient to return if he had worsening \nSOB, fevers, or any other symptoms that concerned him. \n\n# Influenza with superimposed bacterial pneumonia: FluA + with \nCXR showing multifocal pneumonia. Caused hypoxemic respiratory \nfailure, still on 3L O2 NC by time to transfer to floor.  \nPersistent hypoxia was thought to be volume overload positive 7 \nL after 24 hr ICU stay versus possible K2 use (patient reports \nusing K2\/spice - synthetic marijuana equivalent which he \ninhaled). Ct chest ___ concerning for GGO's, but alveolar \nhemorrhage lower on differential as patient has decreasing \nhemoptysis and stable hgb.

EKGs from ___ showed T-wave inversions in I, \naVL, and V1-V6 that were concerning for ischemia (although the \npatient was completely asymptomatic at the the time).  Patient \nwas started on a heparin drip and her aspirin was increased to \n325 mg daily, with initial plan for cardiac catheterization.  \nHowever patient's symptoms resolved with diuresis, and in light \nof the fact that patient's previous catheterization in ___ \nshowed normal coronaries, no cardiac catheterization was \npursued.  Carvedilol, simvastatin, and valsartan were continued. \n Warfarin was initally held for possibility of cardiac \ncatheterization, but recontinued at patient's home dose upon \ndischarge.\n.\n# PUMP\/Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure: The patient \npresented in respiratory distress requiring non-invasive \nventillation, but she improved rapidly with furosemide and \nnitroglycerin.  Within less than 24 hours, the patient was \nbreathing comfortably on room air, with oxygen saturations in \nthe upper ___. The etiology of the patient's CHF exacerbation \nwas unclear, but was recently decreased from furosemide 40mg to \n20mg. It was hypothesized that the patient may have briefly gone \ninto atrial fibrillation. Dietary indiscretion during ___ \n___ may also have been a contributing factor. Pulmonary embolism \nwas ruled out CTA. Cardiac enzymes were negative, although EKG \nshowed diffuse T-wave changes in the lateral and pre-cordial \nleads.  The patient was discharged on home on furosemide 40mg \ndaily.  She will follow up with Dr. ___ in cardiology \nclinic, the clinic will contact her with date and time of \nappointment.  Patient is also scheduled for an outpatient \nnuclear stress test on ___ at 8:40AM\n.\n# RHYTHM: The patient remained in sinus rhythm, although it was \nhypothesized that she may have had a brief episode of atrial \nfibrillation prior to presentation.\n.\n# Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: The patient is s\/p pulmonary \nvein isolation x 2. She was monitored on telemetry and remained \nin sinus rhythm. As noted above, it was thought that a brief \nepisode of atrial fibrillation could have triggered the \npatient's presenting shortness of breath. Amiodarone was \ncontinued. Warfarin was recontinued on discharge at her home \ndosage.\n.\n# ? Community-acquired pneumonia: The patient's presentation was \nthought to be more consistent with congestive heart failure than \npneumonia.

Also with discitis, osteomyelitis. \nSevere cord compression with edema extending from T8-T11\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nMr. ___ is a ___ y.o. man with Stage IV COPD CAD s\/p CABG, CHF \nadmitted to OSH with COPD flare, his course was complicated by \nhypercarbic respiratory failure and lower extremity paralysis \nwith cord compression and paraspinal abscess now ___ s\/p \nsurgical debridement and fusion, course complicated by transient \nepisodes of complete AV block, poor systolic function, \nrespiratory failure x 2 requiring intubation, and hypotension \nrequiring pressors. His respiratory failure has resolved, his \nhypotension is resolved on midodrine, but he has persistent ___ \nparalysis secondary to paraspinal abscess\/cord compression. \n\nActive Issues\n\n#)Respiratory failure: \nPer OSH, pt had COPD exacerbation leading to hypercarbic \nrespiratory failure and intubation and uneventful extubation.  \nHe did experience dyspnea ___ excess secretions and atelectasis. \n Required ipratopium and saline nebs.  He was extubated and did \nwell enough to transfer from the MICU to the floor. However, he \nbegan having respiratory distress and poor blood gases \nnecessitating transfer back to the MICU, where he was intubated \nand put on pressure support. He became hypotensive and \ntachycardic in this setting, likely b\/c he was put on pressure \nsupport b\/c of concern for an ARDS picture. He was switched to \nCMV, and his hypotension became less profound, and his \nrespiratory status improved. He was able to have sedation \nreduced the ___ day of his intubation (___). On ___, he was \nable to have a successful spontaneous breathing trial, a RSBI \n45, had O2 sats in the ___, and was arousable but not able to \nclear secretions. He did well on CPAP, but extubation was held \noff due to his inability to clear secretions. On ___ he became \nmore alert, again passed an SBT, and had a RSBI<100. He was \ngiven a trial of extubation since he was felt to be about as \ngood as he will be re: mental status. He passed this trial and \nwas able to be weaned down to 4L NC over the next few days w\/o \nhaving acute respiratory distress. Oxygen should be weaned as \ntolerated for goal sat >90%.\n\n# Hypotension: \nThis is the result of multifactorial processes: poor systolic \nfunction + neurogenic hypotension + sepsis + sedation.  Also has \nbaseline orthostatic hypotension for which he was on \nfludrocortisone prior to admission.  During his initial MICU \nstay, he required IVF and pressor support and was successfully \nweaned off after he was restarted on fludrocortisone at an \nincreased dose of daily instead of every other day.  However, he \nagain became hypotensive in the setting of pressure-support \nventilation and an NSTEMI.  He maxed out on levophed and was \nplaced on phenylephrine as well. When his ventilator settings \nwere changed to CMV, he was able to be weaned off levophed \nalthoug he remained on phenylephrine even after his MAP \ntitration floor was changed to <55. He also had elevated \ntroponins and was diagnosed w\/ an NSTEMI in this repeat setting \nof hypotension, so the NSTEMI may have contributed to his \nhypotension by worsening his systolic function, although his \nLVEF remained at 35% on f\/u Echo. He was able to be weaned off \nphenylephrine after extubation and was transitioned to PO \nmidodrine for blood pressure support.  He has follow-up with his \ncardiologist ___. \n\n# Epidural abscess and T9 osteomyelitis s\/p debridement and \nfusion: \nPt presented with cord compression and lower extremity flaccid \nparalysis ___ epidural abscess and osteomyelitis.  After \nsurgical debridement ___, he was empirically covered with \nvancomycin and ceftriaxone and flagyl. Epidural abscess cultures \nrevealed Gram+ cocci. Likely source was sacral decubitus ulcer.  \nID on board and advised to continue vancomycin for 6 weeks since \nthe tissue grew Strep viridans but after sensitivities returned \nchanged the antibiotic to ceftriaxone. Antibiotics should \ncontinue until ___. He will follow-up with Dr. ___ \n___ of orthopedics in ~4weeks and will follow up at ___ \nclinic as well.  Weekly labs should be faxed to infectious \ndisease RNs with ESR, CRP and CBC\/diff checked weekly.\n\n#NSTEMI: \nIn the setting of his hypotension upon his second transfer to \nthe MICU on ___, he was found to have elevated troponins for \nwhich he was started on heparin gtt, atorvastatin 80 mg, and ASA \n325 for NSTEMI. His troponins trended down ___, so heparin gtt \nwas discontinued. A TTE, which was poor quality, was performed \n___ which revealed LVEF 35%, moderate LV dilated systolic \ndysfunction hypokinesis w\/ distal ___ of ventricle having \nhypokinesis, nl R chamber, no AR\/MR, and no effusions.  A \nsubsequent TEE was similar to the TTE. He was started on \nclopidogrel 75 mg PO daily as well in this setting after being \ncleared by ortho to do so. He has follow-up with his \ncardiologist Dr. ___ on ___, at this appointment \nanticoagulation for LV aneurysm should be considered but was \ndeferred during hospitalization given comorbidities and recent \nsurgery.\n \n#Complete AV Block \/ Tachycardia-Bradycardia syndrome: \nPt had 2 episodes of bradycardia with complete AV block which \nrequired atropine and pressors to break during initial MICU \nstay.  Per cardiology and EP, a pacemaker is likely to be \nrequired after his acute osteomyelitis has resolved and \nantibiotics course completed. AV nodal blocking drugs have been \nheld. Given continued concern for possible cardiac vegetations \nor complication such as abscess, a TEE was performed ___, which \nrevealed no cardiac vegetations or clinically significant \nvalvular disease.  He has follow-up with his cardiologist Dr. \n___ on ___ at which time a pacemaker should be considered. \n\n#Renal Failure:\nHis baseline Cr 1.0. He developed renal failure where his Cr \ndoubled to 2.2 from ___ to ___ following his episode of \nhypotension and NSTEMI, so this was likely pre-renal in nature. \nHis Cr stayed around 2.0 a week after this event, so this may be \nhis new baseline.  Cr on discharge 1.9\n\n#Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation: Patient was not on \nanticoagulation prior to admission and given setting of recent \nsurgery was not started while in MICU.  Should follow up on this \nissue at his cardiology visit.\n\n#Delirium:\nOn the ___ MICU admission, he exhibited waxing and waning mental \nstatus with some agitation before transfer to the general floor. \n Seroquel 25 mg x 2 was given without benefit.  He received \nHaldol 1mg IM, which improved without significant increase in \nQTC.  On the ___ MICU admission, he was started on seroquel 25 \nmg TID to help address his agitation. He did require haldol 6 mg \nIV during his second MICU stay due to acute agitation. On \ndischarge he was confused but not agitated and continued on \nseroquel 25 mg TID. The need for continued antipsychotics should \nbe reassessed after discharge to extended care.\n\n# Sacral Decubitus Ulcer: \nThis was an issue which the ACS service was monitoring. This \nulcer has not been improving per nursing, wound care, and ACS. \nSantyl (collagenase) enzymatic debridement was started to help \naddress this. \n\nChronic Issues\n\n#Pulmonary HTN: Stable, not on medications for this and was \ncontinued on supplmental O2.\n\n# Chronic systolic heart failure: \nEF 35% per report from ___. Lasix was originally held in \nthe setting of hypotension, but this was restarted since Mr. \n___ was several liters positive during the hospitalization. His \nmetoprolol was held throughout his hospitalization given his \ncomplete heart block. He was discharged on lasix 80 mg in AM and \n40 mg in ___ which was his home regimen, but volume status should \nbe reassessed and dose may be increased if patient gains more \nthan 3 lbs in one day or concern for hypervolemia.\n  \n# CAD: \n4-Vessel CABG in ___ at ___. His ASA and simvastatin were \nincreased to ASA 325 and atorvastatin 80 mg for NSTEMI.\n   \n# Hypothyroidism: \nStable, continued outpt meds.\n\n# Diabetes Mellitus: \nHis blood glucose levels remained below 240 on SSI and below 150 \nthe last few days of his hospitalization. He was continued on an \nISS as an outpatient.   \n\nTransitional Issues\n- reassess need for antipsychotics, mental status may be \nimproving and may not have long-term need\n- assess volume status daily and daily weights, consider \nincreasing lasix dose if weight increasing or appears \nhypervolemic\n- consider pacemaker placement for heart block and \nanticoagulation for both paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and LV \naneurysm at cardiology followup visit \n- Continue ceftriaxone 2 gm daily until ___ and weekly \nCBC\/diff and ESR\/CRP to be faxed to infectious disease nurses at \n___\n#Full code as per HCP, nephew, ___ ___.\n \nMedications on Admission:\nPreadmissions medications listed are incomplete and require \nfuther investigation.

No acute fracture. \n.\nCXR: Cardiomegaly, no acute intrathoracic process\n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nThe patient is a ___ yo woman with h\/o AFib on Coumadin with \nsupratherapeutic INR, CHF, CKD, and gout, who presents with \nhematuria and right wrist, finger pain, and ankle pain, \nconcerning for a gout flair.  \n\n#. Gout Flair:  The patient states that the wrist pain has been \npresent for 4 days, and it feels similar to her previous flares \nof gout.  She was seen by orthopedic surgery in the ED, and she \nhad a wrist XRay, which was negative.  She was afebrile and did \nnot have a leukocytosis, her uric acid was elevated at 12.8, and \nshe had a previously confirmed episode of gout, so gout flair \nwas thought to be the most likely etiology.  She was initially \nstarted on colchicine, as indomethacin was contraindicated given \nher acute on chronic renal failure, but her pain did not \nimprove.  She then developed right ankle pain, so Rheumatology \nwas consulted, and she was started on Prednisone.  She should \ncontinue on Colchicine daily and Prednisone for an eight day \ntaper.  Furthermore, she was scheduled to see Dr. ___ in \nRheumatology for follow-up in one week.\n\n# Hematuria: The patient reports gross hematuria, which started \nthree days prior to admission.  She denied dysuria, flank pain, \nor CVA tenderness, and a straight-cath U\/A confirmed gross \nhematuria.  Her U\/A did not show evidence of RBC casts, and \nrenal U\/S was negative for any obvious massess in the kidney.  \nShe was treated with Cipro for a presumptive UTI, pending her \nurine culture, and she was scheduled for an outpatient follow-up \nwith urology for likely cystoscopy.  Of note, she did have urine \ncytology sent on this admission, the results of which are still \npending. \n  \n#. Chronic Renal Failure:  The patient's creatinine on admission \nwas 2.2, which is consistent with her baseline since ___.  \nHer medications were renally dose, and her creatinine on \ndischarge was 1.9.\n\n# Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a history of AFib, and \nshe was tachycardic during this admission to the low 100s.  She \nwas continued on her home dose of Metoprolol 50 mg PO BID, and \nthis was not able to be increased, as her SBP was also in the \nlow 100s.  Her INR was also elevated on admission to 4.3, so her \ncoumadin was held during this admission, and it was restarted \nwhen her creatinine decreased to 1.8.  She was discharged on \nMetoprolol 50 mg PO BID and a decreased dose of Coumadin (1 mg \n___ and 2 mg ___.\n\n# Hypertension:  The patient has a history of hypertension, for \nwhich she takes Spironolactone and Metoprolol at home.  Her \nsystolic blood pressure was consistently in the low 100s during \nthis admission, so she was continued on her home dose of \nMetoprolol 50 mg BID and Sprionolactone 12.5 mg daily.  \n  \n# Chronic diastolic dysfunction (EF 55%):  On admission, the \npatient had minimal crackles at her bases bilaterally.  She was \nrestarted on her home dose of Torsemide and Spironolactone \ndaily, and her respiratory status improved.  She was thus \ndischarged on her home regimen.  \n\n_______________________________\nPLEASE FOLLOW UP:\nUrine Cytology\n \nMedications on Admission:\nMetoprolol tartrate 150 mg PO QAM and 100 mg PO QPM (** 50 mg \nBID per call-in)  \nWarfarin 1 mg PO Q ___  \nWarfarin 2 mg PO Q ___  \nSpironolactone 12.5 mg PO DAILY  \nLevothyroxine 50 mcg PO DAILY  \nPolyethylene glycol 3350 17 g PO DAILY  \nSenna 8.6 mg PO DAILY  \nDocusate sodium 100 mg PO BID  \nSimvastatin 40 mg PO DAILY  \nTorsemide 20 mg PO BID (** 40 mg qAM and 20 mg qPM)  \nLidocaine ointment  \nCalcium 600 mg BID  \nMaxidex 0.1% 1 gtt ___ HS  \nVitamin D3 1000 IU daily  \nTramadol 50 mg tablets, ___ tablet q 6 hours PRN  \n\n \nDischarge Medications:\n1. metoprolol tartrate 50 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID \n(2 times a day).\nDisp:*60 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*\n2. warfarin 1 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day. \nTablet(s) \n3. warfarin 2 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO 2 days\/week \n(___).  \n4. spironolactone 25 mg Tablet Sig: 0.5 Tablet PO DAILY (Daily). \n \n5. levothyroxine 50 mcg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY \n(Daily).  \n6. polyethylene glycol 3350 17 gram\/dose Powder Sig: One (1) \npacket PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.  \n7. senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day as \nneeded for constipation.  \n8. docusate sodium 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO BID (2 \ntimes a day).  \n9. simvastatin 40 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY \n(Daily).  \n10. torsemide 20 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO QAM (once a \nday (in the morning)).\nDisp:*60 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*\n11. torsemide 20 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO QPM (once a \nday (in the evening)).\nDisp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*\n12.

Patent hepatic vasculature. \n2. Cholelithiasis without gallbladder wall thickening. \n3. Splenomegaly. \n4. Small ascites. \n  \nECHO ___\nThe left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial \npressure is ___ mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular \nhypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function \n(LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall \nmotion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The estimated \ncardiac index is normal (>=2.5L\/min\/m2). Right ventricular \nchamber size and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of \naorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The \naortic valve leaflets (?#) appear structurally normal with good \nleaflet excursion. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic \nregurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally \nnormal with trivial mitral regurgitation. The pulmonary artery \nsystolic pressure could not be determined. There is no \npericardial effusion. \n\nIMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mild symmetric left \nventricular hypertrophy with preserved global biventricular \nsystolic function.\n\nXRAY RIGHT ELBOW ___\nFINDINGS\nThere are soft tissue changes and presumed edema along the \nmedial aspect of the elbow.  No fracture, bone destruction, or \nother osseous abnormality.  I doubt the presence of an effusion. \n Normal mineralization.\n \nIMPRESSION: Normal osseous structures.\n\nXRAY RIGHT WRIST ___\nFINDINGS:\nNo fracture or bone destruction.  Minimal degenerative changes \nfirst see IMC joint with no joint space narrowing here or \nelsewhere.  Soft tissue changes probably reflect a bandage over \nthe distal forearm and wrist.  Equivocal incidental slight \npositive ulnar variance.  Vascular calcifications are\nnoteworthy in this age group. Normal mineralization.\n \nIMPRESSION:\nNo fracture. Vasculopathy\n\nRUE U\/S ___\nIMPRESSION: No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in the right \nupper extremity. There is a small thrombosed superficial vein \nnoted in the right forearm.  Superficial edema is also noted in \nthe right forearm.\n\n___ MRI: Findings suggesting myonecrosis involving the \nvolar compartment musculature of the forearm with areas of \nhemorrhage and diffuse subcutaneous soft tissue edema. Infection \nis not excluded, however is considered less likely.\n\n___ RUE US: Complex heterogeneous collection in the volar \naspect of the right forearm corresponds to the area of \nmyonecrosis with areas of hemorrhage and overlying subcutaneous \nedema as seen on the prior MR examination performed 1 day prior. \nNot amenable to percutaneous drainage.\n\n___ CT RUE: IMPRESSION (prelim): Skin thickening and \nsuperficial soft tissue fat stranding of mainly the ventral soft \ntissues of the right upper extremity starting from the level of \nthe mid humerus to the wrist suggestive of cellulitis. No fluid \ncollection, subcutaneous gas or bony erosions. \n \n \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nMr. ___ is a ___ year old gentleman with HCV s\/p inteferon \ntreatment with relapse, c\/b cryoglobulinemia, leukocytoclastic \nvasculitis with MPGN, pulmonary hemorrhage treated with \nplasmapharesis (___), chronic anasarca, dCHF (EF 55%), IDDM, \nmorbid obesity, COPD, CAD who presents with volume overload, \nhyperkalemia, and worsening creatinine.\n\nACTIVE ISSUES:\n# ___:  Unclear etiology.  Possibly related to pre-exisiting \ncryoglobulinemia or vasculitis however urine protein \ninconsistent with MPGN.  Patient responded to lasix and given \nhyponatremia, may be prerenal picture.  Although patient's MELD \n24, driven by creatinine (falsely elevated). Synthetic function \ngood making HRS less likely etiology. Patient continued on lasix \n120 mg BID with goal of ___ L\/day out. Renal ultrasound showed \nno evidence of hydronephrosis and a small amount of ascites.  \nUltimately patient's diuresis to Lasix and Metolazone was \nminimal.  A tunneled HD line was placed and patient began HD \n(with the goal of 2L fluid removal daily).  He tolerated this \nwell.  An ECHO showed over all preserved biventricular function \nso heart failure was not thought to be a contributing factor.  \nThe patient was on a long Prednisone taper for his \ncryoglobulinemia and on 40mg was not showing improving renal \nfunction and was having uncontrollable hyperglycemia.  He was \ntapered down to Prednisone 20mg daily which he tolerated well. \nRenal team recommended re-initiation of diuretics while patient \nwas on HD as he was still having urine output so started \nTorsemide 80mg daily. He will continue on a ___ HD schedule \nas an outpatient. \n\n# Right forearm pain:  Patient initially mentioned some right \nforearm pain in setting of pulling himself up in the bed, \nattributing it to muscle strain.  His exam was overall benign \nwhen the pain was first noticed.  He had a CK that was normal.  \nPatient continued to complain of severe pain, out of proportion \nto exam which was minimally controlled with Oxycodone and \nTylenol.  He had plain films that showed no fracture and no \nosteoporosis.  He underwent an U\/S to rule out DVT.  By U\/S a \nsmall thrombosed superficial vein was noted but no DVT.  His \nexam progressed to have soft tissue swelling around the elbow \nand forearm as well as warmth.  There was some mild erythema \nnoted but given his baseline skin breakdown and ecchymoses, it \nwas difficult to differentiate.  He had MRI which showed \nfindings concerning for myonecrosis and deep tissue infection.  \nOrthopedic surgery was consulted as was Rheumatology and \nInfectious disease. Considered the possibility that patient had \ncryoglobulins contributing to the myonecrosis but Rheumatology \nthought very unlikely. They also considered diabetic myonectoris \nunlikely as well. Orthopedic surgery did not see any indication \nfor intervention at time of consult.  Patient was started on \nbroad spectrum antibiotics (Vanc, Zosyn and Clindamyin) and \nblood cultures were drawn. Given rapid progression of his \nsymptoms further imaging was performed. MRI revealed evidence of \nmyonecrosis. CT scan was negative for gas formation or abscess. \nHis exam was monitored closely and improved with antibiotics. \nDespite counseling regarding the need to monitor his symptoms \nand exam on PO antibiotics prior to discharge home, he did not \nwant to stay in-house beyond ___. He received 2 days of IV \nantibiotics and is discharged on Bactrim and Keflex. He will \ntake Keflex to complete a ___nd will continue to \ntake Bactrim for PCP prophylaxis as below.   \n\n#AMS: Patient had poor concentration on presentation. Head CT \nwas negative.  Hepatic encephalopathy unlikely given that \npatient's synthetic function was okay. Patient was continued on \nlactulose and rifaximin for possible hepatic encephalopathy. \nMental status for duration of hospitalization was largely at \nbaseline though patient experienced significant fatigue with \ninitiation of HD and pain medications for above issue.\n\n# Cirrhosis: Child ___ class B, due to hepatitis C (gen. 1b) \ns\/p failed treatment with IFN. Given multiple complications \nrelated to cryoglobulinemia attempted to initiate sofosbuvir and \nsimeprivir however denied by insurance on multiple attempts. \nDecompensated with hepatic encephalopathy and ascites, no report \nof bleeding varices or SBP in the past. MELD currently 21 but \nfalsely elevated due to creatine. Patient should get EGD as \noutpatient. Patient's U\/S on admission showed normal liver and \npatent hepatic vasculature, splenomegaly, and Small ascites. \n  \n# Cryoglobulinemia: Complications include leukocytoclastic \nvasculitis, CKD as above, and pulmonary hemorrhage (___) \ntreated with high dose steroids and plasmapharesis in the past \nthough had seizure on plasmaphereisis. He was continued on a \nprednisone taper and at discharge was on 20mg daily to continue \nlong taper per his outpatient nephrologist. He is discharged on \nBactrim for PCP prophylaxis and ___ continue taking this until \nhe completes the prednisone taper per his outpatient \nnephrologist. \n\n# Diabetes: During this admission he had uncontrolled \nhyperglycemia with blood sugars to >500 and a widening anion \ngap. He briefly required an insulin gtt for glycemic control and \n___ was consulted. Given his worsening renal function, his \ncryoglobulinemia was not thought to be very responsive to \nsteroid treatment and in the setting of hyperglycemia, his \nPrednisone dose was reduced. His insulin regimen was adjusted \nand NPH was added to assist with coverage. He prefers to follow \nup with his outpatient endocrinologist for further management \nrather than at ___ as he has been with him for several years.\n\n# Hyponatremia: Most likely hypervolemic hyponatremia.  Improved \nwith diuresis\/HD. Patient was put on fluid restriction of 1500mL \ndaily.\n\nCHRONIC ISSUES:\n#Anemia:  H\/H on admission ___.7\/___.1.  Patient also had bruising \non exam (platelets 122) most likely due to poor platelet \nfunction in setting of elevated BUN.  Overall this remained \nstable and worsening renal failure is likely a contributing \nfactor.  No evidence of bleeding this admission.\n \n# Seizure disorder: New onset last hospitalization in setting of \nplasmapharesis, MRI with right frontal lobe lesion and chronic \nsmall vessel disease ?___ cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. He was \ncontinued on keppra and should follow with neuro as an \noutpatient.   \n  \n# Chronic pain: given MS changes with MS contin this was \nrecently changed to oxycodone which was continued this \nadmission.  He additionally required small prn doses of Dilaudid \nin setting of acute arm pain as above. \n\n# HTN: Held vasodilators until HRS ruled out  \n\n# CAD: Unrevascularized as per prior records. He continued \nAspirin 81mg daily and Atorvastatin 80mg daily. \n \n# BPH: Patient's Tamsulosin was held in setting of initiation of \nHD and worsening renal function.\n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\n- He will have outpatient HD on ___ schedule\n- He is discharged on Bactrim\/Keflex for cellulitis to complete \na 10 day course of Keflex THROUGH ___\n- He should continue on Bactrim for PCP prophylaxis while he is \non prednisone\n- He will follow up with his nephrologist for prednisone taper\n- He is discharged on Torsemide per renal recs\n- He will follow up with Dr. ___ primary endocrinologist, \nfor further management of his diabetes\n- He will be scheduled for follow up with Dr. ___ in the GI \nclinic\n- ___ as outpatient\n\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

NIHSS in ED \nwas 2. STAT CT head and CTA head\/neck were performed; there was \nno evidence of stroke on the CT head and there was no evidence \nof flow-limiting stenosis, or large-vessel occlusion on CTA. No \ntPA was given due to his low NIHSS and unknown time of symptom \nonset. He was admitted for further stroke work-up. An MRI of his \nhead was performed and showed no evidence of acute infarct. His \nHbA1c was 5.5 and fasting lipid panel showed Chol 185 Trigs 121 \nHDL 29 and LDL 132. A TTE was performed to complete the stroke \nevaluation; there was no evidence of ASD or PFO, LVEF 55%. He \ncontinued to have a mild right facial droop and right pronator \ndrift during his hospitalization, so it is possible that this is \nhis baseline. He had no acute stroke, though it is possible he \nhad a TIA if he did have worsening of these symptoms prior to \nadmission. An EEG was also performed to evaluate for signs of \nseizure activity as a possible explanation of his symptoms on \npresentation; this showed left frontal and bifrontal theta \nfrequency slowing in bursts, but no epileptiform discharges or \nelectrographic seizures.\n\nID: Mr. ___ began spiking intermittent high grade fevers up \nto 103. Infectious work-up was sent and blood cultures ended up \nbeing positive for Coag Negative Staph. He had a TEE for \nevaluation of endocarditis. There was no evidence of vegetations \non TEE. He was started on Vancomycin as empiric treatment for \nhis positive blood cultures. He ended up having ___ blood \ncultures positive for Coag Negative Staph. He was seen by ID, \nwho recommended completion of 2 week course of Vancomycin 1 gram \nIV q12h for possible skin and soft tissue infection with \npositive blood cultures and no evidence of endocarditis. They \nrecommended considering the start of the 2 week ___ at time of \nfirst negative blood culture on ___, with course being completed \non ___. While inpatient, he was also receiving nystatin powder \nto groin for candidal skin\ninfection.   \n\nGI: On a CXR that was performed as part of his fever workup, \nthere was mild dilatation of bowel loops noted that was \nconsistent with an adynamic ileus. An Abdominal X-ray was \nperformed to further evaluate and this showed a focal large \nbowel ileus.

The differential for these was broad, but was primarily \nconcerning for malignancy or granulomatous disease.  He had been \nundergoing outpatient workup for his thoracic lymphadenopathy, \nso imaging was deferred to that setting in consultation with his \nPulmonologist.  Multiple labs were ordered (as detailed \nseparately), none of which were suggestive for a particular \nprocess.  His headache and back pain resolved shortly after \nadmission, as did his chest pain, which was ruled out for acute \nintrathoracic process by EKG, CTA, and serial troponins.  Given \nthe resolution of his presenting symptoms and the planned workup \nfor his lymphadenopathy, the decision was made to discharge him \nwith the remainder of his workup to be completed in the \noutpatient setting.  \n.  \n#Diabetes Mellitus: He has Diabetes Mellitus with a recent A1c \nof 8.4, but was not on any therapy for glycemic control.  We \nstarted him on an Insulin Sliding Scale while he was in the \nhospital, with good glycemic control, and we discharged him with \ninitiation of Metformin and information on a diabetic diet \ninformation sheet.   \n.  \n#Microcytic Anemia: He has a hematocrit of 36 with an MCV of 67. \n Differential for this primarily included iron deficiency \nanemia, hemoglobinopathy, or lead poisoning.  His iron labs were \nnormal, and his smear was never collected during admission.  As \nhis workup thus far was negative and he was asymptomatic from \nthis perspective, the decision was made to defer further workup \nto the outpatient setting.\n- An outpatient evaluation of his smear to evaluate for \nthalasemia is recommended\n.  \n#Hypothyroidism: He has a known diagnosis of hypothyroidism and \nis currently on Levothyroxine.  His TSH was 6.6, so we increased \nhis Levothyroxine dose to 100 mcg from 75 mcg.  He is stable for \ndischarge from this standpoint.\n.\n.\nTRANSFER OF CARE:\nMr. ___ is being discharged to home, with follow-up with \nhis outpatient providers.

Since prior \nexamination, there has been interval development of ill-defined \nsoft tissue abnormality in the mediastinum, surrounding the SVC. \n This abnormal soft tissue measures 4.9 x 4.0 x 5.7 cm.  There \nis near complete obliteration of the lumen of the SVC.  No \nadditional adenopathy is seen.  There is coronary artery \ncalcification.  There is trace pericardial fluid seen. \n\nLungs and pleura:  There are postoperative changes following \nleft pneumonectomy.  There is a small amount of fluid visualized \nwithin the left pneumonectomy.  This fluid is not significantly \nchanged from prior.  A small right pleural effusion is seen.  No \nconsolidation is seen.  There is a small nodule visualized in \nthe right upper lobe, series 3 from image 25 measuring 3 mm, \nstable from prior exam, possibly inflammatory. \n\nBones and soft tissues:  There is focus of sclerosis visualized \nwithin the T10 vertebral body, which is newly evident relative \nto prior exam. There is significant skin thickening as well \nsubcutaneous fat stranding visualized involving the left exilla \nand left breast.  Milder subcutaneous fat stranding is seen in \nthe right axilla.\n\nUpper abdomen: There is reflux of contrast material into the \nIVC.  Upper abdomen is otherwise unremarkable.\n\nImpression: \n\nInterval development 5.7 cm infiltrative soft tissue abnormality \nvisualized superior to the right atrium, surrounding the SVC and \nnearly obliterating its lumen.  Infiltrative malignant process \nis most likely.  Mediastinal fibrosis is possible, but the \nfocality of this abnormality makes malignancy more likely.  This \nfinding was discussed with ___, MD at the time of \ndictation.\n\nSignificant skin thickening of the left breast with edema and \nsubcutaneous fat stranding in the left breast and axilla.  The \nfindings may be a sequela of SVC syndrome, but intrinsic breast \nabnormality, either inflammatory or malignant, cannot be \nexcluded. \n\nInterval development of subtle sclerosis within the T10 \nvertebral body, new from prior examination, raising concern for \nmalignancy.\n\nPrior left pneumonectomy with trace fluid in the pneumonectomy \nspace.  No acute pulmonary process visualized in the \nhyperexpanded right lung with a 3 mm right upper lobe lung \nnodule, not changed from prior examination. \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nMs. ___ is a ___ with history of non-small cell lung cancer \ns\/p left pneumonectomy ___, XRT and chemotherapy with \ncarboplatin\/paclitaxel, afib on coumadin, presented to ___ \n___ on ___ for dyspnea on exertion, found to have \nSVC syndrome.\n\nMICU COURSE\n# SVC syndrome:  Pt was transferred from OSH to ___ MICU for \nconcern for SVC. CT showed a new infiltrative soft tissue \nabnormality surrounding the SVC nearly obliterating the lumen \nleading to severe symptoms with dyspnea, bilateral arm swelling, \nintermittent eye swelling and blurry vision, and \nlightheadedness.  This is likely secondary to infiltrative \nmalignancy.  Patient arrived hemodynamically stablewithout \nairway compromise or evidence of stridor, although dyspneic and \nwith new O2 requirement of 2L.  Patient received solumedrol \nprior to transfer. Patient was monitored overnight in the ICU \nwithout any episodes of hypotesnion, presyncopal or syncopal \nepisoes. Pt was transferred to the floor in stable condition. \n\n# NSCLC: Patient is status post left pneumonectomy, XRT and \nchemotherapy.  CT scan in ___ showed no evidence of active \ndisease until current admission imaging. The soft tissue mass \ncausing the SVC syndrome is likely recurrence of her primary \ncancer. There is no evidence of metastasis on staging CT Abdomen \nand Pelvis or MRI. The patient began radiation to this area and \nDocetaxel while inpatient (C2D3 on day of discharge). During \nadmission, attempts were made at biopsy of this new mass but \nthere were no accessible lymph nodes and the mass itself could \nnot be biopsied safely.    \n\n#Dyspnea: The patient started experiencing dyspnea after her \nstenting procedure. It was thought to be due to right heart \noverload considering the increased return to the right side of \nthe heart after stenting. Her dyspnea responded to lasix and \nduonebs and the patient was discharged on lasix and home oxygen. \n\n# Atrial fibrillation:  Patient arrived in atrial fibrillation \nbut rate controlled. Amiodaraone was continued. Pt had \nsupratherapeutic INR, and warfarin held pending possible \nintervention. She was discharged on warfarin with a lovenox \nbridge to follow up in her outpatient ___ clinic. \n\n# Hyponatremia: Likely hypovolemic hyponatremia as she appeared \ndry on exam.  Pt corrected to 133 at time of transfer and \nresolved at the time of discharge. \n\n# COPD:  Patient was continued on spiriva. She was discharged on \nalbuterol MDI. \n\n# Hyperlipidemia:  Patient was continued on simvastatin\n\n# Psych:  Patient was continued on citalopram\n\n# FEN:  No IVF for now, regular diet for now, replete prn\n# Prophylaxis:  Supratherapeutic on coumadin at this time\n# Access:  PIVs\n# Restraints:  None\n# Communication:  Patient at this time.

Multifocal patchy and linear \nopacities in the left mid and both lower lungs favor \natelectasis. Small pleural effusions are present bilaterally. \n___ Echo \nThe left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is \nmarkedly dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular \nhypertrophy with normal cavity size. Overall left ventricular \nsystolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 35-40%). The \nright ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with mild global \nfree wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal systolic septal \nmotion\/position consistent with right ventricular pressure \noverload. The ascending aorta is moderately dilated. The aortic \nvalve leaflets (3) are severely thickened\/deformed. There is \nsevere aortic valve stenosis (area <0.8cm2). Mild (1+) aortic \nregurgitation is seen.

Aortic Stenosis: \nShe was diagnosed with critical stenosis during a prior \nadmission. At that time, she was not interested in surgical \naortic valve repair but did agree to a cardiac catheterization \nwith valvuloplasty. She had minimal improvement in her aortic \nvalve after valvuloplasty. She tolerated the procedure well and \nwas discharged to rehab. Given her persistent symptoms, she did \nultimatly agree to surgery. Unfortunately she was thought to be \na very high risk for surgery due to likelihood of a difficult \nextubation and prolonged ventilator wean, and she was no longer \na candidate for surgical aortic valve repair. Given her limited \nother medical options, she was not interested in additional \ntherapy. She was made DNR\/DNI\/ Do not rehospitalize and was \ndischarged to rehab with plans to transition to hospice. \n.\n2. Congestive Heart Failure: \nMs. ___ was in acute on chronic systolic heart failure upon \narrival to ___ likely worsened related to her severe aortic \nstenosis. She was diuresed aggressively with a lasix drip and \nthen transitioned to oral lasix prior to discharge. She was \ninitially on 4L upon admission, required BiPap briefly, and was \nback to ___ upon discharge. Her furosemide was transitioned \nfrom a lasix drip to 120mg oral furosemide. \n.\n3. Hypoxia\nHer hypoxia was likely multifactorial and related to her \ncongestive heart failure, valvular disease, kyphosis, and her \nthyroid enlargement. \n.  \n4. Atrial fibrillation\nShe has chronic atrial fibrillation and was maintained on a beta \nblocker for rate control with coumadin for anticoagulation. She \nwas continued on her beta blocker and warfarin for symptomatic \ncontrol of her symptoms secondary to atrial fibrillation. \n.\n5. Goals of Care\nPatient was initially full code upon admission to ___ in \nanticipation of an aortic valve repair; however, when surgical \naortic valve repair was no longer an option, Ms. ___ was \nclear that she would not like any further interventions. She is \ninterested primarily in symptom control.

DF 86 \non admission, elevated to 107 at maximum. After initial \ninfectious workup yielded no growth, patient was started on \nprednisone for treatment. He received prednisone for 7 days \n(___). Lille 0.7 on day 7 of steroids indicated he was not \nsteroid responsive and steroids were stopped. He also has had a \nfeeding tube placed for maximal nutrition along with thiamine \nand folate supplemention. He was given ursodiol for cholestasis. \nBilirubin remained stably elevated between low ___ after \nsteroids completed. He was started on 400mg Pentoxifylline TID \non ___, with some improvement in renal failure but no \nimprovement in liver function. The patient's kidneys then began \nto worsen again, and diuresis became challenging. He was 20 \npounds up from his admission weight, and grossly volume \noverloaded. He had been comfortable during most of his \nadmission, and then began to develop shortness of breath due to \nvolume overloaded, requiring multiple doses of 80-100 mg IV \nLasix, which he did respond to. Given his failure to improve and \nworsening respiratory status and difficulty diuresing without \ncausing worsening renal failure, a family meeting was held on \n___, and patient expressed his clear desire to go home with \nhome hospice. He wants to be at home with his family, and to \nmaximize comfort and quality of life at this point in time.\n\n#Acute renal failure: Admission creatinine was 9.0 from baseline \n___. Workup yielded like prerenal from \ndecreased PO intake, diarrhea, alcohol hepatitis. He improved \nwith albumin and supportive care. However, when we attempted to \nrestarted diuresis, creatinine markedly came up, and diuresis \nwas again held. His kidney function began to improve, and then \nslowly began to decline again, and his volume status worsened as \nabove. Volume status was then what team focused on as he was \ndyspneic. \n\n#Afib: CHADS: 2. Metoprolol was started after the patient was \nhemodynamically stable.

You were started on a new medication, Pentoxifylline, to attempt to improve you liver function and kidney function. This also did not work very well. Because your liver and kidneys were both very sick, and you have a history of heart failure, your body became very full of fluid. It became difficult to manage the fluid in your body without hurting your kidneys. After many discussions with you and your family, you decided you would prefer to go home and spend your time with your family and focus on comfort and quality of life at this time. If you ever decide you want to come back to the hospital, you absolutely can."}

Left ventricular \nwall thickness, cavity size and regional\/global systolic \nfunction are normal (LVEF >55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests \nan increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). \nTransmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent \nwith Grade II (moderate) LV diastolic dysfunction. Right \nventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The \nascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) \nare mildly thickened. There is a minimally increased gradient \nconsistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic \nregurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly \nthickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral \nregurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is \nseen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. \nThere is no pericardial effusion. \n\nIMPRESSION: Normal global and regional biventricular systolic \nfunction. Moderate diastolic dysfunction with elevated left \nventricular filling pressure. Mild mitral and moderate tricuspid \nregurgitation. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.

Compared to the previous \nexamination, the right kidney is smaller in size. A hypoechoic \nfocus at the lower pole of the right kidney measuring 1.5 x 1.1 \nx 1.2 cm likely represents a simple cyst and allowing for \ndifferences in technique is unchanged compared to the previous \nultrasound. A bilobed anechoic focus within the mid-to-lower \npole measuring 2.3 x 1.3 x 2.6 cm is consistent with a simple \ncyst and is unchanged compared to the previous examination. \nThere is no hydronephrosis or renal calculi.

Preprocedure labs revealed acute worsening \nof renal function. Procedure was subsequently cancelled.\n.\n#.  Acute of Chronic Renal Failure: Pt with known Stage 4 CKD \nlikely secondary to HTN followed in ___ clinic is found to \nhave acutely elevated creatinine on day of presentation. Pt to \nbe evaluated prior to placement of permanent pacemaker. Pt \ndenies any recent illness or cause of dehydration. No new \nmedications started to suspect AIN. Pt denies any back pain, \ndysuria, or change in urination patterns or urine \ncharacteristics that would suggest infection or obstruction. \nBecause bradycardia is chronic it is unlikely that it alone \nwould cause the acute increase in creatinine. Renal ultrasound, \nurine lytes, urinalysis, SPEP, UPEP and culture were \nunrevealing. Suspect high dose diovan in combination with \ndehydration to be major contributors of worsening renal \nfunction.  Lasix and antihypertensives were held during \nhospitalization.  IVF were administered and creatinine improved \nfrom 4.5 to 2.5 on day of discharge.  \n.\n#.  HTN: chronic; reportedly poorly controlled at home.  \nTreatment options limited due to bradycardia. Nodal agents were \navoided. Lasix, diovan, and norvasc were held given acute renal \nfailure.  Pt's blood pressure unexpectedly remained well \ncontrolled during this hospitalization in the absence of any \nantihypertensive medications.  Per renal team, goal systolic \nblood pressure is 130-150.  Pt's blood pressure was consistently \nbelow this range so medications were not restarted at the time \nof discharge.  Pt instructed to follow up with a primary care \nprovider to monitor blood pressure and to discuss need for \nrestarting medications. \n.\n#.  Bradycardia: Asymptomatic. HR in 40-50s prior to pacemaker \nplacement. Followed by Dr. ___ in outpatient.  Pt was \ncleared for pacemaker placement by renal after initial \nevaluation for acute of chronic renal failure had been \ncompleted. Pace maker implanted on ___ without complication. \n Question of small pneumothorax on initial CXR after procedure.  \nRepeat CXR was less convincing.  Pt hemodynamically stable and \nasymptomatic at time of discharge.

There is a small displaced fracture of the right orbital rim \n(series 3 \nimages 17 and 18). \n\nAbdominal US ___\nIMPRESSION:  \n1. Echogenic and coarsened liver consistent with steatosis. \nOther forms of liver disease including hepatic fibrosis or \ncirrhosis or steatohepatitis cannot be excluded on the basis of \nthis examination. \n2. 9 mm hypoechoic lesion in the right lobe full which a MRI of \nthe abdomen is recommended for further evaluation given \nsuspected underlying liver disease. \n\nMRI abdomen\/pelvis ___\nIMPRESSION:  \n1. Cirrhotic appearing liver with innumerable regenerative \nnodules.  No \nlesion meeting OPTN-5 criteria for ___. \n2. Evidence of portal hypertension with mild splenomegaly and \nvarices.  No ascites. \n3. Abnormal enhancement along the left paraspinal muscles, which \nis most \nlikely traumatic, given the history of a recent fall.  Likely \nnondisplaced fractures of the L1, L2, and possibly L3 transverse \nprocesses. \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nMr. ___ is a ___ year old man with EtOH abuse, h\/o EtOH \nwithdrawal seizures who presents s\/p fall with abdominal pain \nand concern for EtOH withdrawal.\n\n#Fall w\/head strike: Thought to be mechanical in nature, as \npatient intoxicated and reported no dizziness or palpatations \nprior to the fall. No report of seizure activity surrounding the \nfall, no bowel or bladder incontinence. EKG normal, no \narrythmias. Patient likely fell on face, as he presented with R \norbital fracture and frontal scalp hematoma. Head CT negative \nfor intracranial bleed. No focal deficits on neuro exam. Patient \nseen by plastic surgery and determined no entrapment, no \nsurgical intervention needed. Evaluated by opthalmology, who \ndetermined to damage to eye or changes in vision. No falls while \ninpatient. Patient to follow up with ophtalmology and plastic \nsurgery as outpatient\n\n# Abdominal pain: Patient presented with abdominal pain, with \nTTP in RUQ on exam and elevated LFT's. Patient also reports \nepisode of hemoptysis in ED. Concern for pancreatitis vs. \nalcoholic hepatitis, versus cholecystitis, vs gastritis\/duodenal \nulcer. Patient's lipase 85, so pancreatitis unlikely. No fevers \non exam, no leukocytosis, so cholecystitis is less likely. \nAST\/ALT 2:1 ratio, consistent with long standing alcohol abuse, \npatient extremely tender to palpation in RUQ, so alcoholic \nhepatitis was a consideration. Discriminant factor: 5, so no \nrole for steroids. Finally, patient reported episode of \nhemoptysis, recent dark stools, so duodenal ulcer, gastritis a \nconcern. RUQ revealed small 9mm mass in liver (f\/u MRI \nrecommended), but was otherwise unremarkable. Follow up MRI \nshowed evidence of cirrhosis, but no HCC. Patient's abdominal \npain improved without intervention and he was discharged with GI \nfollow up.\n\n#Cirrhosis: MRI revealed multinodular liver consistent with \ncirrhosis. Patient also thrombocytopenic (platelets 58 on \nadmission). INR 1.2. Likely secondary to chronic alcohol abuse, \nas hepatitis panel negative. Patient had no stigmata of \ncirrhosis on exam and no evidence of decompensation. The primary \nteam educated the patient on cirrhosis and counselded him to \nstop drinking.

Patient was found \nto be in a heart failure exacerbation, possibly related to a \nsmall decrease in his Lasix dose from 60 to 40 mg as an \noutpatient vs. worsening underlying function of the mitral \nvalve. Patient responded well to diuresis with Lasix gtt at \n10cc\/hour. Initial weight 71 kg and discharge weight 64.2kg. For \npatient's permanent afib, patient presented with INR of 6.7 \nwithout any signs of bleeding. He was given vitamin K in CDAC. \nHis warfarin was held until ___, and on ___ he was given \n0.5mg. His INR was 3.1 on ___ (prior to getting warfarin), and \n2.4 on ___. Although within the therapeutic range, his Coumadin \ndose was still being tritrated for goal INR ___ on discharge.\n\nMedication Changes:\n- Medications Held: Doxazosin 2mg QHS (for low BPs) \n- Medications Changed: \n Furosemide 60mg PO qd (from 40mg) \n Warfarin 1mg PO qd, but still being titrated on discharge (from \n2.5mg 5x\/wk, 5mg 1x\/wk, 3.75m 1x\/wk)\n- Medications Started: \n Famotidine 20 mg PO\/NG DAILY Heartburn \n\n- Discharge Weight: 64.2kg (dry weight 67kg)\n- Discharge Creatinine: 1.4\n- Discharge Diuretic: Furosemide 60mg daily \n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES\n[ ] Patient enrolled in the PACT program as there were questions \nabout whether he was reliably taking the correct medication \nregimen.\n[ ] Patient discharged on a new warfarin regimen, still \ntitrating. INR should be checked on ___, and daily \nafter that until in therapeutic range for 3 consecutive days. \nAfter that it can be checked weekly.\n[ ] F\/u CBC as patient's discharge hemoglobin was 7.7 (admission \nHb 9.2). This was likely due to repeated blood draws, as patient \nhas no signs\/symptoms to suggest that he is actively bleeding.\n[ ] Doxazosin 2mg QHS is being held because his pressures could \nnot tolerate it while inpatient.

He was found to have new RLL \nconsolidation, treated for HAP with Vanc (___) and \n___ with plan to complete 7 day course of cefepime. He \nwas found to have ___, with peak Cr 2.3 on ___ ___ 1.5-1.9) \nwhich improved somewhat with diuresis. Renal ultrasound showed \nno obstruction. Cath was not initially performed due to likely \ntype II NSTEMI, ___ with transplanted kidney, and was eventually \nperformed on ___ with ___ 2 to RCA, with plan for repeat cath \nand LAD in future given ___ and renal transplant. His renal \nfunction and volume status remained stable with holding diuresis \nafter cath, and he was discharged with plan for repeat cath on \n___, and renal, cardiology, and orthopedic follow up.\n\nACUTE ISSUES:  \n=============  \n#NSTEMI\n#Diastolic HF exacerbation\nAfter ORIF, he seemed to recovering well with a course \ncomplicated only by ___ (Cr increased to ~2 from baseline of \n~1.2). On ___, he developed nausea in the morning and gradually \nbecame dyspneic with a new cough over the course of the day. In \nthe evening, he developed dull, left-sided chest pain and \nvomiting and was felt to be diaphoretic. An ECG revealed new \ninferolateral ST depressions and his cTnT was 0.13. Cardiology \nwas consulted for NSTEMI. He was started on ASA and a heparin \ndrip, but cardiology consult service did not feel a LHC was \nwarranted given likely type II STEMI at the time, as well as ___ \non transplanted kidney. His respiratory distress gradually \nincreased through the AM on ___, and he was started on BiPAP. A \nTTE on ___ showed new LAD-territory wall motion abnormalities. \nHe was started on vanc\/cefepime\/azithromycin out of concern for \npneumonia, and ID was consulted given his renal transplant \nhistory. He received IV Lasix boluses up to 200mg and sublingual \nnitroglycerine x2. He was found to have ___, with peak Cr 2.3 on \n___ ___ 1.5-1.9) which improved somewhat with diuresis. He was \nweaned off bipap ___ and transferred to the floor. On the floor \nhe was started on an IV lasix drip and his dyspnea and oxygen \nrequirements gradually improved. Given improving renal function, \nhe underwent coronary angiography where two DES were placed in \nthe RCA with plan for interval stenting of LAD lesion in two \nweeks time. He was euvolemic at time of discharge with stable \nrenal function for two days off of diuretics, and was therefore \ndischarged off of diuretics. If weight gain, hypoxemia, lower \nextremity edema, consider IV diuresis (has required 200mg IV \nLasix and gtt at 20\/hr). Continue ASA, Plavix, rosuvastatin, and \nmetoprolol.\n\n___ on CKD s\/p renal transplant:\nInitially, the patient had increased Cr in the setting of volume \noverlaod and poor systolic cardiac function making a cardiorenal \nsyndrome a likely cause. He subsequently had aggressive diuresis \nwith improvement in Cr. (baseline Cr is 1.2-1.4). He \nsubsequently had rising Cr post-cath suggesting some contrast \nnephropathy. His Cr stabilized at 2.0 on discharge. Transplant \nnephrology followed while inpatient and tacro dosing was kept \nthe same per their recommendations. He will need renal \ntransplant follow up within 6 weeks. He should have chem-7 \nre-checked either daily, or at least by ___. His next \ntacro level should be checked ___ am 12 hours after last dose.\n\n#Anemia: \nHct ~23 from baseline of 30 following L tibial ORIF. Likely a \ncombination of hemodilution and intraoperative blood loss. Hb \ndrop to 6.7 on ___, last transfusion ___ received 1 unit\npRBCs with appropriate response. Now improving with Hgb >8.\n\n#Leukocytosis:\n#PNA:\nPatient developed WBC to 12.5 on ___. Given the correlation with \nthe development of his NSTEMI symptoms, it is likely that this \nrepresents a non-specific inflammatory response to infarction. \nHe had concomitant development of a cough and hypoxemia which \nraised the possibility of PNA, though his chest X-ray showed no \nfocal consolidations. ID was consulted given his history of \nrenal transplant will continue cefepime. Blood cultures were \nnegative and he completed a course with Cefepime (___). The \npatients WBC count remained wnl and he remained without fevers \nfor the remainder of his hospitalization.\n\n#DM1: \nComplicated by diabetic retinopathy, ulcers. ___ was \nconsulted and discharge regimen as attached.\n\n#S\/p renal transplant: \nDCD kidney in ___. Patient is on immunosuppression regimen per \ntransplant nephrology of mycophenalate, prednisone (5 mg) daily \nand tacrolimus 2 mg PO BID with goal tacrolimus level of ___. \nTroughs to be drawn 12 hours after ___ dose.

The patient will follow up with \northo trauma clinic Per the medical record, the patient \nfractured his L tibia in ___ and had an IM nail placed in \n___. Over the next several months, there was concern for soft \ntissue infection, and the nail was removed in ___. He was \ntreated empirically for osteomyelitis. An external fixator was \nplaced in ___, and due to persistent ___, he underwent \nORIF with medial plating on ___.\n\n#Diarrhea\nAfter a course of antibiotics and aggressive bowel regimen \ninitiation following constipation, the patient developed large \nvolume loose stools. Given the patients immunosupression and \nantibiotic risk, cdiff, stool cultures and CMV were sent.

This was likely exacerbated by his recent alcohol use \n(serum tox level was 51 on admission)and he was possibly \nsomewhat volume depleted given his ketonuria. Initial physical \nexam showed diaphoresis, tremulousness, and cerebellar signs \nconsistent with alcohol intoxication\/early withdrawal. ___ in ED \nwas WNL, so hypoglycemia was unlikely contributing factor. Had a \nsimilar, but less severe episode ont he commuter rail 2 weeks \nago, also after a weekend of drinking EtOH. His episode did not \noccur after rising to standing position so unlikely to be \northostatic syncope. Cardiogenic syncope (arrhythmia, \nhypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy) was considered less \nlikely given that he did not lose consiousness suddenly and did \nnot have a true LOC. He underwent an ECG which showed normal \nsinus rhythm with left axis deviation as well as left \nventricular hypertrophy and was placed on telemetry which \ndemonstrated no electrical abnormalities. There was no evidence \non history or physical exam to suggest seizure or TIA as cause.  \n\n.\n#EtOH Abuse\/Tobacco use: Patient reported drinking ___ cups of \nvodka daily for the past ___s having recent \nalcohol use with serum tox positive for alcohol on admission. \nTherefore, there was concern for withdrawal and he was placed on \na CIWA scale, although did not require any diazepam and \nmanifested only mild tremulousness. He was started on folic acid \n1 mg QD and thiamine 100 mg QD daily and will be discharged on \nthese as well. He was also placed on a nicotine patch given his \nsignificant tobacco use and supplied with prescriptions for \nnicotine patch and gum. \n.\n#Gait disturbance: Patient describes feeling unsteady on his \nfeet, particularly in shower and when he closes his eyes that \nhas developed slowly over past year. His neuro exam was notable \nfor proprioceptive loss in b\/l toes, and wide-based gait with \nshort steps, with an inability to tandem walk which was \nconsistent with a sensory ataxia (disturbance of the dorsal \ncolumns or of peripheral nerves). This was thought to be \nsecondary to a direct toxic alcoholic peripheral neuropathy \ncomplicated by concurrent nutritional deficiencies, although \nvitamin B12 level was normal. He was started on thiamine and \ninformed that his alcohol use was the likely cause. \n.\n#Hypertension: Patient was found to be hypertensive (max \n177\/100) while in house and was started on chlorthalidone prior \nto discharge. He will need follow-up with PCP in next few days \nto address his blood pressure response. \n.\nINACTIVE ISSUES:\n.\n#Depression: Patient stated that he has felt depressed over the \npast year, especially since the loss of his girlfriend ___ year \nago. He expressed interest in mental health services and social \nwork was consulted. \n.\n#Tongue polyps: Incidentally found over ___ years ago and have \nnot been a significant issue and been stable in size.

You were worked up for possible causes of this episode including heart problems, problems with your blood, kidneys, or nerve problems. You underwent an electrocardiogram, which measures the electrical activity of the heart. This showed that part of your heart, the left ventricle, is enlarged (the wall is thicker), but did not show any abnormal rhythms or reasons to believe your episode was due to your heart. You also had a chest x ray which showed that the heart and lungs were normal. You were also found to have high blood pressure, which explains why the left side of your heart is larger (it must pump against a higher pressure)."}

The aortic valve leaflets \n(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and \nno aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve \nleaflets are structurally normal. No mitral regurgitation is \nseen. The tricuspid valve leaflets fail to fully coapt. Severe \n[4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is severe pulmonary \nartery systolic hypertension. [In the setting of at least \nmoderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, the estimated \npulmonary artery systolic pressure may be underestimated due to \na very high right atrial pressure.] The main pulmonary artery is \ndilated.

She psychiatrically stabilized with uptitration \nof clozapine, but was found to have neutropenia and thus was \ntransferred to the Medicine service at ___ for neutropenic \nprecautions and count recovery.\n\nACUTE ISSUES:\n===============\n# Neutropenia\n# Clozapine Agranulocytosis\nAs above, Ms. ___ was initially admitted to ___ for \ninpatient psychiatric management of her decompensated \nschizophrenia. On admission, her ANC was ___. However, in the \nsetting of increase of clozapine from 25mg QHS to 150mg QHS, her \nANC was found to be 930. Her last dose of clozapine was \n___. Of note, the patient has a history of DLBCL s\/p 6 \ncycles of R-CHOP ___, however other cell lines have been \nstable. It was felt that her neutropenia was less likely due to \nother medications such as risperidone or INH, though INH was \nlater discontinued due to transaminitis as below. During her \nhospitalization on Medicine, her ANC fluctuated. Per discussion \nwith Hem\/Onc, median time to recovery from clozapine is 12 days \nand up to 3 weeks, with expected fluctuations. It was thus felt \nthat a bone marrow biopsy could be deferred. She received 300mg \nx 1 of GCSF on ___, with recovery of ANC to 5690. \nThroughout her stay, she remained afebrile and without \nlocalizing signs of infection.  Pt was given education and \nanticipatory guidance that any fevers > 100.4 or generalized \nillness would require urgent evaluation.  Pt is scheduled to f\/u \nwith hem\/onc on ___ for follow up labs and possible re-dose \nof neupogen.\n\n# Schizophrenia\nAs above, Ms. ___ clozapine was held. However, she \nremained psychiatrically stable on risperidone 4mg PO QHS and \nrisperidone 25mg long acting injectable q2 weeks. Psychiatry \nfollowed during her stay on Medicine with no change in \nrecommendations. She also received ramelteon and lorazepam as \nneeded for insomnia. Last dose of risperidone long acting \ninjectable ___.\n\n# Elevated transaminases\n# Latent TB Infection, on INH\/Pyridoxine\nMs. ___ was noted to have recurrent mild elevation in \ntransaminase levels beginning ___. Possibly medication \nrelated due to uptitrated clozapine given time course, though \ndid not resolve with cessation of clozapine and per discussion \nwith Pharmacy, would not expect this degree of hepatotoxicity \ngiven previously well-tolerated clozapine as outpatient. More \nlikely due to INH administration; patient was started on this \n___ for projected ___nd INH-mediated \nhepatotoxicity can occur within ___ month time frame. RUQUS \nshowed only chronic hepatic hemangiomas, which was consistent \nwith previous CT A\/P ___. Repeat hepatitis serologies \nnegative.

An effort was made to \ncall her rest home, though no one answered on multiple attempts. \nThe patient is a ___ year-old right-handed ___ home resident \nwith a history of atrial fibrillation (formerly on warfarin, now \non baby aspirin), hypertension, stroke (associated with right \narm\/hand weakness and shaking), dementia, and possible cervical \nspondylosis with myelopathy, now presents for evaluation of \nweakness and dizziness.\n\nHer daughter at bedside spoke with her mother by phone last \nevening at 7:30 pm.  The patient reported that her right hand \nwas weak at that time, though she denied dizziness, and had no \nother complaints.  The patient, for her part does not recall \nmuch prior to this morning.  According to her, she awoke today \nand got ready for breakfast as usual.  However, as she reached \nfor her walker, she noted trouble moving her right arm.  \nSpecifically, she states that she had difficulty grabbing hold \nof her walker, but could not elaborate further.  She began to \ndress herself, but could not finish, and needed assistance, as \nher right hand was shaking a bit.  She has had intermittent \nright hand shaking for at least the past year, and the last \nepisode known to her daughter was one month ago.  She was seen \nby a physician at that time, but was not admitted to the \nhospital.  The patient is not sure why the episodes come on and \nis not aware of any exacerbating or alleviating factors (such as \nmovement).  The daughter witnessed an right hand shaking at \ndinner several months ago; she was able to suppress it by \nholding the right hand and rubbing it.  \n\nThis morning, her daughter was told by staff at her home that \nshe had right hand weakness and perhaps some left leg pain.  The \nreferral for the patient to the emergency room stated that the \npatient had a \"dizzy\" episode, LEFT arm weakness, and \"trouble\" \nwalking.  Though she does get \"dizzy\" at times, the patient does \nnot recall any of these symptoms today.  EMS apparently reported\nthat her right arm shaking was resolving, but that there was no \ndrift, equal grasps, and clear speech.  On arrival here, the \npatient was noted to have LEFT arm and leg weakness by ER staff. \nHer fingerstick at 10:10 am was 151.  She was given 325 mg \naspirin.\n\nThe patient does report that she has had episodes of \"dizziness\" \nfor quite some time.  She describes it as an unsteadiness with \nposition change, such as when she gets up or reaches for an \nobject.  It occurs only for  a \"moment,\" though she is afraid of \nfalling at that time.                \n\nReview of Systems: She has had occasional numbness and tingling \nin the past but does not recall where.  She has chronic hearing \nloss, but no tinnitus.\nHer daughter reports that she may be tilting her head a bit more \nto the right recently, though the patient denies diplopia.  She \nhas had falls in the past, the most recent of which was months \nago; she has not had associated loss of consciousness.  She \nreports chronic lower back pain, no leg involvement.  She has \nhad diarrhea recently and occasionally gets short of breath.  \nDenies headache, fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, chest pain, \nincontinence of the bowel or bladder, vision loss or change, \ndysarthria, dysphagia, incomprehension, incoordination. \n \nPast Medical History:\n-By review of OMR had three episodes of right arm\/hand weakness\nand shaking on ___: seen at ___ and had a \"small\nparietal stroke\" \n-Hypertension\n-Atrial fibrillation, on warfarin in the past, now on aspirin. \nIt is unclear when she was last on warfarin or the reason for \nthe\ndiscontinuation. \n-Dementia\n-Presumed cervical spondylosis with myelopathy, seen by Dr.\n___ in ___ for evaluation of gait disorder\n-CHF (LVEF>55% on ECHO ___\n-Anemia\n-Urinary tract infections\n-Hypothyroidism\n-Depression\n-s\/p cataract repair\n-s\/p hemorrhoid surgery\n \nSocial History:\n___\nFamily History:\nLargely unknown, as the patient was adopted.

The patient is a ___ year old \nwoman with a history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, \ndementia, and previous stroke associated with right arm\/hand \nweakness and shaking, who presented with a 1 day history of \nincreased difficulty moving her right hand and intermittent \nshaking of her right hand. CT head on admission showed no acute \nintracranial hemorrhage, chronic left occipital infarction, and \nchronic lacunar infarctions in the subinsular regions and \nexternal capsules. MRI\/MRA head showed small areas of \nsubcortical increased signal within the left parietal lobe which \nmay indicate acute infarct. Carotid ultrasound showed minimal \nplaque with bilateral less than 40% carotid stenosis. TTE showed \nLVEF >60%, mild to moderate (___) MR, moderate pulmonary artery \nsystolic hypertension. CEs: CK 62-60, TropT <0.01x2, FLP: Chol \n198, ___ 59, LDL 107, HDL 79, HgA1c 6.0%.\nIt was thought that the most likely cause of her stroke was \ncardioembolic.

Lung volumes are slightly lower with persistent \nconsolidation at the left base likely reflecting combination of \npleural fluid and left lower lobe atelectasis or pneumonia.  \nStreaky opacities at the right base are slightly worse,\nsuggestive of increasing atelectasis.  No pulmonary edema.  No \npneumothorax. \nGiven the left basilar airspace process, assessment of cardiac \nand mediastinal\ncontours is limited on this study.\n\n___ CXR:\nInterval removal of right internal jugular vascular catheter \nwith no visible pneumothorax.  Stable cardiomegaly.  Slight \nimproved aeration at right lung base, but no appreciable change \nin left retrocardiac opacity with adjacent small left pleural \neffusion.  Small right pleural effusion extending\ninto the minor fissure appears unchanged.\n \n___ CXR: \nDense consolidation and volume loss at the left lung base are \ndiagnostic of left lower lobe collapse, present without \nappreciable change since ___.  Pulmonary vascular \ncongestion persists in the right lung and a small region of \nbasal atelectasis or consolidation has changed in severity and \nprecise location over the past several days but not in overall \nseverity.  Severe enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is \nunchanged.  ET tube and right internal jugular line are in \nstandard placements and an upper enteric drainage tube passes to \nthe upper stomach and out of view.  No pneumothorax.  At least a \nsmall left pleural effusion is present, secondary  to the left \nlowerlobe collapse. \n\n___ RENAL US: \nLimited examination due to poor acoustic penetration. 2.7 cm \nleft kidney upper pole lesion appears consistent with simple \ncyst. \n\n___ CT CHEST:\n1. Bibasilar atelectasis and left basilar mucus plugging of the \nsubsegmental airways. \n2. 7 mm right middle lobe lung nodule. As per the ___ \n___ Pulmonary Nodule Guidelines, followup chest CT is \nrecommended in ___ months for a low risk patient and ___ months \nfor a high risk patient. \n3. Dilated main pulmonary artery compatible with pulmonary \narterial \nhypertension. \n\n___ CT HEAD: \n1. No evidence of acute intracranial process.   \n2. Opacification of the left mastoid and middle ear cavity with \npooled \nsecretions in the nasopharynx are likely related to the \npatient's intubated status. \n3. Evidence of global atrophy \n\n___ CTAB: \n1. No explanation for hypotension. \n2. Nonspecific free fluid underneath both diaphragms and along \nthe right \npericolic gutter. This may be a result of volume resuscitation. \n3. Questionable small bowel wall thickening most likely \nrepresent s \nundermixing of oral contrast and fluid in small bowel loops. \n4. Upper pole left renal lesion does not meet criteria for a \nsimple cyst, but may represent a complex cyst.  Further \nevaluation with ultrasound is \nrecommended. \n\n___ LENIs: \nNo right or left leg DVT.\n\n___ echo: \nThe left atrium is normal in size. The left ventricular cavity \nis unusually small. Overall left ventricular systolic function \nis normal (LVEF 55%). Right ventricular chamber size is normal. \nwith normal free wall contractility. The diameters of aorta at \nthe sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. There are \nsimple atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are three aortic \nvalve leaflets. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral \nvalve leaflets are structurally normal. Trivial mitral \nregurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion. \nIMPRESSION: No ascending aortic dissection. Small LV cavity with \nnormal systolic function.\n\n___ portable abdomen:\nLimited study demonstrates moderately prominent loops of small \nbowel similar to that seen previously, which may be due to air \nswallowing \nversus obstruction.  If there is high suspicion for obstruction, \nan abdominal CT may be obtained. \n\n___ CT HEAD: no acute intracranial process\n\n___ CT abd\/pelvis: no RP bleed or solid organ injury. \n4mm right lung base nodule, ___ f\/u if hx of malignancy or \nsmoking. otherwise, no f\/u needed. hypodense hepatic lesion, \nincompletely characterized, likely cysts or hemangiomas. \n\nMICROBIOLOGY\n===========\n___ 4:03 pm URINE      Source: Catheter. \n\n                            **FINAL REPORT ___\n\n   URINE CULTURE (Final ___:    NO GROWTH. \n\n___ 4:03 pm STOOL     CONSISTENCY: NOT APPLICABLE\n      Source: Stool. \n\n                            **FINAL REPORT ___\n\n   C. difficile DNA amplification assay (Final ___: \n      Negative for toxigenic C. difficile by the Illumigene DNA\n      amplification assay. \n           (Reference Range-Negative). \n\n___ 9:30 am BRONCHIAL WASHINGS\n      PLEASE RUN DESPITE ORAL FLUID .

Required three pressors (norepinephrine, \nphenylepherine, and vasopressin) for maintenance of MAPs>60mmHg. \nThese were down-titrated as tolerated.  The patient was also \nfluid resuscitated with boluses of NS.  He was empirically \nstarted on vancomycin, cefepime, and metronidazole, and \neventually transitioned to meropenem secondary to persistence of \nleukocytosis and fevers.  Antibiotics were discontinued on ___. \n Culture data was all negative.  Echocardiogram revealed normal \nventricular function.  Patient continued to be afebrile and \nwithout leukocytosis throughout the remainder of his hospital \ncourse. \n\n# Respiratory failure: Patient was electively intubated for \nworsening metabolic abnormalities. Mechanical ventilation was \nweaned as tolerated and he was extubated on ___. Following \nextubation, the patient was weaned to room air, but later on in \nhis hospital course, he developed a new oxygen requirement.  \nFurosemide trial was attempted, and incentive spirometry was \nencouraged.  Patient was satting at92% RA on day of discharge \nand no longer had a demand for oxygen.\n\n# Hyperkalemia: Likely elevated in the setting of renal failure. \nHad questionable peaked T-waves in the ED.  He received \ntreatment with D50, insulin, and albuterol at OSH with \npersistently elevated potassium.  He also received kayexelate, \ncalcium gluconate, D50, insulin in fluids in the ___ ED.  Due \nto persistent metabolic abnormalities, he was started on CVVH.  \nHis potassium improved and normalized with return of his kidney \nfunction. \n\n# Acute on chronic kidney injury: Patient with elevated \ncreatinine in the acute setting.  FeNa of 1% which is equivocal \nfor prerenal vs ATN.  Nephrotoxic medications were avoided and \nhis medications were renally dosed. He was started on CVVH as \nabove and nephrology recommendations were followed. Ultimately, \nhis kidney function improved and he did not require any renal \nreplacement therapy. Cr at the time of discharge was 1.5. \n\n# Atrial fibrillation: CHADS score of 3. Required cardioversion \nseveral times secondary to hypotension and RVR with HR to the \n160s. An amiodarone drip was initiated but aborted ___ after no \nimprovement in heart rate.  He was also refractory to diltiazem \ngtt and esmolol gtt.  This likely was exacerbated by metabolic \nderangements, refractory shock, and atrial stretch from \nhypervolemia.  He was digoxin loaded ___ and this was \ncontinued during his hospitalization. Amiodarone was restarted \n___.  As pressors were weaned off and blood pressure \nstabilized, metoprolol was intiated with improvement in his \nheart rate. Further, he was reinitiated on an amiodarone drip \nfor loading for a total of ten grams. His anticoagulation \noriginally was held secondary to supratherapeutic levels. It was \nnot reinitiated at the time of call out from the MICU. \nCardiology recommended call out to the cardiology service for \nfurther management. Once on the cardiology service, the patient \ncontinued to be in atrial fibrillation, with rates into \n100-120s.  Patient was initially maintained on digoxin and \nmetoprolol, but was not well rate controlled. Diltiazem was \nadded, but heart rates continued to be elevated. This lack of \nresponse to oral medications was thought to be due to \nmalabsoption in the setting of large-volume diarrhea discussed \nbelow. As such, efforts were made to better control the \ndiarrhea, and as his bowels slowed, heart rates became better \ncontrolled.  Patient's warfarin was restarted on ___ when his \nINR came back down to 2.7.  It was initiated at a dose of 2.5 \nmg.  Patient's INR will need to be rechecked on ___.\n\n# Diarrhea: At baseline the patient has a protuberant abdomen. \nClinically, there was a concern for intraabdominal process \ncontributing to his refractory shock. His stool cultures, \nincluding C. diff PCR, were negative. He had a Flexiseal placed \nfor rectal decompression.  He continued to have diarrhea that \nwas believed to be non-infectious and related to bowel loss of \nhis normal gut flora.  He was started on loperamide and tincture \nof opium while in the MICU. Once the floor, the patient was \ngiven cholestyramine in addition to loperamide with eventual \nimprovement in his diarrhea.  \n\n# Anemia: Patient with baseline hematocrit in ___.  This has \nbeen downtrending since admission.  Patient has had guaiac \npositive stools this admission, but no overt melena.  Guaiac \npositive stools were not unexpected in the setting of large \nvolume diarrhea.  Iron studies were consistent with anemia of \nchronic disease.  On ___, the patient was experiencing some \nbright blood mixed with stool, likely from active hemorrhoids.  \nHematocrit was stable between ___, and he was not orthostatic. \n He will need daily hematocrit checks and hemorrhoid care.\n\n# Citrate administration: Iatrogenic administration into \nsystemic circulation. Discovered in the ___ of ___ with \ntoxicology consulted for recommendations. Calcium was checked \nq2hrs for monitoring of hypocalcemia with calcium gluconate for \nrepletion. Adverse side effects of citrate toxicity include \nhypocalcemia and QTc prolongation. Ionized Ca++ was monitored \nand was maintained >1 with calcium gluconate administration. Per \ntoxicology, likely cleared from system over 24hrs. Never \nexperienced QTc prolongation.   \n\n# Metabolic acidosis: Likely secondary to renal failure and \ninability to clear hydrogen ions. Lactic acid normal. Patient \nreceived bicarbonate in the ED. Improved with management and \nresolution of shock. \n\n# Toxic metabolic encephalopathy: Following extubation the \npatient's mental status waxed and waned. This continued for a \nmajority of his hospital stay. The cause was thought to be \nsecondary to many of the metabolic derangements discussed above \nas well as disturbances in sleep\/wake cycles. As the ___ \nhospital course became more stable, his mental status improved \nas well. \n\n# Hyperphosphatemia: Elevated on admission likely in the setting \nof renal failure. Improved with CVVH and return of renal \nfunction. \n\nINACTIVE ISSUES\n---------------\n# Diabetes mellitus: Blood glucose monitored and managed with \ninsulin sliding scale.\n\n# Hypertension: Anti-hypertensives initially were held secondary \nto triple pressor requirement. They were restarted as tolerated. \n\n# Hyperlipidemia: On simvastatin\n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\n--------------------\n- 7 mm right middle lobe lung nodule.

During your stay you required a number of different antibiotics to help eliminate a suspected infection. You were also found to be in an abnormal heart rhythm, called atrial fibrillation. Due to this abnormal heart rhythm and your infection, your blood pressures dropped and you needed special medications to help you maintain a good blood pressure. In order to help you breathe, you needed to be intubated and you also required a form of dialysis to help remove fluid from your lungs. After an extended stay in the ICU, you eventually were able to be taken off the ventilator and you blood pressure stabilized. You were transferred to the floor. While on the floor your kidney function, diarrhea, rapid heart rate and mental status slowly improved."}

Overlying EKG leads are \npresent somewhat limiting the evaluation. There is no focal \nconsolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax.  No overt signs of \nedema. Suture in the right mid lung is noted. Heart size is \ntop-normal. Imaged osseous structures are intact. IMPRESSION: No \nacute intrathoracic process\n\n___ TTE:\nThe left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall \nthickness, cavity size and regional\/global systolic function are \nnormal (LVEF >55%). Right ventricular chamber size is normal. \nTricuspid annular plane systolic excursion is normal (2.2 cm; \nnl>1.6cm) consistent with normal right ventricular systolic \nfunction. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and \narch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear \nstructurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic \nstenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears \nstructurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is \nno mitral valve prolapse. There is mild pulmonary artery \nsystolic hypertension. There is a moderate sized pericardial \neffusion. The effusion appears circumferential. There is no \ncardiac tamponade.  IMPRESSION: Moderate-sized pericardial \neffusion without tamponade physiology. Normal global and \nregional biventricular systolic function. Mild pulmonary \nhypertension. \n\n___ CT Chest:\n1. Mild progression of sequelae of known scleroderma, including \nchronic inflammatory small airways disease, esophageal \ndysmotility, small pericardial effusion, and mediastinal \nlymphadenopathy.\n2. Multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules range up to 4 mm in \ndiameter, many of which are new since the prior CT from ___. \nFollow-up imaging is recommended in 12 months.\n\n___ Right Heart Cath:\n 1. Moderate severity pulmonary hypertension, with some \nimprovement after inhaled nitric oxide.\n 2. Normal left and right heart filling pressures. Waveforms are \nnot suggestive of tamponade or pericardial \nconstriction\/restriction.\n\n___ VQ Scan:\nVentilation and Perfusion images show homogenous uptake without \nany segmental or subsegmental defects. Chest CT shows \nprogression of sequelae of known scleroderma, including chronic \ninflammatory small airways disease, esophageal dymsotility, \nsmall pericardial effusion, and mediastinal lymphadenopathy.  \nThere is no acute parenchymal process. IMPRESSION: Normal \nventilation \/ perfusion scan.\n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ year old female with a history of CREST syndrome c\/b chronic \nassociated pericardial effusion, esophageal dysmotility, mild \npulmonary artery hypertension, presenting with acute worsening \nof progressive dyspnea on exertion.  \n\n# Hypoxia\/Dyspnea:  Differential included recurrent pericardial \neffusion, pulmonary fibrosis ___ scleroderma, worsening \npulmonary arterial hypertension, chronic aspiration from \nesophageal dysmotility, MAC given age and pulmonary nodules. \nLess likely PNA (normal WBC, no cough, fever), CHF (normal BNP), \nPE (normal D-dimer). The leading causes were sufficiently \ninvestigated via TTE (with bubble), RHC, CT, VQ Scan. Mild \nworsening of pulmonary artery hypertension was observed on right \nheart catheterization and cardiac output improved with \nvasodilating agent. Findings were not enough to explain degree \nof dyspnea.  Ambulation on day prior to discharge after warming \nhands under hot water showed a good pleth and that she was in \nfact not hypoxic with ambulation. The low oximtery values that \nhad motivated the workup up of dyspnea on exertion were then \nthought to be spurious findings, related to her Raynaud's \nsymptoms. With this in mind, her dyspnea was thought to be \nsecondary to chronic reconditioning. \n\n# Sjo___'s syndrome: The patient has chronic sicca symptoms. \nCyclosporine eye drops were non formulary so will need to \ndiscuss with pharmacy in the morning regarding alternative or \nwhether patient may take her own meds. Continued eye drops and \nmouth moistener.\n\n# HTN: Chronic. Continued furosemide daily (likely for chronic \n___ edema). \n\n# GERD: Chronic in the setting of lower esophageal dysfunction \nfrom CREST syndrome. Continued PPI, substituted protonix for \nlansoprazole given non formulary.  \n\n# Limited Scleroderma\/CREST syndrome: Complicated by Raynaud's \nphenomenon, esophageal dysmotility, chronic pericardial effusion \nand pulmonary manifestations. Patient with sclerodactyly and \ntelangiectasias on exam. \n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\n- Warm her hands under hot water prior to receiving any reads of \nher oxygen level. Hypoxia determined to spurious, artifact of \nRaynaud's (ear and forehead do not work) \n- A calcium channel blocker may be indicated for symptomatic \nimprovement of Raynaud's, consider this at followup.\n- Mild worsening of pulmonary artery hypertension was observed \non right heart catheterization. Cardiac output improved with \nvasodilating agent. Findings were likely not enough to explain \ndyspnea but if this were to be progressive, consider pulmonary \nvasodilator in the future.\n- On CT chest: Multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules range up to \n4 mm in diameter, many of which are new since the prior CT from \n___. Follow-up imaging was recommended in 12 months by \nradiology. Will require 3 month repeat chest CT for mediastinal \nlymphadenopathy. Need for additional imaging of pulmonary \nnodules can be determined after that chest CT\n- Deferred starting night time oxygen therapy as home values \nlikely spurious, can be continue to be discussed as an \noutpatient\n- Followup with PCP and pulmonologist in two weeks. \n- Encourage exercise and ambulation.\n\n  \n\n# Code: Full  \n# Emergency Contact: Daughter ___ (cell) ___  \n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

You were evaluated with many procedures and imaging tests which showed no clear reason for your dyspnea and hypoxia. You were found to have a pericardial effusion and mild pulmonary artery hypertension, but not enough to explain your degree of dyspnea. However, we discovered that your Raynaud's was likely the reason for your apparent low oxygen, which was giving us false readings of your oxygen level.

She was found to have \nsmall stable SAH, altered mental status, acute on chronic\nhyponatremia, and ?UTI for which she received 2 doses CTX prior \nto a negative culture result. While she initially had an acute \ncomponent to her encephalopathy, this improved over several \ndays. She remained disoriented to place but was otherwise \norientated and showed no alterations of attention, so it was \nfelt that she likely had a chronic cognitive decline that had \nbecome more apparent in the setting of her hospitalization. \nUnclear whether she will be safe to return home and live \nindependently again after rehab course. \n\nACTIVE ISSUES:\n===============\n# Metabolic encephalopathy \n# Suspected underlying Cognitive Impairment \nDaughter reports that her mother is independent at baseline, \nliving alone, with only mild memory issues and occasional odd \nbehavior (trying to open mailbox with remote) per daughter, over \npast ___. She was initially acutely encephalopathic during the \nadmission but subsequently made some improvement. However per \nher daughter she appeared to remain below her baseline.  \nHowever, given persistence and unchanging nature of her \nconfusion (disoriented to place, but otherwise alert and \ninteractive), this is likely an underlying undiagnosed cognitive \nimpairment that was exacerbated by hospitalization for her fall. \nShe was treated for suspected UTI for 2 days with Ceftriaxone \nprior to a negative culture result. Her B12 and TSH were normal, \nRPR was negative. Mental status improved significantly from \nadmission, but she remained only oriented to person and time. ___ \nre-evaluation suggested that patient may be more likely suitable \nfor placement in ___ rehab. Ultimately, for her safety, \nshe may either need more intense home supervision or placement \nin a nursing home. \n\nHer home Nortriptyline was restarted at a low dose (20mg at \nbedtime) for insomnia\/depression. Her home Clonazepam was held, \ndue to the possibility of worsening confusion\/sedation (BEER's \nList medicine). Outpatient neurocognitive testing is \nrecommended.\n\n# UTI:\nPersistent UA with leuks and WBCs. Patient did not have urinary \nsymptoms, but given AMS she received 2 doses CTX 1g q24h. Given \nnegative urine culture, abx were stopped.\n\n# s\/p Fall \nPatient with witnessed fall in the elevator at her home \napartment. Per daughter, it was unusual that her mother would be \nin an elevator at 9pm, raising concern for mental status as \naddressed above. CT with stable small SAH. Iron studies wnl. ___ \ndegree AV block on EKG. Neuro and cardiac syncope workup was \nunrevealing. \n\n# Traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage\nPatient had a fall with a head strike, and a small SAH found on \nHead CT. Her repeat CT showed stable SAH and trace \nintraventricular hemorrhage felt to be due to redistribution. \nNeurosurgery recommended no need for antiepileptics or follow \nup.  Neurosurgery recommended restarting Aspirin 7 days after \ninjury (___).\n\n# Ketonuria\n# Malnutrition\nPatient with 40 ketones in urine, glucoses have been in mid \n___. Possible component starvation ketosis. Initial AG has \nsince closed. Serum acetone negative. Nutrition recommended \ndietary supplementation with shakes. \n\n# HTN\nBPs were elevated to the 160s-180s initially. Baseline per OMR \noutpatient notes appears to be 130s-140s systolic. Patient was \nstarted on an ACE inhibitor on ___, given her history of Type \nII diabetes and continued HTN, but was discontinued for \ndevelopment of ___. Her home Atenolol was continued and \nAmlodipine 2.5mg was started daily. \n\nCHRONIC\/RESOLVED ISSUES:\n========================\n# Hyponatremia: Resolved.\nHyponatremia has been a chronic issue for her, though it was \nacutely decreased to 125 on admission. She has been taking Na \nsupplements since ___ per last primary care note. Urine osms \nwere elevated, with an elevated urine sodium, consistent with \nSIADH, possibly due to head trauma in the chronic setting of \nmalignancy. Her TSH was slightly elevated, AM cortisol was \nslightly elevated. Hyponatremia resolved with fluid restriction. \nUnclear if nortriptyline may have played a role. \n\n# ___: Resolved\nCreatinine increased from 0.6 to 1.0 on ___, likely due to \nfluid restriction for hyponatremia and initiation of \nACE-inhibitor. Resolved to baseline with fluids and subsequently \nremained stable off IVFs once her PO intake improved. \n\n# Pancreatic Cancer \nLocally advanced pancreatic cancer stage III (T 4 N1 M0) status \npost chemoradiotherapy with gemcitabine and SBRT completed in \n___. Not currently on treatment. Follows with Dr. ___ \n___. She is due for follow up visit with him. Awaiting \noutpatient CT.  \n\n# DM:\nHeld home metformin. Patient given ISS inpatient.\n\n# Depression:\nSees Dr. ___. \n- Holding clonazepam due to her encephalopathy\n- Restarted ___ Nortriptyline at slightly reduced dose\n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\n========================\n[ ] CTA Abdomen: Patient awaiting CTA Abdomen (at ___ for \nfollow up of her known locally advanced pancreatic \nadenocarcinoma. Will need to reschedule CTA and obtain prior to \nhem-onc follow-up on ___\n\n[ ] Neurocognitive testing recommended as outpatient to further \nevaluate underlying cognitive impairment.\n\n[ ] Psychiatry medicines: follow up with psychiatrist (Dr. \n___ as soon as possible.

His MRI did show incidental bone infarcts in the distal \nfemur and proximal tibia, and orthopedics thought that these \ninfarcts were old changes and did not require treatment.

I did not speak to the brother but on my\ninterview with the patient he is fully oriented and logical and\nstates his brother is overreacting. He does admit that his PO\nintake has been rather poor and his brother has been concerned\nabout that. He denies headache, nausea,vomiting, fever, abd \npain,\npain anywhere, ___ weakness, urinary symptoms, diarrhea, cough,\ndyspnea, double\/blurry vision. In fact other than decreased\nappetite which he states is overall improving and he is\ntolerating some POs, he feels he is in his usual state of health\nand the only reason he is here is to get a staging MRI per pt.\n\nIn the ED, neuro exam was non-focal. Patient refused CXR and\nCT-Head. He was admitted for further workup. On my discussion\nwith him he states he refused those things because he knows he\nneeds the brain MRI anyway so he would prefer to just do that\nrather than do the CT in addition to the brain MRI and his\nrationale is quite logical. His vitals were stable\/normal and he\nwas afebrile. Other than Hct down to 31 from 37 in ___, labs are\nunremarkable.

He also\nreports that he has been more forgetful lately. Although he \nfeels\nthat his Bell's palsy has improved, his headaches persisted and\nhe was advised to have a brain MRI. This was performed on ___\nand showed numerous hemorrhagic and nonhemorrhagic lesions\nthroughout the cerebral and cerebellar hemispheres. The largest\nhemorrhagic mass is in the left occipital lobe 3.8 cm x 3.8 cm\nwhich demonstrates areas of hemorrhage of different chronicity.\nThere is significant vasogenic edema associated with this lesion\nassociated with effacement of the left occipital horn. Numerous\nlesions in the right frontal, right temporal lobes are also\nassociated with extensive vasogenic edema and mass effect on the\nventricles. The largest right frontal lobe mass is at the\nconvexity posteriorly, 2.1 x 1.6 cm. There are several \ncerebellar\nlesions with one of the lesion in the cerebellar vermis abutting\nthe fourth ventricle with partial effacement. Left thalamic\nlesion is also noted. A nonhemorrhagic lesion in the right pons\nis also noted. He was advised to urgently present to the ___\nand was admitted. On admission his WBC was normal except for\nhemoglobin of 11.8 and hct of 35.3. His Cr, lytes, LFTs, LDH, \nalb\nand calcium were normal. He was consulted on by neurology and\nneurosurgery as well as ID. NSU did not advised resection or\nother procedure. Neurology felt he could have an LP safely and\nthis was performed 3 WBC, 2 RBC, (78 lymphs and 22 monocytes)\nwith glucose of 64 and total protein of 238. He had a CT scan of\nthe chest\/abd\/pelvis which showed a subcentimeter one cm\nhypodense left thyroid nodule. In the posterior segment of the\nLUL, there is a large multilobated 4.4 x 4.6 cm mass. \nSurrounding\nareas of interlobular thickening and finger like extension are\nconcerning for lymphangitic spread. The mass abuts the left \nsided\npulmonary vasculature as well as extends into the left apical\nbronchus. The abd\/pelvic CT scan showed no evidence of \nmetastatic\ndisease. There were no suspicious sclerotic or lytic bone\nlesions. His CSF cytology returned negative. On ___ he\nunderwent bronchoscopy with biopsy of the LUL mass. This \nreturned\npositive for adenocarcinoma consistent with lung primary. The\ncancer was positive for TTF-1. There was abundant necrosis\npresent. The cancer was found to have no mutation in EGFR, wild\ntype KRAS, negative ALK translocation, and negative ROS1. On\n___ he had a bone scan which showed no evidence of \nmetastatic\ndisease. There was a subtle focus of increased uptake in the\nright posterior 9th rib without a correclate on CT scan, ?due to\nold fracture. He was seen by Dr ___ Onc and\nreceived whole brain RT from ___ (total of ___ \ncGy).\nHe tolerated his RT well. \n\n   ___ initiated treatment with carboplatin and pemetrexed\n\n   ___ He was seen by Dr ___ of the neuro-oncology\nprogram at the ___.

Dr ___ repeating his head MRI in 2 months.\nWe has also had repeat staging CT scan on ___ at the ___. \nThis showed that the dominant left upper lobe mass has decreased\nin size now measuring 20 x 25 mm (previously 40 x 42 mm).\nEndobronchial satellite nodules will also decreased. There were\nno new suspicious findings in the lungs. There was no evidence \nof\nmetastatic disease within the abdomen or pelvis.\n\nInterval history ___: at the time of his last visit on \n___\nhe received his ___ cycle of carboplatin and pemetrexed. He\nreports that he had no nausea, vomiting, rash, or mouth sores. \nHe\ndoes have fatigue and is unable to work at this time.  He has\nbeen taking nystatin for oral thrush qid. He has started his\ndecadron yesterday as instructed at the dose of 4 mg bid (to be\ngiven the day before, the day of and the day after chemotherapy\nto reduce the risk of pemetrexed skin toxicity and then as\ndirected for nausea prevention).

Overnight into \npost-operative day one he was noted to have hypotension and low \nurine output and was triggered for this. He also had rapid \natrial fibrillation at this time which resolved with Lopressor. \nHe was given 2 liters of IV fluids with some response in blood \npressure and urine output. In the morning of post-operative day \non, his hematocrit was 30, the drain output was stable, he was \nalert and oriented. He met with the wound and ostomy nursing \nteam for colostomy teaching. He was provided a ___ \ninterpreter throughout the day. Overnight, the patient again had \nlow urine output and systolic blood pressures in the 90's. His \nheart rate began to slowly increase. In the early morning, he \nwas noted to have rapid atrial fibrillation and hypotension with \na systolic blood pressure to the mid 80's. He was noted to have \nhematuria which developed overnight as well as some new right \nflank ecchymosis. The right drain output was rather sanguinous \nhowever, was not a concerning amount. A CBC was sent an his \nhematocrit was noted to be 20 from 26 the evening prior. This \nwas acute blood loss anemia related to recent surgery. The \nsubcutaneous heparin and PO aspirin were held. He was ordered \nfor 5mg of IV lopressor and 2 units of packed red blood cells. \nHe responded well to the Lopressor and was rate controlled. As \nsoon as the blood products were made available, they were \ninitiated by the nursing staff. Cardiac enzymes were sent as a \nprecaution and were negative. He was interviewed with a ___ \ninterpreter and was feeling relatively well, his chronic back \npain was irritating him however, throughout the morning this \nimproved. A post-transfusion hematocrit was ordered and was 23. \nAn additional unit of blood was given and the post transfusion \nhematocrit appropriately rose to 26.2. The patient remained \nstable and was started on sips on ___, post op day 5, and was \nadvanced to clears. POD 6 he was started on his home dosages of \nHCTZ and labetalol, although his Coumadin continued to be held. \nHe continued to have evolving ecchymosis over his abdomen and \ngenital area however, hematocrits were all stable and the bleed \nwas thought to have been resolved and the bruising old blood. \nPOD 7 he was tolerating a regular diet and out of bed ambulating \nindependently. Overnight he was found to be retaining urine in \nhis bladder with the bladder scan. He was straight cath-ed and \n700 cc came out of his bladder. Later on in the morning he \ndescribed a fullness sensation just below his umbilicus. He was \nbladder scanned again and was found to be retaining urine again \nand a Foley catheter was inserted. Again 700 cc of clear urine \nwas expelled, though the urine was found to have clots and later \nthe urine had a reddish hue. This was watched closely. A stat \nINR was 1.1 and his HCT remained stable, 28->27.8. His urine \ncleared up on its own and was clear yellow. He had several \nteaching sessions about how to take care of his ostomy as well \nas his Foley in ___ with an interpreter. He was breifly \ntreated for a urinary tract infection, however when the urine \nculture was negative, the Cipro was discontinued. On the morning \nof ___, he was doing quite well.

No acute intra-abdominal process.  \n2. No acute fracture.  \n3. A 1.2 cm hyperdense lesion in the interpolar region of the \nright kidney was not present on the prior CT abdomen, but was \npresent on the most recent ultrasound and most likely represents \na hemorrahgic cyst.  \n\n___ CT head:\nIMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.  Mucosal thickening \nin the left maxillary sinus and ethmoid air cells.   \n\n___ CXR:\nFINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung \nvolumes have \nincreased, reflecting improved ventilation or a stronger \ninspiratory effort.  Size of the cardiac silhouette remains \nenlarged.  The pre-described retrocardiac opacity could be \ncaused by a tortuous descending aorta or by a hiatal hernia.  \nUnfortunately, the lateral radiograph does not allow to make \nthis differentiation.  In addition, there is a small pleural \nscar that causes blunting of the left costodiaphragmatic sinus. \nIn almost unchanged manner, an area of atelectasis, potentially \nwith slight bronchiectatic changes, is seen in the lower aspect \nof the right hilus.  No right pleural effusion.  No pulmonary \nedema.  No pneumothorax. \n\n___ CXR:\nThere has been no appreciable change since ___ except \nfor development of very small amount of pleural fluid in the \nleft chest.  Right lung is entirely clear.  The heart is \nseverely enlarged, causing left lower lobe atelectasis, \nunchanged.  There is no pneumothorax and no pulmonary edema. \n\n___ CXR:\nCompared with ___, no definite change is detected.  \nEquivocal minimal new linear atelectasis and pleural blunting at \nthe right lung base. \nAgain seen is background COPD, with moderate cardiomegaly and \ncalcified aorta. There is upper zone redistribution, similar to \nprior, but no overt CHF. Also again seen is a small left \neffusion with underlying collapse and\/or consolidation.  As \nbefore, the right hemidiaphragm is slightly eventrated.  On the \nright, no focal opacity, consolidation or gross effusion. \n\n___ CT chest w\/o contrast:\nSevere cardiomegaly and tortuous elongated aorta are stable.  \nThere is no \npulmonary edema or pneumothorax.  Retrocardiac opacities have \nincreased \nconsistent with increasing atelectasis. \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ with h\/o systolic CHF (EF 35-40%), CKD (Cr 2.2), afib on \ncoumadin who p\/w weakness, cough, and diarrhea with dense \nretrocardiac opacity seen on CXR concerning for \ninfection\/aspiration.\n\n# Cough, Leukocytosis: Initially there was concern that the \npatient had developed a pneumonia. She had been treated with \namoxicillin-clavulanate as an outpatient prior to admission \nwithout improvement. She was treated here with 7 days of \nlevofloxacin (___) without much improvement of \nrespiratory symptoms in the setting of concurrent diuresis for \nCHF. She slowly improved with reduced oxygen requirement, \nreduced leukocytosis, and smaller opacity on repeat CXR ___. \nThere was no evidence of aspiration on speech and swallowing \nevaluation ___. Legionella Ag was negative. Given the ongoing \ncough and possibility that the chest XR retrocardiac opacity was \nnot a bacterial PNA, she was then treated supportively as though \nshe were recovering from an acute viral bronchitis given her \nongoing wet cough and mild hypoxemia. She achieved euvolemia on \nexam after diuresis and had persistent cough. Chest ___, schedule \nipratropium nebs, flutter valve, and cough suppressants were \ngiven. CT chest on ___ showed findings concerning for acute on \nchronic aspiration so she was put on aspiration precautions. \nPulmonology consult recommended no antibiotics for her \nconsolidation on CT, but rather to pursue aggressive pulmonary \nhygiene with flutter valve, chest ___, hypertonic saline nebs. On \ndischarge she was tolerating room air with Sa02 ~95%. Her WBC \ncount was still slightly elevated at ___, but had been stable \nfor days, and was thought to reflect ongoing aspiration \npneumonitis. She requires ongoing chest ___, work with flutter \nvalve and incentive spirometry at rehab. She was placed on \ndysphagia diet with aspiration precautions. She was empirically \nstarted on a PPI for GERD in case this was contributing to \ncough. \n\n# Atrial fibrillation: On coumadin for CHADS 2. INR initially \nsupratherapeutic and warfarin held for 2 days, then restarted. \nThe patient's baseline rhythm is AF, normally rate controlled \nwith metoprolol. ___ AM she had brief period of HR 110s \nrequiring extra dose metoprolol 12.5mg PO. Overnight ___F.  Received metoprolol 37.5mg PO, 5mg IV. \nBecame hypotensive to SBP 79 briefly, stayed in the 80-85 range \nfor several hours despite 250cc bolus x2.  MICU consult called \ngiven concern for hypotension.  The patient continued to mentate \nwell, tolerated lower BP well (baseline low ___.  No transfer \nto MICU, SBP slowly came up to ___ with HR 100-115. Most \nlikely her volume overload has led to increased atrial stretch \nand drive to RVR; albuterol may also be a component given \nsympathetic stimulation. Albuterol was discontinued.\n  Given concern that her CHF and borderline hypotension may be \nsecondary to lack of atrial kick, it was elected to DC \ncardiovert the patient ___ after starting amiodarone ___. She \nwas successfully cardioverted and remained in sinus rhythm at \ndischarge. She was continued on warfarin given the unknown \ndurability of cardioversion in her. She should have outpatient \nTSH and LFTs for ongoing amiodarone and will require dose \nadjustment as outpatient in the future after initial loading\n\n# Chronic Systolic & Diastolic CHF: Her dCHF is secondary to \nhypertension, and her systolic component is likely ischemic. TTE \n___ showed newly depressed EF with RV dilatation and WMA. \nPresented with elevated BNP although weight of 71.9 kg on \nadmission below last discharge weight (74kg). No obvious signs \nof pulmonary edema or lower extremity swelling, although per \nprior records the patient frequently does not display these \nsigns. Diuretics held ___ given poor PO intake and concern \nfor infection but diuresis then started when BPs stable. There \nwas difficulty being aggressive because of her borderline \nhypotension to the high ___ and ___. She was eventually diuresed \nto what was thoguht to be roughly her dry weight of 74kg \n(corresponds to last hospitalization). She was discharged on \nmetoprolol XL 50mg daily. She did not have sufficient room in \nher blood pressure to start and ACEI, especially after \namiodarone was begun. She was continued on ASA 81mg, metoprolol \nsuccinate 50mg daily, and simvastatin 20mg daily.\n\n# Diarrhea: Loose stools for 3 days (___). Noted to have \nbrown guaiac positive stool. C diff and other stool studies \nnegative. Started loperamide for symptomatic relief.\n\n# E coli bacteriuria vs CA-UTI: She was treated for a CA-UTI \ngiven that urine culture from a Foley sample was positive. The E \ncoli was fluoroquinolone resistant. She was treated despite \nabsent symptoms because she is an unreliable historian and her \nWBC was still elevated. She received 3days of IV ceftriaxone \n___, followed by cefpodoxime daily ___. \n\n# CAD: Last hospitalization in ___ with evidence of \ndepressed EF possible due to ischemic event. Cath deferred at \nthat time. Patient currently without chest pain, EKG unchanged, \nwould benefit from continued medical mgmt. She was continued on \nASA 81mg, metoprolol succinate 50mg daily, and simvastatin 20mg \ndaily.\n \n# CKD: Patient with stage III-IV CKD, Cr ranged between 2.0-2.8. \nRecent baseline around 2.3. Her allopurinol was reduced from \n300mg daily to 100mg every other day because of her eGFR.\n\n# Hypothyroidism: Continued levothyroxine 50mcg.\n \n# Gout: Continued colchicine and allopurinol, but allopurinol \nwas reduced from 300mg daily to 100mg every other day because of \nher eGFR.\n\n# Code: Full (discussed with patient)  \n# Emergency Contact: ___, sister; ___ \n___.  ___ (son) ___\n\nTransitional Issues:\n-she requires daily INR checks for several days post-discharge \nto ensure stable regimen\n-amiodarone was started at 400mg daily on ___, she will need to \nbe loaded to 10 grams and then her dose may be decreased by her \noutpatient cardiologist\n-She requires outpatient check of her TSH and LFTs in a few \nweeks to make sure amiodarone is not causing side effects\n-pulmonary consultants recommended outpatient PFTs\n-She video swallow study and speech pathology evaluation to rule \nout aspiration.\n\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

We performed a chest xray that did not show any signs of worsening heart failure, however, it was concerning for a possible pneumonia. We treated the pneumonia with an antibiotic called levofloxacin. You continued to have cough and low blood oxygen, so we gave you diuretics in case some heart failure was causing fluid to build up on the lungs. We also cardioverted your heart from atrial fibrillation to normal sinus rhythm, which succesfully restored a normal heart rhythm but did not help with your cough. We started a medication called amiodarone to help keep your heart in a normal rhythm. We performed a CT scan of the chest which showed emphysema and inflammation likely from chronic aspiration. The pulmonary consult team saw you and recommended no further antibiotics for pneumonia, and to try to clear your lungs with chest physical therapy, nebulizers, and to make sure you weren't aspirating liquids when you swallow. While you were here we also treated you with antibiotics for a urinary infection likely associated with a Foley catheter from when you were getting diuretics. Your anticoagulation with warfarin was continued."}

She \nwas also endorsing cough productive of green or bloody sputum as \nwell as dyspnea. Given her risk factors for hospital-acquired \npneumonia and MDR organisms, she was started on: CefePIME 2 g IV \nQ12H, Vancomycin 1000 mg IV Q 12H, Levofloxacin 500 mg PO\/NG \nQ24H. She was also started on Tamiflu, which was discontinued \nwhen influenza DFA came back negative. Blood cultures and sputum \ncultures were also sent. Interventional pulmonology was \nconsulted regarding the utility of stenting given her recurrent \ninfections and possible bronchomalacia. She underwent a \nbronchoscopy showing 98-100% collapse of her L mainstem \nbronchus. BAL and suction of LLL was performed and cultures were \nsent. No growth has been seen on blood or BAL cultures to date, \nand sputum culture grew only commensal organisms. The patient \nhas been scheduled for rigid bronchoscopy with placement of a \nsilicone Y-stent as an outpatient on ___. PFTs and a 6-min \nwalk test were performed as a baseline for post-procedure \ncomparison. She will follow up ___ weeks following stent \nplacement to reassess pulmonary function and determine whether \nshe is a candidate for permanent repair via tracheobronchoplasty \nwith mesh placement. At discharge she was afebrile with no \ncomplaint of dyspnea and infrequent cough occasionally \nproductive of yellow sputum. A PICC line was place prior to \ndischarge for continuation of a 10 day course of Vancomycin and \nCefepime as an outpatient. ___ follow up was arranged.\n.\n# Asthma: She was continued on her home asthma medications \nincluding albuterol, singulair, and advair. She was also given \nalbuterol, ipratropium, and mucomyst nebulizers for symptomatic \nrelief of her asthma. \n.\n# Anemia: No previous history of anemia per patient. Crits were \nstable this admission at around 35.  Iron studies were sent and \nwere all within normal limits. Reticulocyte count came back at \n1.6 indicating some degree of marrow suppression. IV Ig products \nare known to induce hemolytic anemia, however her haptoglobin \nand LDH levels were also within normal limits. Her smear was \nabnormal with 2+ hypochromia, 2+ anisocytosis, 1+ \npoikilocytosis, 1+ macrocytosis, occasional microcytosis, \noccasional polychromasia, 1+ schistocytes, 1+ burr cells. As she \nhas been taking many antibiotics over the past three months, \nseveral of which are known to cause anemia, and as it is \npossible she has had recent respiratory viral infections that \ncould have resulted in some degree of marrow suppression, \nsuggest outpatient follow up to reassess her anemia when not \nacutely ill or taking antibiotics.\n. \n# Chest pain: During ___ placement the patient reported the \nsudden onset of a \"fluttering\" in her chest and feeling like her \nheart was racing. She also reported mild chest pain that was \npositional and worsened when she was sitting up. The PICC line \nwas pulled back 1cm with resolution of symptoms. CXR was then \nperformed that showed PICC line tip located in SVC. EKG at the \ntime showed mild STD in lateral leads. The same symptoms \nrecurred several hours later, and a repeat EKG at that time was \nnormal. Cardiac enzymes were negative x2. She was monitored on \ntelemetry overnight. She was asymptomatic for the rest of the \nadmission. This episode was thought to be due either to a \ntransient arrhythmia induced by advancement of the PICC into the \nright heart, or due to tachycardia secondary to anxiety and \nalbuterol tx. \n.\n# Yeast Infection: On hospital day one she reported symptoms of \nvaginal pruritis and burning consistent with prior yeast \ninfections.  She was given a one-time dose of fluconazole with \nresolution of her symptoms by the following day.\n.\n# Urinary frequency: On hosp day one, she reported increased \nurinary frequency and voiding only small amounts of urine with \neach attempt. UA was sent. UA showed few bacteria without \nelevated WBCs or hematuria. Symptoms resolved by the following \nday. \n.\n#Post-nasal drip: She brought her home nasal sprays with her and \nused them as these medications are not on formulary. \n.\n# IgG Deficiency: Stable with outpatient infusions of IV Ig q4-6 \nweeks.\n.\n# Depression: Stable. She was continued on her home meds: \nWellbutrin 150mg, \nCelexa 10 mg.\n.\n# Mood disorder (?Cyclothymia). Stable, continued her on \nOxcarbazepine 150mg.\n.\n# s\/p thyroidectomy.

Diltiazem was discontinued \nand doses of metoprolol were held intermittently for HR <60.  \nFor the 48hrs prior to discharge he was in both sinus rhythm and \natrial fibrillation and rate remained mostly ___.  Given the \ncourse, it appears that is rate is somewhat labile.  Though \nfurther rate control may not be needed if her remains euvolemic, \nhe may need to re-start amiodarone if he has further episodes of \nRVR.  Pharmacy suggested that he does not need to take loading \ndoses of amiodarone if it is re-started prior to 50 days from \n___ and can begin 200mg daily.  He will follow-up with his \ncardiologist, Dr. ___ want to consider ablation in \nthe future.\n.  \n# Blood Pressure Control: The patient was intially borderline \nhypotensive, had orthostatic blood pressure changes and was very \ndizzy.  This was thought most likely secondary to dehyrdation in \nthe setting of gastroenteritis and poor PO intake as well as \nmedication effects and atrial flutter.  His record documents \nhistory of autonomic neuropathy, but no further information was \navailable.  He had complained of dizziness ___ after his prior \ndischarge and stopped taking some of his antihypertensives \nincluding lisinopril, amlodipine and isosorbide mononitrate with \nsome improvement.  Prior to this admission, he had re-started \nlisinopril. Furosemide was held on admission along with \namlodipine 10mg, but lisinopril and isosorbide were continued.  \nAfter volume repletion and rate control, his BP began to climb \nto SBP 120s-160s day of discharge.  On discharge, his furosemide \nwas re-started. If further control is needed, he may need to add \nback amlodipine.\n.\n# Abdominal pain: This pain was lower abdomen, dull and crampy, \nthought to be due to viral gastroenteritis and constipation. It \nwas found to resolve with passing gas and bowel movements.  The \npatient was continued on simethicone, acetaminophen, \nondansetron, and bowel regimen for symptomatic management.  He \nhad several episodes of loose stools on hosptial day 2.  \nFollowing this, he did not pass stool until the day prior to \nadmission, and at that point his abdmoinal pain resolved. He \nreported having a colonoscopy last year at ___ that was \nnormal. \n.  \n# CKD: He has known CKD likely from underlying diabetic \nnephropathy and hypertension. His baseline creatinine appears to \nbe 1.3-1.5, and he was 1.6 on admission with hyponatremia to 132 \nand realtive hyperkalemia of 5.2  With IV NS, the electrolyte \nderrangements resolved and his Cr trended down to 1.0. \n.  \n# DM: Followed FSBS and gave insulin sliding scale with \ncontinued home standing 70\/30 25 units BID.  His FSBS were \ntypically ___.\n.  \n# CAD: Has history of MI, wasn't taking isosorbide mononitrate.  \nThis was restarted, and he was continued on beta blocker and \nfull dose ASA while inpatient. He was ruled out for MI with \ncardiac biomarkers.  \n.  \n# Hyperlipidemia: Lipids ___ LDL 97, HDL 37, Total 197, TGs 343. \n Not currently on statin as outpatient. Should be considered by \noutpatient providers.\n \nMedications on Admission:\nMEDICATIONS: per Atrius and patient list\nMetoprolol Succinate 200 mg daily  \nFurosemide 40 mg daily  \nLisinopril 10 mg daily  \nWarfarin 5 mg daily  \nInsulin 70\/30 25units BID  \nASPIRIN 81 MG daily  \n\nPrescribed but not taking\nIsosorbide Mononitrate 60 mg daily  \nNITROQUICK 0.4 MG PRN  \nAmlodipine 10 mg daily  \n\n \nDischarge Medications:\n1. acetaminophen 500 mg Tablet Sig: ___ Tablets PO Q6H (every 6 \nhours) as needed for pain.  \n2. isosorbide mononitrate 60 mg Tablet Extended Release 24 hr \nSig: One (1) Tablet Extended Release 24 hr PO DAILY (Daily).\nDisp:*30 Tablet Extended Release 24 hr(s)* Refills:*2*\n3. docusate sodium 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO BID (2 \ntimes a day).\nDisp:*60 Capsule(s)* Refills:*2*\n4. insulin NPH & regular human 100 unit\/mL (70-30) Suspension \nSig: Five (5) 25 units Subcutaneous twice a day.  \n5. furosemide 40 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day.  \n6. warfarin 2.5 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO daily or as \ndirected.  \n7. metoprolol succinate 100 mg Tablet Extended Release 24 hr \nSig: Two (2) Tablet Extended Release 24 hr PO once a day.  \n8. lisinopril 5 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO once a day.  \n9. aspirin 81 mg Tablet, Delayed Release (E.C.)

You likely had a gastrointestinal illness and became dehydrated. We gave you medicine to soften your stools and help you pass gas as well as fluids through the IV to help this. You have had several episodes of fast heart rate called \"atrial flutter\" while you were here. We continued you on the metoprolol that you normally take to keep your heart rate normal. We also gave you a medicine called diltiazem to slow your rate, but this slowed your heart rate more than necessary and it was stopped. We monitored your heart rate for the past two days and it was mostly normal. You will likely need to start taking amiodarone again to keep your heart rate slow."}

Most likely due to decreased tube feeds and possibly \ninsensible losses with resolving PNA. Hypokalemia likely related \nto appropriate aldosterone release. Her TBW deficit on admission \nwas 3.2L, which was corrected with free water flushes via G tube \nover 2 days. Hypokalemia improved with po supplementation, and \nshe did not have EKG changes. \n\n#Leukocytosis: Patient also presented with leukocytosis with WBC \n20K. This was felt to be due to resolving PNA with an element of \nhemoconcentration. After free water flushes, her WBC improved to \n14 at discharge. CXR showed resolving PNA from prior CXR during \nadmission for PNA (___). Urine cultures were negative, \nand blood cultures were pending at time of discharge. CDiff was \nsent due to loose stool on admission but was negative.\n\n#Atrial fibrillation: Hospital course was complicated by afib \nwith RVR, which improved with increased home metoprolol po to 50 \nmg q6h and with IV metoprolol pushes during RVR episodes.  Of \nnote, patient has a high CHADS-VASC score, but per OMR during \nrecent goals of care discussion, anticoagulation is not within \nfamily's goals of care and was felt to be too high risk in this \npatient with prior hemorrhagic stroke.\n\n#H\/o prior hemorrhagic CVAs: non-verbal, quadriplegic at \nbaseline. Patient seen by wound team for recommendations (see \nworksheet for recommendation). \n\n___: Patient's creatinine on admission was 1.4, which is higher \nthan a baseline around 1 but improved from a discharge \ncreatinine of 1.9 from last admission. Her new baseline is \nunclear currently, as she was thought to have possible ATN in \nsetting of septic shock during prior admission.\n\nCHRONIC ISSUES:\n#CAD complicated by recent type 2 NSTEMI: started aspirin and \nstatin this admission for secondary prevention\n\n#Epilepsy: continued home keppra. \n\n#COPD: continued home ipratropium nebs\n\n#HTN: held home amlodipine throughout admission and at discharge \ndue to BPs around 140 and because metoprolol dose was increased. \nAmlodipine may be restarted if indicated.\n\n#H\/o constipation: continued home docusate, bisacodyl, milk of \nmagnesia, polyethylene glycol\n\n#NSTEMI on prior admission: EKG this admission without ST \nchanges. Continued metoprolol as above, and started aspirin 81 \nmg this admission as well.\n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES: \n- Please ensure adequate free water flushes, as hypovolemia is \nthe most likely explanation for abnormal labs; we recommend \n250ml H20 q4h\n- Check chem7 within 1 week of discharge\n- Home amlodipine discontinued during admission and on discharge \ngiven BPs in 140s \n- Home Lasix held throughout admission and at discharge given \nhypovolemia.

He \nreceived high dose Melphalan prior to his transplant. The \npatient became appropriately neutropenic and his ANC>500 on \n___. The patient was given GM-CSF and switched to G-CSF \nbecause he was possibly having fevers related to the GM-CSF. \nDuring his stem cell transplant, the patient required total \nparenteral nutrition because he was not able to tolerate PO \nsince he had severe abdominal pain and nausea. The patient's \nabdominal pain was controlled with a Morphine PCA. The patient \nhad watery, brown diarrhea and was found to be C. diff negative \nx 3. A CT of the abdomen showed typhlitis with colonic wall \nthickening in the proximal and transverse colon. The patient was \nstarted on broad spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin, cefepime, and \nflagyl) and micafungin for neutropenic fever and typhlitis. The \npatient's blood and urine cultures did not show any source. As \nthe patient's counts recovered, he was continued on flagyl and \ncipro to treat his typhlitis.\n\nOn discharge, the patient was given a dose of aerosolized \npentamidine (___). He was started on acyclovir and \nfluconazole for prophylaxis.\n\nGout: The patient has a history of gout and used prednisone and \nallopurinol as prophylaxis prior to his transplant. Normally, he \nuses colchicine. All of his gout medications were stopped during \nhis transplant. As his ANC recovered, the patient developed more \njoint pain in his hands and also right ankle. Clinically, the \narea was not erythematous and the patient described it as his \ntypical gout pain. The patient prescribed high dose prednisone \nat 40 mg for three days and then was asked to take 30 mg the day \nafter discharge and then to go to 20 mg after that. The patient \nwas able to ambulate on discharge.\n\nTyphlitis: The patient was diagnosed with typhlitis. He was \nstarted on the aforementioned antibiotics and as his counts \nimproved, his abdominal pain improved. He had acute worsening of \nthe abdominal pain and a CT of the abdomen\/pelvis was performed \nagain which showed improved typhlitis. He was continued on \nCipro\/Flagyl for 7 days post-discharge.\n\nChronic pain: The patient has a history of chronic pain and \npresented on MS ___ and Morphine. He was unable to tolerate \nPO and he was switched to a Morphine PCA. On discontinuation of \nthe PCA, the patient expressed that his previous pain regimen \nwas not fully controlling his pain. He was started on a fentanyl \npatch with oxycodone breakthrough. The patient was given one \nmonth worth of patches and 30 oxycodone pills. The patient's \npain was controlled for 1.5 days on this pain regimen.\n\nAnxiety\/Depression: When the patient was unable to tolerate PO, \nthe patient was taking ativan for his anxiety instead of \nclonazepam. On discharge, the patient was not given a \nprescription for ativan, however, he requested 30 pills of \nClonazepam\n\nPeripheral neuropathy: The patient has a history of peripheral \nneuropathy and prior to his transplant was taking Neurontin.

Compared \nto the \nprevious tracing of ___ the rate is slower. \n\nCXR ___\nIMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic process though the \ncostophrenic angles \nwere partially excluded. \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nPatient is a ___ homeless man with history of EtOH abuse, \nmyocardial infarction, cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation (not \non coumadin), hypertension, hepatitis B and C, who presented in \nthe ED complaining of left-sided chest pain, and became \ntremulous. \n.\nACTIVE ISSUES:\n# Chest pain: history suggestive of ACS (substernal chest pain, \nleft arm pain), but ECG showed no acute ischemic changes and TnT \nwas <0.01 x3. Pneumonia was unlikiely given the lack of fevers \nand CXR with no infiltrates. Most likely etiology is \ncostocondritis; resolved in the ED.\n.\n# Alcohol withdrawal: In the ED patient became agitated, \ndiaphoretic, and increasingly tachycardic. CXR was unremarkable. \nHe was given 3mg ativan, 15mg of diazepam for CIWA>10, and was \ntransferred to the MICU for management of alcohol withdrawal. He \nreceived B12 and Folic Acid. In the MICU he was afebrile, \nhypertensive to 161\/100, tachycardic to 114, and was somewhat \ntremulous and diaphoretic.  He was placed on Diazepam 5 mg PO \nQ1H:PRN for CIWA > 14. He was otherwise comfortable and stable, \nno longer reported any chest pain, and was speaking in full \nsentences, and was alert and oriented to person, place, and \ndate.  He was restarted on his home metoprolol and diltiazem \ndose, and was started on B12, folic acid, and thiamine.  The \nnext morning the patient was requiring less diazepam  (5mg \nq4H:PRN for CIWA>14) and was no longer tachycardic, \nhypertensive, tremulous or diaphoretic. He was therefore \ntransferred to the floor. On the floor he was initially \ncomfortable and stable, and his diazepam requirement decreased \nto 5mg q8H: PRN for CIWA>10. Social work was consulted given \nfrequent admissions for alcohol abuse. However, on the morning \nof ___ he was dissatisfied with his lunch and became \nagitated. Despite receiving 2 doses of 5mg diazepam q2H, he \ncontinued to be agitated and abusive to nursing staff, and \nstated in no uncertain terms that he wanted to leave.  The risks \nof leaving while undergoing treatment for alcohol withdrawal \nwere explained to the patient, including seizures and death; \nhowever, he insisted on leaving and left the hospital against \nmedical advice. \n.\n# Tachycardia (sinus): unresponsive to IV fluids in ED. Likely \ndue to EtOH withdrawal. Patient was placed on telemetry; home \nmetoprolol, diltiazem were continued; he received maintenance IV \nfluids at 100cc\/hr and Diazepam for EtOH withdrawal (as per \nabove).\n.\nINACTIVE ISSUES\n# Hypokalemia: admission K 2.7, possibly due to long-standing \nalcoholism accompanied by vomiting and diarrhea, as well as this \npatient's use of HCTZ and furosemide. K was trended daily and \nrepleted as necessary.\n.\n# Anemia, thrombocytopenia: Hct was stable in low 30___. Iron \nstudies (___) had shown Iron 203, TIBC 239, Transferrin 184, \nferritin 278, B12 407, folate 15.6. Plt 102, which is \napproximately at the patient's baseline. Both anemia and \nthrombocytopenia are likely due to alcohol-induced bone marrow \nsuppression, though on this admission B12 was wnl (308). CBC was \nmonitored; thiamine, folate were given daily.\n.\n#. Back pain: chronic for about ___ no surgical intervention \nper neurosurg (see last d\/c sum). Pain was controlled with \nlidocaine patches.\n.\n#. Hepatitis B\/C: alcoholic pattern. Has h\/o grade 3 fibrosis. \nOutpatient management was recommended.  \n.  \n#. Atrial fibrillation: not on coumadin due to risks with \nhomelessness. Patient reports receiving prior cardioversion. ECG \nis sinus here.  \n- Continue metoprolol and diltiazem  \n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES\nNone - patient left AMA.\n \nMedications on Admission:\nOne Multivitamin by mouth daily\nToprol XL: one 25mg tablet by mouth daily\nOmeprazole: one 20mg tablet by mouth daily\nHCTZ: one 50 mg tablet by mouth daily\nFolic Acid: one 1mg tablet by mouth daily\nVitamin B1: one 100mg tablet by mouth daily\nDiltiazem XR: one 120mg tablet by mouth daily\nFurosemide: one 20mg tablet tablet by mouth daily\n\n \nDischarge Medications:\n1. multivitamin     Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily). \n \n2. folic acid 1 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).  \n\n3. metoprolol succinate 25 mg Tablet Extended Release 24 hr Sig: \nOne (1) Tablet Extended Release 24 hr PO DAILY (Daily).  \n4. omeprazole 20 mg Capsule, Delayed Release(E.C.)

Both kidneys are echogenic, \nparticularly left kidney. There is no hydronephrosis of either \nkidney. On the right, there is a 2.4 cm simple cyst of the \nlateral upper pole. No renal calculi are present. The urinary \nbladder is moderately well distended, without abnormalities.\n \nIMPRESSION:\n1. No hydronephrosis of either kidney.\n2. Bilateral increased renal parenchymal echogenicity and left \nrenal atrophy, consistent with history of chronic renal disease.\n3. Simple right renal cyst.\n\nNEEDLE RENAL BIOPSY ___: \nCrescentic glomerulonephritis with low level IgG deposition in \nthe setting of hydralazine use and P-ANCA positivity, see note.\n\nNote:\nLight Microscopy: The specimen consists of renal cortex, but is \npredominantly medulla, containing approximately 4 glomeruli, of \nwhich 0 are globally sclerotic.  One shows a cellular crescent, \nthe remainder are essentially within normal limits.\n.\nThere is widespread interstitial edema and mild-moderate \ninterstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy.  Mild chronic \ninflammation accompanies the scarring.  Intact \ntubulo-interstitium show mild mononuclear inflammation, frequent \nred cell casts, and occasional interstitial hemorrhage.  Tubules \nshow acute injury, as well as proliferative changes.\n.\nArteries show moderate intimal fibroplasia.\n.\nArterioles show moderate mural thickening and hyaline change. No \nvasculitis is noted.\n.\nImmunofluorescence:  The specimen consists of renal cortex, \ncontaining approximately 4 glomeruli, of which 1 is globally \nsclerotic.  There is granular mesangial staining for IgG (1+), \nIgM (0-trace), C3 (1+), Kappa (1+), and Lambda (trace-1+).  \nTrace C1q is seen in vessels.  One glomerulus shows segmental \nfibrin positivity. 1+C3 is seen along tubular basement membranes \nand in vessels. Tubular basement membranes show no IgG \ndeposition.\n.\nAlbumin is non-contributory.\n.\nElectron microscopy:  Findings will be issued in an addendum.\n.\nComment:\n1.  Cortical sample size is limited.\n2.  The amount of immune complex deposition noted is consistent \nwith a pauci-immune process (here most likely hydralazine \nrelated), but does raise the possibility of a second, immune \ncomplex related process. Interestingly, hydralazine is also \nassociated with drug induced lupus like syndrome.  \nUltrastructural studies will be helpful.\n.\nClinical: Chronic renal disease likely due to HTN, on \nhydralazine for many years.  Unilateral renal artery stenosis.  \nPresents with anemia and ARF (SCr from mid 1's to 3.3).  U Pr\/Cr \n= 0.3.  P-ANCA positive.\n.\nGross: Received are needle core(s) of light brown tissue.  The \nspecimen is viewed in the dissecting microscope, identified as \nrenal by Dr. ___, and divided into material for light \n(formalin fixation) and electron microscopy and \nimmunofluorescence studies.\n.\nPAS and ___ stains were done to evaluate basement membranes - \nMasson's trichrome stains were done to evaluate interstitial \nfibrosis. \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ yo F with RAS, baseline CKD III, pAF, HTN presenting with \nacute on chronic renal failure who was found to have + P-ANCA \npossibly related to hydralizine.\n.  \n# Renal failure: Baseline GFR is 30 with Cr 1.6 and pt was last \nseen in ___. She presented to her nephrologist for \nroutine visit with no acute complaints, except for fatigue that \nhas been ongoing. Her Cr was checked was elevated to 3.3. She \nwas admitted for further evaluation. Calc FENA was 1.4 with \nUOSMS of 431 at admission, not particularly suggestive of \npre-renal physiology. Renal US shows no hydronephrosis, or \nbladder retention. Pt was producing adequate amounts of urine. \nSediment analysis reveled blood which was initially thought to \nbe related partially to ___ supratherapeutic INR. The urine also \nhad abnormal RBC morphology, no casts were seen. Lisinopril, \nhydralazine and sotalol were all stopped at admission due to \npoor renal function. She was given fluids with mild decrease in \nCreatine from 3.3->3.0 which she has stayed stable for the last \nfew days. She has been producing adequate amounts of urine \noutput. The serology returned positive for P-ANCA which is very \nsuggestive of inflammatory process, vasculitis GN. This was \nthought to be related to hydralazine.  Her renal biopsy was done \non ___ pt tolerated the procedure well with no \ncomplications. Post biopsy she was started on solumedrol 250mg x \n2 days, once the prelimary pathology report confirmed \npauci-immune glomerulo nephritis she was given 500mg of \nsolumedrol x 1 day. She was then started on prednisone 50mg PO \ndaily until she is further evaluated by nephrologist. Her \ncreatine remained stable at 3.0, but it did not decreased. The \nfinal renal biopsy shows 1+C3 along tubular basement membranes \nand in vessels. Tubular basement membranes show no IgG \ndeposition. The amount of immune complex deposition noted is \nconsistent with a pauci-immune process (here most likely \nhydralazine related), but does raise the possibility of a \nsecond, immune complex related process. Interestingly, \nhydralazine is also associated with drug induced lupus like \nsyndrome. Other labs such ___ and ANTI-HISTONE ANTIBODY were \nalso positive.  \n.\nShe was then started on prednisone 50mg PO daily and on \ncyclophosphamide 75mg daily on the day of discharge. She should \ncontinue these meds until she is further evaluated by \nnephrologist. She will need close follow-up and will need \nmonitoring of her CBC, electrolytes and creatine. She should not \nbe placed on hydralazine and caution should be used when using \nother medications that can also cause pauci-immune \nglomerulonephritis such as: propylthiouracil, allopurinol, \npenicillamine, minocycline. Pt overall states to be feeling much \nbetter by time of discharge her fatigue and poor appetite had \nimproved. \n.\n# paroxysmal AFIB: Patient was on sotalol for ___ years prior to \nadmission and this was D\/ced at admission due to \ncontra-indicated in pt's with GFR<10. Will continue to hold \nsotalol for now. Started on low dose metoprolol 12.5mg BID as \nrecommended by renal since unable to start other meds. On the \nday prior to discharge pt had an episode of A-fib with RVR with \nHR in the 120s she was given an additional dose of metoprolol PO \nwith good effect her HR decreased to 8os, she remained in A-fib. \nHer dose of metoprolol was increased to 25mg BID and her HR has \nremained stable in the ___. Her coumadin was initially \nstopped due to supratherapeutic INR and it continued to be held \nfor the renal biopsy, as recommended by nephrology her coumadin \nshould be held for total of 7 post renal biopsy due to the risk \nof bleeding. She was instructed to start taking her home dose of \ncoumadin on ___. I also spoke to Dr. ___ \noutpatient cardiologist, who she will be following up in 1 week \nand who manages her coumadin. She is scheduled to have ___ \ndrawn on ___ and to have results sent to Dr. ___. \n.  \n# Weight loss: per her report, seems to be undergoing a firly \nthorough evaluation as an outpt which until now has been notable \nfor some pancreatic lesions (info not in our system). She had a \ncolonoscopy and EGD in ___ that were negative, except for \npolyps that were biopsied and overall benign. While hospitalized \nshe had nutrition consult. She was given nutritional shakes with \nmeals. As per patient, her appetite had overall improved and she \nwas eating mod-large amounts of her meals. This may be due to \nremoval of hydralazine that was making her fell sick and the \nlarge doses of steroid that she received. Her fatigue had also \nimproved. She will need to continue to be closely monitor.  \n.  \n# Anemia: Likely ___ CKD. Iron studies not consistant with iron \ndeficiency or anemia of chronic disease. This is likely due to \nrenal failure and decrease epo. Hct sl lower than baseline of \nmid to low ___. Currently trending down at 29->26.8. No signs of \nbleeding. She will need to continue to have Hct monitored.\n.  \n# HTN: Pt had lisinopril and hydralazine held due to renal \nfailure. Her BP was slightly elevated with SBP in 160s-180s, her \ndose of amlodipine was increased from 5mg to 10mg and she was \nstarted on metoprolol as noted above. She was sent home on \nmetoprolol XL 50mg daily. Her BP was well controlled with SBP in \n130s. She will have close follow-up with her primary care \nprovider, nephrologist and cardiologist within the next ___ \nweeks.\n. \n# HyperK: Patient's K at admission was 5.6 with no changes in \nthe EKG. This was likely related to renal failure. She was given \nkayexalate and she was placed in low K diet. Her K remained WNL \nduring the rest of her hospitalization. \n. \n# FEN: She was initially given increase amounts of fluids which \nwas then stopped, regular diet (low Na, low K)  \n.  \n# Prophylaxis:  \n-DVT ppx: heparin SQ, given that she is off coumadin for renal \nbiopsy \n-Bowel regimen  \n-___ consult: pt ambulating independently in the halls\n.  \n# Access: peripherals  \n# Code: full  \n# Communication: Patient and her son ___\n.\n# ___: home with ___, I spoke to her son and \ndaughter-in-law who were trying to arrange for her to have \ncompany on the weekend post discharge.\n \nMedications on Admission:\nsotalol 80mg bid  \nhydralazine 25 tid  \nlisinopril 20 daily  \nnorvasc 5 daily  \nco-e Q  \ncoumadin 4mg 5x\/wk, 2mg 2x\/wk  \n \nDischarge Medications:\n1.

An underlying infectious infiltrate \nin the right lower lung cannot be excluded. \n\n___ TTE: The left atrium is normal in size. The left \nventricular cavity size is normal. There is moderate regional \nleft ventricular systolic dysfunction with basal to mid \ninferolateral and inferior akinesis. Views are suboptimal so \nregional wall motion could not be fully assessed. Right \nventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The \naortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no \naortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. \nThe mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. An eccentric, \nposteriorly directed jet of at least moderate (2+) mitral \nregurgitation is seen. Mitral regurgitation is not fully \nvisualized. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. \nThere is no pericardial effusion.  \n\n___ CT chest: 1. Moderate, mostly loculated, right pleural \neffusion and small, dependent freely layering left pleural \neffusion. 2. Dense opacity at right lung base adjacent to \npleural effusion likely \nrepresents atelectasis and less likely focal infection. 3. \nBilateral ground-glass opacities with septal thickening and \nbronchial wall \nthickening likely represent hydrostatic edema, but viral \npneumonia may \nproduce a similar pattern. 4. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy with \nthe largest lymph node conglomerate located subcarinally. \nAlthough potentially related to hydrostatic edema or infection, \ngiven the large size of the subcarinal lymph nodes, there is \nconcern for malignancy. Followup CT in 6 weeks after treatment \nof the patients acute conditoin is recommended. 5. Two nodular \nfoci in the right upper lobe may represent focal areas of \ninfection and less likely malignant lung nodules. These may also \nbe reassessed at the follow up CT scan. 6. Small amoung of \nascites is noted. Hypodense lesion in the upper pole of the left \nkidney likely represents a cyst. \n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ with MMP presents with VT storm and ICD firing, transferred \nfrom outside hospital for EP ablation.\n.  \n# Ventricular Tachycardia: \nPatient presented from outside hospital with VT storm, initially \nthought to be of ischemic etiology due to scar tissue. TSH and \ndigoxin level were within normal limits.  Patient had been \nloaded on amiodarone at outside hospital and was continued on \namiodarone drip at 0.5mg\/hr and beta blocker on presentation to \n___. On the night of admission, patient had frequent runs of \nNSVT, longest 15 beats, which started while he was sleeping.  \nWhile awake, patient reported feeling a sensation of \"warmth\" \nduring some of these runs of NSVT. He was started on low dose \nmetoprolol (both patient and daughter do not recall reason for \nlisted atenolol allergy) and amiodarone drip dose was increased \nto 1mg\/hr, after which frequency of NSVT runs decreased quickly. \nDuring attempted EP ablation of VT tract the next morning, \nElectrophysiology team was able to map out patient's left \nventricle and felt that VT was coming from right ventricle.  \nPatient reported having chest pain during EP procedure, so the \nprocedure was cut short, and patient was sent for Cardiac \nCatheterization with the presumption that his VT may have been \nof ischemic etiology. The patient had a PCI of the LCX\/OM with \ndrug-eluting stent, however, felt that this wasn't in the right \nlocation to be causing his VT. The patient had no further runs \nof VT and no further EP procedure was done. If he develops VT in \nthe future he may need his right ventricle mapped to look for a \nfocus of the VT. The patient will follow up with Dr. ___ as \nan outpatient.\n\n# Shortness of Breath: \nPatient experienced worsening shortness of breath during \nhospitalization, likely multifactorial.  He presented with two \nweeks of worsening productive cough and was treated for Right \nlower lobe pneumonia with broad spectrum antibiotics; only \nnormal oropharyngeal flora grew from his sputum culture.  \nPatient appears to have long history of hospitalizations for \nCOPD and CHF exacerbations with prolonged courses of recovery. \nHe was found to have a right sided pleural effusion on admission \nto ___ he was noted to have had this effusion in the past \nwhich was previously drained and found to be transudative.  \nEffusion appeared to be loculated on lateral decubitus films \ntaken during this hospitalization.  Patient's O2 requirement \nincreased post EP and Cath procedures.  He was thought to have \naspirated during the EP procedure, so flagyl was added to his \nantibiotic regimen.  Pulmonary embolism was considered but felt \nto be of low suspicion.  Lower extremity ultrasound was negative \nfor DVTs bilaterally. Ultimately, he was treated for COPD \nexacerbation with steroids, despite minimal wheezing on exam, \nafter which his symptoms improved. He was discharged home with \nservices on oxygen (which he had prior to this hospitalization).\n\n# COPD Exacerbation: \nPatient has prior smoking history, intermittently requires O2 at \nhome, usually with CHF exacerbations.  He has had multiple known \nexacerbations for CHF and COPD in the past with prolonged \nrecovery. His oxygen requirement was variable with up to 6L NC \nand a face tent. He was started on IV methylprednisolone and \nthen prednisone taper. His oxygen requirement decreased to 4L \nNC. He will follow up with his PCP ___ discharge for further \nmanagement. He was discharged with Advair.\n\n# Coronary Artery Disease: \nPatient was ruled out for MI at the outside hospital, and EKG \nwas without evidence of acute ischemia. Patient was continued on \nhome aspirin, statin, plavix, and beta blocker. Patient was sent \nto Cath lab immediately after having chest pain in the EP lab.  \nCardiac Catheterization showed three vessel coronary artery \ndisease, 100% stenosis of mid LAD but patent LIMA-LAD graft, and \nsignificant disease in the Left Circumflex.  The left circumflex \nhad 90% proximal stenosis before the origin of the AV branch and \nan 80% stenosis after the AV and before OM1, and was totally \noccluded distally.  A Drug-eluting stent was placed in the \nproximal-mid Circumflex. The \nSVG-PDA and SVG-OM were known occluded and were not looked at.  \nA femoral bruit was noted post procedure, not known to be old, \nbut femoral ultrasound showed no pseudoaneurysm or fistula.  \nPatient did have a couple of episodes of chest pain in the day \npost catheterization with no EKG changes; he noted that the \nchest pain was similar to pain he experiences at home sometimes \nfor which he does nothing.\n\n# Hypertension: \nBlood pressure was well controlled during hospitalization.  He \nwas discharged on his home low dose of tamsulosin, metoprolol. \nHe will follow up with his primary care physician for further \nmanagement.\n\n# Hyperlipidemia: \nHe was continued on Zetia\/Simvastatin.\n\n# Afib: Well rate controlled, currently A paced. On no \nanticoagulation although CHADS score is 6. He was continued on \naspirin and plavix.\n\n# CRI: At baseline 1.7. He was given mucomyst prior to cardiac \ncatheterization.\n\n# Diabetes:\nPatient was continued on basal glargine plus an insulin sliding \nscale during this hospitalization.  His blood sugars were \nelevated while on steroids for COPD exacerbation. \n\n# BPH: \nHe was continued on his home meds.\n\n \nMedications on Admission:\nLisinopril 2.5mg PO daily\nLasix 40mg PO QOD (last on ___\nKCl 10mEq QOD \nLantus 30U qhs\nNovolog 10U TID \nProscar 5mg PO daily\nFlomax 0.4mg PO daily\nParoxetine 30mg PO daily\nPlavix 75mg Po daily\nDigoxin 0.125mg Po daily\nASA 81mg PO daily\nZetia 10mg PO daily\nSimvastatin 20mg PO daily\nOmeprazole 20mg PO daily\nAmiodarone 400mg PO daily\nColace 100mg PO daily\nSenna 8.6mg Po at bedtime \nAmbien 5mg Po qhs prn\n \nDischarge Medications:\n1.

Speaking incoherently on admission, unable to answer \nquestions or follow commands. Differential included infection vs \nvasculitis vs seizure vs drug effects. EEGs x 4 had been \nnegative at OSH.  LP at OSH was concerning for encephalitis \ngiven bloody ___ tube from tap, elevated protein w\/ ~normal \nglucose, and lymphocytic predominance on CBC diff.  Patient had \nbeen started on vancomycin and acyclovir at OSH just prior to \ntransfer.  These were continued, and ceftriaxone and ampicillin \n(for listeria coverage) were added on arrival to ___.  In \naddition, patient had been on Zosyn at OSH due to intermittent \nfevers and concern for pneumonia due to possible aspiration.  \nZosyn was discontinued on arrival to ___.  HSV CSF PCR came \nback negative at OSH, thus acyclovir was discontinued.  CSF \ncultures were also negative, thus plan was to discontinue other \nantibiotics after 7 days.  Patient was seen by rheumatology at \n___ who felt that despite elevated CCP and rheumatoid factor, \nit was unlikely that patient's altered mental status was \nattributable to RA-related vasculitis given lack of articular \nfindings on exam.  In addition complement C3 and C4 were within \nnormal limits making vasculitis less likely, also MRA brain \nfindings from OSH were negative for evidence of vasculitis.  \nNeurology was also consulted given concern for seizure or \ndrug-effects as cause of patient's AMS.  Patient underwent \ncontinuous EEG monitoring, was negative for epileptiform \nactivity, but did show evidence of encephalopathy.  Patient had \narrived on 3 anti-epileptic medications (keppra, valproic acid, \nphenytoin) on arrival from OSH.  It was thought that these may \nalso have contributed to his worsening mental status.  Per neuro \nrecs, valproic acid and phenytoin were discontinued.  His mental \nstatus did slowly improve with discontinuation of these \nmedications, although was not back to baseline on transfer to \nmedicine floor.  However, was able to follow commands, was much \nmore alert.  Keppra was also titrated down with plan to \ndiscontinue prior to discharge. On discharge patient's mental \nstatus continues to wax and wane. He is easily re-directable, \nand has not been a behavioral issue. He occassionally calls out. \n\n# Epistaxis:\nWhile being monitored on the medicine service s\/p initial MICU \nstay, pt was noted to have large clots and substantial \nepistaxis. Given concern that his airway may become compromised, \nhe was transferred back to the MICU. ENT was consulted and felt \nthat the bleeding was secondary to nasopharyngeal source, \nalthough etiology not entirely clear as he was not scoped. ENT \npacked nare at bedside and adequate hemostasis was achieved. H\/H \nremained stable thereafter, and no transfusions were necessary. \nENT recommended keeping the packing in for 5 days, w\/ cephalexin \nprophylaxis while the packing remains in place. The packing was \nremoved on ? ___.  Given adequate hemostasis, they \nrecommended that anticoagulation not be held if pt required it.\n\n# Hospital-acquired pneumonia: patient was found to have \ninfiltrates on CXR on ___ after spiking intermittent fevers.  \nHe was started on vancomycin\/cefepime\/flagyl for a planned eight \nday course to finish on ___.\n\n# Seizures: patient noted to have 3 witnessed seizures at OSH. \nThought to be partial complex seizures. Was started on 3 \nanti-epileptics with no further seizure activity noted. EEG x4 \nnoteable for generalized encephalopathy, but no epileptiform \nactivity at OSH.  Neurology was consulted at ___.  Patient was \nplaced on continuous EEG monitoring, valproic acid and phenytoin \nwere discontinued per neuro recs.  No seizure activity seen on \nEEG, but was encephalopathic.  Keppra was titrated down and \ndiscontinued.\n\n# CVA: Patient reported to have acute stroke at OSH per imaging \nreads (right inferior parietal lobe).  However, on repeat read \nat ___ of images, ___ teams did not see any acute stroke or \nevidence of stroke at right inferior parietal lobe.  However did \nnote old small lacunar infarcts.  Patient was continued on ASA \n81 for stroke risk.  Also was on heparin drip due to LUE DVT \n(had this at OSH in arm with PICC), but LUE PICC was removed and \nre-sited to RUE. Pt also requires anticoagulation due to episode \nof atrial fibrillation with RVR noted at OSH.  INR was \ntherapeutic on ___, heparin gtt discontinued, and warfarin \ncontinued.\n\n# Atrial fibrillation: Patient noted to have episode of atrial \nfibrillation w\/ RVR at OSH. New diagnosis. Was started on \nheparin drip at OSH and rate controlled with metoprolol.  \nHeparin gtt and metoprolol continued at ___.  Was in sinus \nthroughout stay in ICU.  Warfarin was started and when INR was \ntherapeutic, the heparin gtt was discontinued.\n\n# C. diff colitis: patient noted to be c.diff positive on ___ \nat OSH. Was started on oral vancomycin at OSH.  On arrival to \n___ patient was continued on PO vanc, however, given patient's \nmental status, PO administration was problematic.  NGT was \nplaced, however became intermittently clogged while in ICU, thus \nPO vancomycin was discontinued and pt was continued on IV \nFlagyl.  Planned to continue IV flagyl for 7 days following \ncompletion of other antibiotics.\n\n# Hematuria: Patient with hematuria noted at OSH. Was evaluated \nby urology at OSH.  Hematuria thought secondary to intermittent \nfoley insertion (reportedly had foley removed and replaced \nmultiple times at OSH due to changing mental status).  Foley \nreplaced on arrival to ___, hematuria resolved without any \nspecific interventions. However, it reappeared during his return \nto the MICU and was thought to be ___ pt pulling at the tube. \nFortunately, it resolved soon after, and was not investigated \nfurther.\n\n# Rheumatoid arthritis: Patient continued on prednisone on \ntransfer to ___.  Seen by rheumatology while in ___ ICU.  \nPatient noted to have elevated CCP and RF, however, per report \nthis is baseline for patient.  Per rheumatology, patient without \nsignificant articular disease, thus unlikely to have \nextra-articular manifestations (vasculitis).  Complement C3 and \nC4 within normal limits - thus vasculitis as cause of patient's \nAMS unlikely.  Prednisone dose was 10mg at discharge which will \nbe managed by his outpatient rheumatologist.\n\n# LUE DVT: provoked, DVT occurred in arm with PICC at OSH.  \nHeparin drip started at OSH.  Was continued on heparin drip on \narrival to ___. LUE PICC was removed which caused the DVT, and \nPICC was re-sited to the RUE.\n \n# Malnutrition: patient with elevated anion-gap, urine ketones \nat OSH. Likely secondary to poor nutritional status. He had \nreportedly pulled two NG tubes out.  On arrival to ___, NGT \nwas placed.  Was started on tube feeds. Speech and swallow were \ncalled to evaluate patientt during second MICU stay but were \nunable to assess pt given depressed mental status following \nseroquel administration. When they returned to evaluate pt, they \ndetermined that he can take nectar thickened liquids and pureed \nsolids.  NGT was self-removed on ___, and was not replaced, \nas patient was taking PO without difficulty.\n\nINACTIVE ISSUES\n---------------\n# Hypertension: Pt has HTN listed as a problem in his past \nmedical history but is not on any standing hypertensives. During \nhis second MICU stay, his SBP was noted to be in 190s at times, \nwhich required prn captopril. While he responded appropriately \nto such measures it is unclear if he will require standing doses \nof Anti-hypertensives. \n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\n1. Antibiotics for HCAP until ___\n2.

He mentated well with normal \nlactate with BPs in ___. His goal MAP is 55 mmHg. \n[] Please consider referral to Psychiatry for management of \nanxiety and depression.\n[] Varices seen in the upper esophagus w\/o evidence of liver \ndisease on imaging and unremarkable labs. Consider fibroscan or \nfurther workup as an outpatient.\n\nMICU Course\n===========\nPresented after a fall. Evaluated by neurosurgery on arrival who \ndid not recommend surgical intervention. He was initially \nadmitted to the MICU for labs concerning for hypercarbic \nrespiratory failure. He was also hypotensive requiring levo fed \nbriefly. The Levophed was quickly weaned off. He was never \nintubated or put on BiPAP for his respiratory failure. His blood \npressures were persistently in the ___ systolic. He was \nmentating appropriately, with a normal lactate. This is assumed \nto be his baseline. He is s\/p prednisone burst for presumed COPD \nexacerbation ___ s\/p azithromycin 500mg x 3 days \n(___)\n\nWhile in the MICU, he was found to have tachy-brady syndrome. \nElectrophysiology, cardiac surgery, and interventional radiology \nwere all consulted. There was an attempted pacemaker placement \nfor his tachy-brady syndrome on ___ via an attempted \nR-femoral venous access. However, the pacemaker was not \nsuccessfully placed due to difficult vascular access. The \npatient was then transferred to the cardiology floor while \nawaiting multidisciplinary discussion between electrophysiology, \ncardiac surgery, vascular surgery, interventional radiology with \na approach as to how best to implant the pacemaker.\n\nFLOOR COURSE\n============\nOn the floor, there were continued discussion regarding how best \nto place a pacemaker. Consulting teams requested the operative \nreports of his prior surgeries so as to better understand his \nanatomy, however these unfortunately could not be obtained as it \nwas unknown where he had had these surgeries. Consulting teams \ncontinued to discuss best approach for providing patient a \npacemaker, with a tentative plan for access through his tunneled \nline or possible epicardial leads. He continued to be \ntachycardic to the 110s, as well as hypotensive to SBPs ___. \nHe triggered on the floor multiple times for unstable vitals, \nhowever continued to mentate well, and had normal lactate on \neach check. His respiratory status remained stable on his ___ \nbaseline NC requirement. Nephrology attempted perform HD while \non the floor, however patient could only tolerate 1 hr of \ndialysis due to significant hypotension. They stated they would \nnot pursue further dialysis on the floor given his hypotension. \nOn ___, patient began to have episodes of very symptomatic \nbradycardia lasting ___ minutes. He would temporarily lose \nconsciousness, have HRs in the ___, and then spontaneously \nreturn to his baseline tachycardia and mental status. He had \nmultiple episodes of this on the floor over the night, with the \nlast episode requiring a few seconds of transcutaneous pacing. \nThis prompted his transfer to the CCU. Patient's floor course \nwas also complicated by significant pain requiring breakthrough \noxycodone, as well as significant anxiety, which seemed to \nworsen his symptoms. \n\nCCU COURSE \n==========\nIn the CCU, patient was monitored while awaiting pacemaker \nplacement and continued to have several episodes of slow atrial \nfibrillation associated with episodes of presyncope. Through \ncombined efforts by ___ and EP, patient underwent ___ procedure on \n___ to establish venous access through the R groin into the IVC \nwith plan to undergo Micra pacemaker placement on ___. During \nthis procedure, ___ performed angioplasty of the R external iliac \nwhich was found to be occluded ___ scarring from prior access of \nthis vein. A dialysis catheter was placed as a placeholder to \nmaintain vascular access for pacemaker placement. During this \nprocedure, patient require both levophed and vasopressin to \nmaintain adequate BPs in setting of anesthesia. The patient \nremained intubated after this procedure and was maintained on \ntwo pressors while sedated. On ___, he had a permanent \npacemaker placed and remained intubated since his procedure \noccurred late. He was successfully extubated in the AM of ___. \nHe was weaned off vasopressin and levophed before transfer to \nthe floor. He was followed by Nephrology for HD. Of note, \npatient continued to have significant anxiety that was acutely \nexacerbated by his bradycardic episodes in which patient feels \nhe's about to die. Palliative care was consulted to help assist \nwith management of patient's pain and anxiety. He was deemed \nclinically stable for floor transfer.\n\n___ COURSE\n============\nPatient was transferred to the Cardiology service for further \nmanagement after CCU course. He was started on rate control with \nmetoprolol for his atrial fibrillation. BPs and respiratory \nstatus remained stable and volume was managed with HD as he was \ntransitioned back to ___ HD.\n\nSUMMARY:\n========\n___ man with history of CAD s\/p CABG, SVC syndrome and\nPAD s\/p right SFA stent, ESRD (___ HD), atrial fibrillation,\nchronic hypotension, esophageal varices, COPD on baseline ___\nO2, HTN, and HLD who initially presented as transfer from\n___ for fall at rehab c\/b subdural hematoma and\nrespiratory failure.

Per OMR, Ms.\n___ was found by EMS mid-day on ___ after her employer called\nthe police when she did not show up to work.  She had reportedly\ntaken 90 tablets of Klonopin (1 mg each) and extra strength\ntylenol and was found to have transverse wrist lacerations\ninvolving the arteries, though the time of ingestion or injury \nis\nunknown.  She was transferred to ___ in acute liver failure \nfor\nevaluation of liver transplant and surgical management of her\nserious wrist lacerations. She has now required two surgeries to\nrepair lacerated arteries in her wrist and then to address the\nclotting in the repaired vessels. She has remained obtunded,\nrequiring intubation until this morning.  LFT's are now trending\ndown and liver transplant is no longer necessary.

She does not readily answer questions regarding\nthe events leading up to her admission,and is difficult to\nredirect; instead, she consistently describes her past and \nrecent\nstressors with lupus and scleroderma, her job, and her son.  She\ndoes endorse feeling depressed in the recent past, especially in\nregards to symptoms secondary to lupus and struggles at work. \nSpecifically, she reports feeling \"very discouraged,\" describing\nthat her lupus has gotten progressively worse since it was first\ndiagnosed in ___ she now experiences a large amount of leg,\nhip, and back pain and reports she is embarrassed by the marks \non\nher face and the \"deformity\" caused by scleroderma, which she\nsays causes people to stare at her.  She states that she has\nfound that she struggles to perform to the best of her ability \nat\nwork because she is in too much pain and because her\nantidepressant and Klonopin make her excessively sedated.

Stable prominence of the ventricles, more than expected for \npatient's age.\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nPSYCHIATRIC:\n\n#SUICIDE ATTEMPT: The patient was transferred from the plastic \nsurgery service after a high-risk suicide attempt in which she \noverdosed on tylenol and benzodiazepines and made self-inflicted \nlacerations to her wrists. Please see discharge summary by Dr. \n___ for full details of the patient's surgical course. \nBriefly, her course was complicated by acute liver failure and \nmultiple surgeries on her upper extremities, including \namputation of her left hand below the elbow. On the surgical \nservice, she was followed by the psychiatry consult team. She \nwas noted to have a bright, inappropriate affect with poor \ninsight into her suicide attempt. She was started on a low dose \nof zyprexa (2.5mg qhs) with concern for hypomania. Patient \ntolerated this medication well. \n\nUpon transfer to the psychiatric unit, she denied any symptoms \nof depression or psychosis prior to her suicide attempt. She had \nbeen functioning well at work and had enjoyed a vacation with \nher roommate, ___. On the night before admission, she \ndeveloped acute pain in her left hand due to a flair in her \n___ disease. At that  point, she stated that she wanted to \npain to end. She impulsively took a large, unknown amount of \ntylenol and benzos and while intoxicated on these substances, \nshe attempted to cut her hand off. During her hospitalization, \nshe consistently stated that she was glad her hand had been \namputated as she would no longer have to endure pain crises. She \nminimized depressive symptoms, had a bright affect and was \nlooking forward to going home. She denied suicidal ideation \nthroughout her hospitalization and repeatedly stated that she \nwould not need to harm herself again because the hand was gone. \nShe was started on duloxetine (titrated up to 40mg) for pain and \nmood, and zyprexa was increased to 7.5mg qhs. She tolerated both \nof these medications well. She was also continued on ambien \n___ qhs PRN insomnia, which she had been taking at home. \nGiven her history of lupus, she was evaluated with neuroimaging \nand cognitive testing to rule out CNS pathology that may have \naffected impulsivity and mood and contributed to her suicide \nattempt. A NCHCT was negative and MOCA was normal. A referral \nwas made for neuropsychiatric testing, and they will contact the \npatient next week. At discharge, she stated that she felt safe \ngoing home with her roommate ___ and outpatient follow up. \nShe is scheduled for an intake with a new psychiatrist next \nweek. \n\nGENERAL MEDICAL CONDITIONS:\n\n#Chronic Back Pain\/Post-Op Pain: Patient was started on \noxycodone ___ q3h PRN pain. She typically took 10mg q3h while \nawake and was unable to tolerate decreased frequency. She was \ndischarged with a four-day prescription, at which time she will \nfollow up with the outpatient orthopedic surgery clinic. In \naddition to oxycodone, she was treated with gabapentin 600mg q8h \nand duloxetine 40mg daily (as above).\n\n#HTN: Blood pressure remained well-controlled. She was continued \non home atenolol 50mg daily. \n\n#Lupus\/Scleroderma: Patient was continued on prednisone 15mg po \ndaily\n\n#Tobacco Dependence: Patient was treated with a nicotine patch \n14mg TD daily. \n\n#Asymptomatic Pyuria:  Patient denied urinary symptoms. \n\nPSYCHOSOCIAL:\n\n#FAMILY MEETING: With patient's permission, SW contacted the \npatient's roommate, ___, who shared concern that patient had \nbeen more depressed since discontinuing her fluvoxamine \n(prescribed by her outpatient psychiatrist). ___ was unaware \nthat patient was in a state of mind to attempt suicide at that \ntime. Pt expressed regret for not alerting ___ to her \ndistress and stated her intention to seek help if she ever felt \nunsafe in the future. ___ shared that patient's mood now \nseems better and she sounds more like herself. \n\n#GROUPS\/MILIEU: Patient was visible in milieu and regularly \nattended groups. She stated that she enjoyed interacting with \nthe other patients and her treatment team. \n\n#AFTERCARE PLANNING: Patient declined to step-down to a partial \nhospitalization program after discharge, stating that she \npreferred to return to work. She has an intake appointment \nscheduled for outpatient psychiatry in ___.\n\nLEGAL: ___\nRISK ASSESSMENT: The patient's risk of self-harm is elevated by \na history of two prior impulsive high-lethality suicide attempts \nand apparently poor insight. She currently denies depressed mood \nand suicidal ideation; states that she is unlikely to self-harm \nin the future as the source of her pain, her left hand, is now \ngone. Protective factors include help-seeking behavior and \ninterpersonal support at home. At discharge, she was future \noriented, making plans for follow-up and going back to work, and \neager to return to activities she enjoys. Her pain is controlled \non current medication regimen.

Pneumothorax was confirmed on chest CT at the \noutside hospital and reconfirmed at ___. Thoracic Surgery \nevaluated the patient and noted that surgical intervention was \nunnecessary at that time. The patient's pneumothorax remained \nstable on serial chest xrays and the patient's dyspnea improved \nwith oxygen and management of his COPD\/emphysema.\n.\n# COPD \/ EMPHYSEMA: The patient was continued on his home \nregimen of inhaled fluticasone two times daily and \nalbuterol-ipratropium nebulizers every six hours. For \nbreakthrough dyspnea, an additional albuterol nebulizer could be \nadministered every three hours as needed. The patient was weaned \nfrom 4L oxygen upon arrival to his home dose of 2L oxygen upon \ndischarge. When admitted, the patient was on 30 mg prednisone \ndaily that had been started to manage a COPD flare prior to this \nadmission. This was tapered to 20 mg prednisone daily by \ndischarge. The patient was given detailed instructions on how to \ncontinue the taper and this will be managed while he is an \noutpatient. Both saline and fluticasone nasal spray were \nadministered to manage the patient's post nasal drip, with \nmoderate effect. \n.\n# ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: Patient had known atrial fibrillation \nmanaged with digoxin, verapamil and warfarin and had \nreappearance of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular \nresponse in the ___ ED. This was likely triggered by his acute \npulmonary process -- the pneumothorax and possible COPD flare -- \nwith possible contribution from missing doses of his digoxin and \nverapamil prior to admission. The patient's cardiac markers were \nnegative x2 and his most recent TSH was within normal limits \nmaking hyperthyroidism an unlikely cause for atrial \nfibrillation. The patient was maintained on 480 mg\/day total of \noral verapamil, but dosing changed from twice daily to three \ntimes daily dosing to maintain more constant systemic levels of \ndrug. The patient's digoxin was decreased from 0.25 mg to 0.125 \nmg daily given a borderline elevated serum digoxin level. \nTelemetry showed that the patient remained in atrial \nfibrillation but was rate controlled between 85-100 BPM. The \npatient was found to be subtherapeutic on his initial warfarin \ndose of 1 mg (INR of 1.1 on admission) and his warfarin was \nincreased to 5mg by discharge. His INRs will be monitored as an \noutpatient by his primary care physician.\n.\n# URINARY RETENTION: The patient has a benign prostatic \nhyperplasia and was maintained on his home regimen of tamsulosin \n(Flomax) and finasteride. He had a history of a Foley catheter \nin place for 2.5 weeks total, removed only 1 week PTA. He \npresented without a Foley catheter in place and had just \ncompleted a course of ciprofloxacin as prescribed by his \nurologist, but initial urinalysis showed positive nitrites, WBCs \nand many bacteria; however urine cultures did not grow out any \npredominant species. A Foley catheter was placed in the ___ ED \nfor patient comfort as patient complained of urinary urgency, \nfrequency, and straining. Because of concern for UTI, the \npatient underwent several Foley removal \/ voiding trials. \nHowever, post void residual bladder scans showed retention of \nbetween 500-600cc each time and the Foley catheter was replaced \nand remained in place upon discharge. The patient will be \nevaluated by his urologist as an outpatient for further \nmanagement of his urinary retention; an appointment has been \nscheduled.\n. \n# CONSTIPATION: The patient's constipation was likely secondary \nto a combination of decreased mobility and the high doses of \nverapamil needed to manage his atrial fibrillation. As \nconstipation was a likely contributor to the patient's urinary \nretention, he was placed on an aggressive bowel regimen \nincluding Senna, Dulcolax, polyethylene glycol, psyllium \n(Metamucil), and Colace (bisacodyl), with soap suds enema as \nneeded. \n.\n# NUTRITION: The patient's regular diet was supplemented with \ncalcium and vitamin D to treat likely decreased bone density \nsecondary to the patient's current steroid course. \n \nMedications on Admission:\nEnteric coated Aspirin 81 mg daily\nDigoxin 0.25 mg daily\nFinasteride 5 mg daily\nOmeprazole 20 mg daily\nWarfarin 1 mg daily\nPrednisone 10 mg TID\nSenna 2 tablets daily PRN \nAtivan 0.5 mg daily\nFlomax 0.4 mg daily \nFlovent BID (dose unknown)\nFluticasone (Flonase) nasal spray 50 mcg.\nHome oxygen 2L\nDulcolax 5mg daily as needed for constipation\nCiprofloxacin 500 mg twice daily x6 days (had just completed \nprior to admission)\n \nDischarge Medications:\n1.

Her outpatient cardiologist was concerned that \nshe may have contribution of heart failure as she has had \nfrequent CHF exacerbations in the past. She was admitted to \ncardiology service and aggressively diuresed with boluses of \nLasix 100 mg IV. After aggressive diuresis she underwent right \nheart catheterization; although PCWP was not able to be obtained \ndirectly, a calculated wedge was consistent with pressures < 20 \nmmHg, suggesting only mild-moderate LV dysfunction. She was then \ntransferred to medicine service. Dyspnea was thought likely \nprimarily pulmonary process and may be component of obesity \nhypoventilation syndrome plus asthma exacerbation in setting of \nrecently decreased prednisone dose. She was given prednisone 40 \nmg x2 and placed on slow prednisone taper. Dyspnea improved and \nshe was discharged on pred taper and home asthma regimen.\n\n# Chronic diastolic CHF: History of CHF exacerbations and last \nECHO showing EF>55%. Underwent right heart catheterization as \nabove. She was discharged on torsemide PO 60 mg daily and \nthought to be euvolemic.\n\n# Atrial fibrillation: New diagnosis in ___ but unable to \ntolerate metoprolol due to junctional bradycardia. Warfarin was \nheld for right heart cath and she was bridged on heparin gtt \ngiven renal function and body habitus not amenable to lovenox. \nPost-procedure warfarin restarted and heparin gtt discontinued \nwhen INR reached 2.0.\n\nCHRONIC ISSUES\n# CKD: Likely due to DM and HTN. Renal function remained stable.\n# HTN: Continued home hydralazine and imdur.\n# DM: continue glargine 35U daily, Humalog 10U with meals as \nwell as Humalog sliding scale.\n# Anemia: likely from CKD. Most recent labs are inconsistent \nwith iron deficiency anemia but rather anemia of chronic \ndisease. Anemia is macrocytic, but last B12 and folate levels \nwere normal.

Given your previous diagnosis of ulcerative colitis (UC), these symptoms were most likely the result of a UC flare. While you were in the hospital we performed an imaging study of your colon (flexible sigmoidoscopy) which showed inflammation of the lower portion of your colon (proctitis) consistent with UC. We treated you with steroids but your symptoms did not improve as we had hoped. At this point we began treatment with infliximab (Remicade) which you tolerated well and led to a marked improvement in your symptoms. You will be discharged on prednisone and also continue to receive infliximab. The single most importatnt thing you can do to prevent future episodes is to regularly take the medication prescibed to you by your gastroenterologists. This is critical even when you are feeling well. You should receive a phone call from Dr. ___ to schedule your next infusion of infliximab."}

The \nspleen, both adrenals, both kidneys, pancreas are unremarkable. \nThe patient \nhas a PEG tube in place. There is a small amount of free fluid \nin the abdomen. \nThe small and large bowel loops are unremarkable. No fluid \ncollections are \nnoted. \n  \nCT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: The rectum, sigmoid colon, \nbladder and \nuterus are unremarkable. There is trace pelvic free fluid. No \npelvic or \ninguinal lymphadenopathy by CT size criteria is present. \n  \nOSSEOUS STRUCTURES: The visible osseous structures showed no \nsuspicious lytic \nor blastic lesions or fractures. \n  \nIMPRESSION:  \n1. Mottled enhancement of the liver may be secondary to \ncongestion in the \nsetting of cardiac disease. Please correlate clinically.  \n2. No acute findings in the abdomen\/pelvis to account for \nsepsis.  \n.\n.\nCardiology\n.\nTTE ___:\nThe left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall \nthickness, cavity size and regional\/global systolic function are \nnormal\/borderline hyperdynamic (LVEF >55%). The right \nventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall \ncontractility. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally \nnormal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis. No \nmasses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. Trace aortic \nregurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly \nthickened. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. \nMild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic \nshadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be \nsignificantly UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are \nmildly thickened. Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. \nThere is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. [In \nthe setting of at least moderate to severe tricuspid \nregurgitation, the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure \nmay be underestimated due to a very high right atrial pressure.] \nThere is a trivial\/physiologic pericardial effusion. \n\nIMPRESSION: No echocardiographic evidence of endocarditis or \nhemodynamically significant pericardial effusion. Normal left \nventricular cavity size and wall thickness with borderline \nhyperdynamic biventricular systolic function. Severe tricuspid \nregurgitation. Borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension \n(may be underestimated in the setting of severe tricuspid \nregurgitation). Small left pleural effusion. \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nFROM ___. ___ in the ICU\nICU COURSE:\n=====================================\nAssesment: This is a ___ year-old female with a history of \ndementia who was transfered from ___ in shock which \nwas later thought secondary to pneumonia, possibly aspiration. \nShe was successfully extubated on ___ and weaned off pressor \nsupport. She was transferred to the ward on ___ from the ICU. \n.  \n# Shock: Patient met SIRS criteria with temperature, \nleukocytosis and tachycardia. Likely source was unclear although \nthis was most likely septic shock due to pneumonia despite \nequivocal CXR. She did have a moderately positive UA on \nadmission with ___ WBC and moderate bacteria which latterl, but \nthere was no growth on urine culture.  Cardiogenic shock was \npossible given the elevated CE but unlikely to be associated \nwith a fever to 104.  CT-head and LP were unremarkable. The \npatient received Vancomycin and  Ceftriaxone at the OSH. Her \nlactate rose to 3.1 on ___ and this decreased to 2.0 on ___. She \nhad a central line and A-line inserted and her hemodynamics were \nclosely monitored. She was treated with IV broad spectrum abx in \nthe ICU with Vancomycin\/Cefepime\/Ciprofloxacin and later \ncontinued on cefepime and vancomycin. She had no further fevers \nand she required inoptropic support with norepinephrine for \nhypotension. She was sedated with fentanyl and midazolam. Her \nWBCs were elevated at 13.7 on admission and with therapy this \ntrended down to 9.2 on ___. She was weaned off inotropes and \nreceived IV fluid boluses to maintain her BP. Given a possible \ncardiac cause, she received aspirin and her cardiac enzymes were \ncycled and were stable at 0.26. Echo on ___ showed no evidence \nof endocarditis or pericardial effusion with normal LV size and \nwall thickness with borderline hyperdynamic biventricular \nsystolic function in the setting of severe TR. OSH cultures were \nfollowed; we contacted ___ ___ (___) when \nall cx were still negative, csf neg, wbc 6, rbc 1, 2 sets blood \ncultures neg, no urine cx. BP improved, she no longer required \nfrequent fluid boluses, and she was successfully extubated on \n___. She was transferred from the ICU on ___. She was treated \nwith vanco\/cefepime for HCAP, as we thought she lived in a \nfacility, but it turned out that she lived at home. She improved \nmarkedly so we decided to keep her on an 8 day course of this \nregimen via PICC line. Her code status was confirmed with her \nhusband as being DNR but ok to intubate only while here as means \nto transition her home as we are able. \n.  \n#. Respiratory Failure: Pt was intubated after she was found to \nhave agonal breathing and was not protecting her airway. Her CXR \ndid not show a clear infiltrate but she did have LLL collapse. \nThere was no fluid overload or other acute process that would \nexplain her respiratory failure although given her presentation \nit was felt that this may have been secondary to aspiration or \ncommunity-acquired pneumonia. Her respiratory difficulties were \nmore likely due to decreased consciousness from poor brain \nperfusion secondary to her shock. She was successfully extubated \non ___ and maintained her saturations on 40% O2 with her ABG \n7.44\/28\/113\/20. She was closer to baseline post-extubation and \nwas stable on transfer to the floor on ___.\n.\n#. ___: Pt had elevated ALT and AST with normal AP and \nTBili.  This does not appear to be an obstructive picture and \nlikely represents shock liver. Tox screen negative. LFTs trended \ndown. Final CT A\/P read for signs of chronic liver disease \ndemonstrated mottled enhancement of the liver which may be \nsecondary to congestion. \n \n#. Anemia: Pt Hct on admission was 30.7. Unclear what her \nbaseline is. No evidence of acute blood loss and likely \ncomponent of Fe deficiency and chronic inflammation in the \nsetting of sepsis. HCT trended, stable. No transfusion \nrequirement. Maintained active T&S. Hemolysis labs negative.\n\n# Code status: Her code status was confirmed with her husband as \nbeing DNR but ok to intubate only while here as means to \ntransition her home as we are able.\n\n============================================================\nSINCE ARRIVAL TO THE FLOOR ON ___:\n.\nMs. ___ is a ___ y\/o F with PMhx of Dementia and \nquestion of ___ who was found unresponsive at home.  She \npresented to ___ in septic shock and was transferred \nto the ___ for further management. Of note, at ___, she had \nan LP to rule out meningitis (gram stain negative, WBC 5, RBC 6, \nprotein 47 and glucose 107).  She was started on pressors as \nwell as decadron, CTX and Vanco.  \n.\nIn the ICU here, she was treated with Vanc\/Cefepime for possible \nHAP (it was initially thought that she resided in a nursing \nhome).  She was extubated on ___ in the afternoon and \ncontinued to show clinical improvement.  Her course has been \nnotable for: NSTEMI with elevated troponins in the setting of \nseptic shock, with unremarkable EKGs, as well as radiographic \nevidence of LLL collapse.  A PICC line was placed for IV \nantibiotics and a family meeting was held (per documentation by \nDr. ___ and the family wishes to take Ms. ___ home \nwhen medically stable for ongoing care.  Her antibiotics were \ncontinued through ___.\n.\nOn the morning of ___, she was noted to have some myoclonic \njerking, leg jerking, eye fluttering.  Neurology was consulted \nand they felt these movements were likely in the setting of \nsevere metabolic disturbance and infection. Though seizures were \nunlikely, an EEG was ordered, and it showed diffuse\nencephalopathic changes of a moderate to moderately severe \nnature. It is suggestive, by virtue of the triphasic appearance, \nthat this is probably metabolic although it could be easily \nmetabolic associated with diffuse degenerative disease. No clear \nseizure activity was identified.\n.\nRepeat CXR on ___ confirmed ongoing LLL collapse.  It is \npossible that this this will improve with chest ___ and increased \naeration of the lungs. While this is most likely secondary to \nthe presumed pneumonia, the possibility of an underlying \nmalignancy was raised and discussed with the ___ son ___.  \n___ overall functional status is poor and performing a \nbronchoscopy would not be a trivial matter. Repeat CXR on \n___ was relatively unchanged, and we recommend another \nrepeat CXR in ___ weeks to confirm re-expansion of the LLL.\n\nLastly, her G-tube clogged several times in the last week of her \nhospitalization, each time responding to viokase +\/- bicarbonate \nper protocol. This was discussed with the ___ team, who \nrecommended changing her meds to liquid form when possible (the \nTylenol may very well have been clogging the tube) and \nincreasing her free water flushes. \n\nMs. ___ son ___ ___ was kept \nupdated throughout the hospitalization.\n\n \nMedications on Admission:\nunknown\n \nDischarge Medications:\n1. aspirin 81 mg Tablet, Chewable Sig: One (1) Tablet, Chewable \nPO DAILY (Daily).  \n2. docusate sodium 50 mg\/5 mL Liquid Sig: One (1)  PO BID (2 \ntimes a day).  \n3. senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a \nday) as needed for Constipation.  \n4. acetaminophen 500 mg\/5 mL Liquid Sig: ___  PO every six (6) \nhours as needed for pain.  \n5. metoprolol tartrate 25 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID \n(2 times a day).\nDisp:*60 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*\n6. acetaminophen 650 mg\/20.3 mL Solution Sig: One (1)  PO TID (3 \ntimes a day) as needed for pain.  \n\n \nDischarge Disposition:\nHome With Service\n \nFacility:\n___\n \nDischarge Diagnosis:\n## Septic shock attributed to community-acquired pneumonia\n## left lower lobe collapse: likely secondary to above infection \nbut need to rule out underlying mass\n## myoclonus of multifactorial etiology\n## hypoactive delirium of multifactorial etiology\n## Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation with borderline pulmonary \nartery systolic hypertension\n## Severe Dementia: fed through PEG Ttbe, lives at home with 24 \nhour caretaker and husband\n## ___, attributed to septic shock: resolved\n## acute kidney injury: resolved\n## NSTEMI in the setting of septic shock (Troponin peak 0.26)\n\n \nDischarge Condition:\nMental Status: Confused most of the time.\nLevel of Consciousness: Alert but not interactive.\nActivity Status: Bedbound.","summary":"You were admitted to the hospital with a very severe infection, low blood pressure and required special medication to help keep your blood pressure in a safe range.

He had cultures drawn and a negative xray. \n His home antibiotics, daptomycin and rifampin for his chronic \nosteomyelitis were continued and ID was consulted. Ortho was \nconsulted in setting of recent hardware replacement and ankle \nmanipulation.  He was taken to the OR the day after admission \nfor ankle cast removal\/replacement and suture removal. His \nwounds were externally examined and no evidence of \nworsening\/active infection in the RLE was appreciated. He had \nspiked a fever overnight after admission and the following day \nhis blood cultures, one set only, returned positive for gram \nnegative rods. He was started on zosyn. Cultures off his PICC \nonly from the subsequent day were also growing GNRs, speciated \nto Chryseobacterium indologens, sensitive to fluoroquinolones. \nHis PICC was removed, the catheter tip grew only candidat not \nalbicans. At that time the patient was totally hemodynamically \nstable on current antibiotics, with no further fevers, it was \nthought that his PICC had become contaminated with the yeast and \nGNR and he did not appear to be actively bacteremic\/fungemic. He \nalso had hip films to evaluate from hip pain at the site of his \nbone graft. His sutures from that site were removed, the films \nwere unremarkable. His pain regimen was uptitrated per \nrecommendation of ID given he had just been started on rifampin \nand this was expected to increase his pain medication needs.  He \nhad his PICC replaced after his blood cultures had been negative \nx 48 hours and he was discharged home on his prior daptomycin \nand rifampin with assistance from infusion nurses at home and \nwas counseled regarding PICC maintenance and avoidance of future \nline infection. He was switched to cipro on discharge for his \ngram negative line infection to complete a 14 day course. He had \nfollow up 2 days after discharge with his PCP and with his \ninfectious disease doctors in ___. \n \nMedications on Admission:\n1.

No recent \ntravel, immobilization, family history of thrombophilia, \nsystemic signs or records of malignancy. He denied any recent \nseizures and falls since ___ where he would have been down \nfor a prolonged period. Thrombolysis was not indicated. He was \nstarted on a heparin drip. TTE showed pulmonary hypertension \nwithout classic RV strain (did note some mild RV dilation and \nabnormal septal motion). He was judged not to be a good \ncandidate for the newer oral anticoagulants given multiple AED \ndrug interactions. Neurosurgery was not concerned about \ntraumatic SAH 6 months ago. We transitioned him to a Lovenox \nbridge to coumadin (initiated on 6 mg given warfarin levels will \nbe lowered by phenytoin and phenobarbital). We weaned him off O2 \nand at the time of discharge he had no subjective dypsnea at \nrest or with exertion, ambulatory O2 sats ranged 88-95%. He did \nnot meet criteria for needing home O2. \n\nGiven the high risk of recurrent PE after first unprovoked PE, \nwe recommended that he would need indefinite anticoagulation. \nHis recent fall was due to a seizure, so this will depend on \nfuture assessment of fall risk. \n\n# Seizure disorder: His phenobarbital level was within \ntherapeutic range, but phenytoin was subtherapeutic - 1.8 and \n1.6 on repeat. We did not adjust his dose as it had been \nincreased recently in ___. Albumin level was normal. Free \nphenytoin was pending at discharge. We discussed the importance \nof adherence to AEDs - he reported that he only rarely misses a \ndose when he is out the house, discussed that having a small \npillbox would be good.\n\nTransitional issues:\n===================\n- O2 sats noted to decrease at night - consider outpatient sleep \nstudy\n-Patient is being bridged with lovenox until therapeutic on \ncoumadin, please check INR on ___ to see if can stop lovenox \nbridge\n-Patient had low levels of phenytoin in hospital. After \ndiscussion with pharmacy this was not adjusted given the new \npotential affects of coumadin. He had a free phenytoin level \nthat was pending on discharge. He should follow up as an \noutpatient to determine if these levels needs adjustment.\n\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

These could \nrepresent small vessel ischemic sequela in the setting of \nunderlying hypertension or diabetes. There is no pathologic \nenhancement. There is no midline shift or mass effect. \n.\nERCP ___\nNormal major papilla. \nNormal pancreatic duct \nModerately dilated common bile duct and common hepatic duct. \nMany round stones ranging in size from 3mm to 6mm that were \ncausing partial obstruction were seen at the common bile duct \nand common hepatic duct. \nA sphincterotomy was performed in the 12 o'clock position using \na sphincterotome over an existing guidewire. \nA 5cm by ___ double pig tail biliary stent was placed \nsuccessfully into the left hepatic system. \nFree flow of bile at end of procedure.\n.\nRemain on oral antibiotics for a total of 5 days. \nRepeat ERCP in 4 weeks for stent removal and removal of stones \nin bile duct.\n.\nRUQ US:\nCLINICAL HISTORY: Patient with AIDS, hepatitis C, \ncholedocholithiasis on\nERCP. Status post sphincterotomy and stent placement. Patient \nstill with\ndelirium.\n \nSTUDY: Complete abdomen ultrasound.\n \nFINDINGS:\nThe liver size and texture are normal in appearance. There is no \ncoarsening\nor increased echogenicity within the liver to suggest fatty \nliver or\ncirrhosis. The contour does not appear nodular to suggest \ncirrhosis either.\nWithin the right lobe, likely within the segment VII near the \nhepatic dome, is\nan oval echogenic lesion that is not completely well-defined \nmeasuring 2.0 x\n1.5 x 1.1 cm. This does not demonstrate flow.\n \nThere are markedly dilated intrahepatic bile ducts. The left \nintrahepatic\nducts and segment IV intrahepatic ducts are filled with \nhypoechoic material\nconsistent with obstructed bile. The bile ducts, however, within \nsegment V,\nVI, and possibly VII and VIII, are filled with echogenic \nmaterial which does\nnot shadow, consistent with sludge and debris as seen on the \nrecent ERCP.\nMultiple round echogenic structures are seen within the \nextrahepatic bile\nducts where visualized, some of which are shadowing, consistent \nwith stones\nand sludge balls. The inferior most aspect of the CBD is not \nwell seen\nsecondary to obscuration by bowel gas and obscuration from the \ngallbladder.\nThe gallbladder is distended but is filled with sludge and \nstones. There is\nnormal gallbladder wall thickness, however, the gallbladder wall \nis striated\nand is edematous in appearance. There is no wall continuity \nevident. There\nis no pericholecystic fluid. The patient did not have tenderness \nover the\ngallbladder at the time of the exam.\n \nVisualization of the pancreas is suboptimal with only small \nportion of the\nbody\/neck visualized which does not show duct dilation. The \nspleen is mildly\nenlarged measuring 13.6 cm in greatest dimension. No focal \nsplenic lesion.\nBilateral kidneys are normal in size, contour, and echogenicity \nwith right\nkidney 10.4 cm and the left kidney 10.3 cm. There is slight \nlobulation of the\nright kidney. The renal parenchymal echogenicity is within \nnormal limits. No\nhydronephrosis. No calculus. There is suboptimal visualization \nof the aorta,\nhowever, its caliber within the visualized portions in the \nabdomen is normal.\nNo ascites.\n \nIMPRESSION:\n1. Marked intrahepatic bile duct dilation with the left biliary \nsystem and\nright anterior biliary system filled with subtle lucent bile but \nthe right\nposterior biliary system filled with echogenic material \nconsistent with sludge\nand debris. Extensive choledocholithiasis incompletely \nevaluated. The left\nbiliary dilation would suggest that the stent placed is not \nproperly\nfunctioning.\n \n2. Cholelithiasis with large amount of sludge within the \ngallbladder and an\nedematous wall. This picture could be consistent with early \nacute\ncholecystitis, however, the patient was not tender during the \ntime of\nexamination. Close followup clinically is recommended and if \nthere is concern\nfor acute cholecystitis, repeat ultrasound or MRCP could be \nperformed as\nclinically indicated.\n \n3. 2-cm echogenic hepatic lesion likely within the segment VII \nof the liver\nis fairly well-defined. This could represent a hemangioma, \nhowever, in this\npatient with a complicated biliary pathology, this is uncertain. \nIf the\npatient's condition worsened, CT or MRI could evaluate further. \nIf the\npatient's condition improves, an MRI is recommended within the \nthree months to\ncharacterize completely.\n \n4. No definite evidence of cirrhosis. Mild splenomegaly is \nnonspecific. No\nascites.\n \n5. Suboptimal visualization of the pancreas, but no duct \ndilation within the\nbody\/neck.\n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ old male, AIDS (CD4 20), has not cared for himself in \nyears, no meds except high doses of methadone for his substance \nabuse, and ativan abuse (off friends) but  none 2weeks PTA, \nincreasing confusion for past year, progressive, jaundice \nX3months, finally told his daughter he is scared to die, so she \nbought him to hospital (___) where he was noted to have CBD \ndilation and LFT elevation, so transferred to ___ for ERCP.  \n.\n\n# Choledocholithiasis, possible cholangitis: At OSH it was noted \npt had cholestatic elevation of LFTs and CBD dilation, so pt was \ntransferred to ___ for ERCP. He underwent ERCP ___, multiple \nstones noted in CBD, so pt underwent sphicterotomy\/stent placed. \nRecommended cipro\/flagyl X7days which pt received. Pt will need \nrepeat ERCP in 4 weeks for stent removal. Pts alk phos and T \nbili began to trend down to 2.0 by discharge, but alk phos \nremained elevated up into the 800s-900s. Per ERCP, this \npersistent alkaline phosphatase elevation is to be expected with \na CBD stent in place. RUQ US ___ comments on sludge in R \nbiliary tree, L biliary tree dilation, sludge\/stones in GB, and \nremaining stones\/sludge in CBD. Per discussion with ERCP fellow, \nplan will be to go back in in 4 weeks for repeat ERCP to clean \nout remaining stones. Given bilirubin has been trending down and \npts mental status has been improving,  ERCP did not want to go \nback in to do any further ERCP procedure at this time.\n.\n# Delirium\/Encephelopathy: Per family, pt has had ongoing \nconfusion for over a year, but worse over the past 2 months, \nunclear how acute his current delirium was. His worsening \ndelirium certainly could be his choledocholithiasis. He \nunderwent ERCP with stone extraction as per above and was \ntreated with cipro\/flagyl, but pt had acute episode of agitation \neven after the ERCP was completed and stones were removed. \nAdvanced AIDS brings up infectious, neoplastic, and AIDS related \netiologies. Note, TSH, B12 were normal. RPR was negative. He had \nno evidence of benzo\/ETOH withdrawl (tox negative on admission \nand daughter\/pt deny recent use; also, stable vital signs). \nUA\/CXR were unremarkable. MRI of the head was not impressive (no \nsuggestion of infection or PML). LP was performed on ___ and \nhad only 3 WBC, unremarkable protein\/glucose. ___ virus PCR was \nnegative in the CSF. CSF HIV VL was 1040. CSF VDRL was pending \nat discharge. CSF cytology was negative for malignant cells. Of \nnote, pt had acute agitation episode ___ am with a CODE Purple \ncalled, required haldol\/ativan and psychiatric evaluation. He \nwas calm the following day. Highest on the differential of pts \ndelirium and intermittent agitation is HIV encephalopathy. ID \nfelt that resuming ___ is the only chance for any reversal, \nbut resuming ___ was complicated by pts social situation as \nper below. Also, given pts h\/o Hep C, cirrhosis and hepatic \nencephalopathy was felt to be possible. He was started on \nlactulose as a trial to see if this would help with pts \nconfusion. RUQ US showed no evidence of cirrhosis or nodular \ncontour to the liver. Lactulose was stopped.  Pts mental status \ndid improve while here, possibly due to either ERCP with \ncleaning of some of the CBD sludge vs. lactulose. He was started \non ___ on ___ as per below. Pt was evaluated by OT, and pt \nhad ___ recall (although delayed), mild impairment in medication \nmanagement, and anxiety over performing complex tasks. It was \nfelt by OT that pt is safe to be discharged home alone ( he was \nable to say what to do in case of fire, in case of injury, etc; \nhe does not use the stove) as long as someone checks in on him \nand helps him with his medications. Pt will have outpatient OT \nhome visits and home safety eval.\n.\n.\n# AIDS: Pt had recent CD4 17, on repeat here was 70. HIV viral \nload here was 283,000. Has refused ARVs in past, even recently \nhad been restarted ___ but never filled his prescriptions. Pt \nnow expressed interest in treatment, especially given concern of \nHIV encephalopathy.  Pt is s\/p LP\/MRI as above to eval \nreversible causes and to eval for PML, CNS lymphoma, TB, \nneurosyphilis, etc. CSF cytology was negative, and culture for \nboth fungal\/bacterial were negative at time of discharge.  He \nwas continued on bactrim prophylaxis and azithromycin \nprophylaxis was started. He received nystatin for thrush. Upon \ndiscussion between pt, ID,and pts outpatient ID Dr. ___, \n___ was made to restart pt on Truvada and Kaletra. \nDiscussion between this hospitalist, pt, SW, and daughter took \nplace in which it was decided that pts daughter would need to \nbring pts ___ medications with her to pts house twice a day in \norder to ensure complicance. Meeting between this hospitalist, \nID, social work, pt, pt's daughter, and case management took \nplace,  discussing barriers to compliance. Pts daughter agrees \nto bring pts ___ meds directly to him twice a day under her \nobservation for at least the first several months. Pt also \ndiscusses sometimes having dysphagia and depression (causing \nbinges on benzos) which are barriers. See below for further \ndiscussion of these. The patient will need to follow up with ID, \nDr. ___, in 4 weeks for lab check and refill on his ___ \nmedications. \n\n# HCV:  LFTs elevated likely ___ choledocholithasis (alk \nphos\/tbili) but transaminitis may reflect chronic active hep C. \nINR is WNL, but albumin low at 2.5. Unclear if TBili elevation \nmay be chronic as well. HCV viral load was 5,360,000. Again, RUQ \nUS here showed no nodular contour to liver or evidence of \ncirrhosis. Pt will follow up with his outpatient ID doctor.\n.\n# Liver lesion:  Following pts discharge, pts final read on his \nliver ultrasound states\" 2-cm echogenic hepatic lesion likely \nwithin the segment VII of the liver is fairly well-defined. This \ncould represent a hemangioma, however, in this patient with a \ncomplicated biliary pathology, this is uncertain. If the \npatient's condition worsened, CT or MRI could evaluate further. \nIf the patient's condition improves, an MRI is recommended \nwithin the three months to characterize completely.\" Thus, would \nrecommend follow up MRI to further characterize this lesions. \nPts PCP, ___ be sent a copy of this discharge \nsummary as well as a fax regarding this finding.\n.\n# Social:  Difficult disposition as pt has not cared for himself \nfor long time exhibiting self-destructive behavior, now \nresulting in encephelopathy (?dementia) with periods of \nworsening delirium. Unclear how much is reversible. ID feels \nonly chance is ___ therapy but needs monitored setting to \nensure compliance. As per above, pt was assessed by OT and felt \nsafe to go home with supervision of his medication management. \nPts daughter has agreed to come to his home twice a day with his \n___ medications. Pt will have home ___, OT, and SW arranged at \ntime of discharge.  \n\n# Polysubstance abuse\/IVDU: Pt is on 149 mg methadone daily at \nhis clinic, confirmed. Pt received 140 mg daily while here.  \nAddictions was consulted, especially given pts abuse of ativan \nand need for ___ compliance. \n.\n# Dysphagia: Pt reports one of his barriers to taking his HIV \nmedications is having difficulty swallowing his pills. ERCP \ncommented on no strictures in the esophagus\/stomach. Per pts \ndaughter, pt has had a negative UGI series in the past. He has \nnot had difficulty swallowing his pills here thus far. Can \nconsider outpatient barium swallow to assess motility if pt \ncomplains of further dysphagia.\n.\n# Depression: Pt admits to feeling depressed, which causes him \nto binge on benzos. We discussed that restarting ___ may help \nsome of his depression. He will have social work visit his home. \nHe agreed to starting celexa, which he was discharged on.\n\n.\n\n \nMedications on Admission:\nmethadone 140 mg po qd\nSupposed to be on bactrim ppx, truvada, kaletra. \n \nDischarge Medications:\n1.

Her insulin regimen \nwas changed from 5OU to lantus and close follow-up was arranged. \nConcern for Munchausen Syndrome was raised in the setting of \nwitnessed sugar consumption and ultimate down-titration of \ninsulin requirement. \n.\nACTIVE ISSUES:\n# Hyperglycemia: Ms. ___ has difficult to control blood \nsugars, possibly secondary to insulin lipodistrophy vs. DMII \ndifficult to control s\/p pancreatectomy vs. Munchausen. She \ninterestingly responded dramatically from 500s to 300s with 10 \nunits insulin in the emergency department which was replicated \non the general medical floor, supporting a diagnosis of insulin \nlipodistrophy. However, the patient was also found eating sugar \npackets while having high blood sugars.  In this scenario, it \nwas difficult to titrate her insulin regimen.  She was given \nextensive counseling from the ___ consult service and general \nmedical team regarding glucose control.  A psychiatry consult \nwas placed given concern for Munchausen in light of her labile \nblood sugars, outpatient glucose regimen for concentrated \ninsulin, witnessed sugar packet consumption and multiple prior \nadmissions for hyperglycemia often complicated by diabetic \nketoacidosis.  The pschiatry consult felt there was \"no clear \nevidence that Ms. ___ was intentionally contributing to \nworsening of her illness; although she may have deficits in \nunderstanding the correct approach to managing her illness, and \nsubtle neuropsychiatric contributions could be considered.\"  She \nwas ultimately discharged on 20 units of lantus with a \nsignificant humalog sliding scale and close follow-up with both \nher primary care physician and ___ providers.  \n.\nIf she were to be re-admitted, consideration for an insulin gtt \nshould be made despite absence of anion gap acidosis for a \nbetter assessment of her insulin requirement in addition to \ndirect observation of her nutritional intake.\n.\nINACTIVE ISSUES:\n# Chronic pain: She has chronic migraine headaches, right face \nand arm complex regional pain syndrome requiring pain clinic \nnerve blocks, and chronic abdominal pain from pancreatitis. She \nwas started on sumatriptan in place of her home triptan not \nprovided through non-formulary, in addition to home gabapentin \nand doxepin. She  was discharged on her home regimen.\n.\n# Chronic nausea: Followed by GI as an outpatient.

Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system \ndemonstrated no angiographically-apparent flow-limiting \nstenosis. The \nLMCA, LAD, LCx, and RCA all had no obstructive disease. There \nwas \nhaziness in the mid LAD however. \n2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed normal right sided \nfilling \npressures with RA 5 mmHg and RVEDP 7 mmHg and mildly elevated \nleft sided \nfilling pressures with PCWP 11 mmHg and LVEDP 15 mmHg. There was \nmild \npulmonary arterial systolic hypertension with PASP 33 mmHg. \nThere was no \ngradient across the aortic valve upon careful pullback of the \ncatheter \nfrom the LV to the ascending aorta. \n  \nFINAL DIAGNOSIS:     \n1. Minimal disease in the LAD with some haziness that may \nrepresent a \nsite of plaque rupture with superimposed calcium. \n2. Recommend at least aspirin, and possibly clopidogrel. \n\nECHO ___\nConclusions\nThe left atrial volume index is normal. The estimated right \natrial pressure is ___ mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses \nare normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is \nmoderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction in the \nterritory of a mid LAD occlusion (see chart for details). The \nestimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L\/min\/m2). Doppler \nparameters are most consistent with Grade I (mild) left \nventricular diastolic dysfunction. Right ventricular chamber \nsize and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets \n(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and \nno aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve \nappears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. \nThe pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. \nThere is an anterior space which most likely represents a \nprominent fat pad. \n\nIMPRESSION: Moderate regional left ventricular systolic \ndysfunction c\/w CAD in the territory of a mid LAD. Grade I left \nventricular diastolic dysfunction. No clinically significant \nvalvular abnormalities noted.\n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ COPD (no home O2), CVT, anxiety, p\/w SOB and chest tightness \nat OSH, OSH course notable for ini of IV solumedrol for ?COPD \nexacerbation, IV lasix for ?pulm edema, also with new LV \nsystolic dysfunction\n\n# COPD flare - pt presented with SOB, hypoxia, increased \nproductive cough, most consistent with COPD exacerbation.  Pt \narrived from OSH at 4L, she has received doxycyline and IV \nsolumedrol at OSH prior to transfer.  Pt was transitioned to PO \nprednisone for ___s well as doxycyline for 7 day \ncourse.  Pt was kept on standing albuterol and ipratropium nebs, \nwhich was weaned down to prn.  Home advair was restarted after \npt finished the steroid course. Pt had significant improvement \nof breathing status.  On discharge, she was breathing \ncomfortably on room air with good O2 sat at both at rest and on \nambulation. She was discharged home with her home inhaler \nregimen and without her prior daily azithromycin dose. She has \nclose PCP and pulmonary clinic follow up.\n\n# NSTEMI with plaque rupture vs. stress cardiomyopathy vs. \ncoronary vasospasm - Pt presented with chest tightness along \nwith COPD exacerbation.  Troponin T was 0.2 > 0.03, MB was 11 > \n3. ECHO showed new moderate regional left ventricular systolic \ndysfunction c\/w CAD in the territory of a mid LAD. Pt therefore \nunderwent cath.  Cath however did not reveal significant \nocclusion thus no stent was placed. Cath however did find \nhaziness at LAD region, raising the possibility of possible \nplaque rupture.  Pt was discharged home with plavix and aspirin. \nShe was also started on a ace-i, beta blocker, and statin prior \nto discharge. Appointment was made with new cardiologist at \n___.  It is recommended that pt has follow up ECHO in \na few months to eval for possible resolution of systolic \ndysfunction given concern for potential stress cardiomyopathy in \nthe setting of COPD flare.\n\n# Sinus tachycardia -  Initially presented with sinus \ntachycardia, thought to be related to standing albuterol \ninhalers as well as anxiety.  OSH CTA was negative for PE.  Pt \nwas started on metoprolol. She was given ativan prn for anxiety. \n Tylenol was prescribed prn for pain.  Sinus tachycardia \nimproved with resolution of COPD flare and reduction of \nalbuteroil usage.  On Discharge, pt's heart rate was within \nnormal limits.  She was discharged home with metoprolol.\n\n# GERD - stable on home Ranitidine 150 mg PO\/NG BID\n\n## TRANSITIONAL ISSUE\n- ___ HAS BEEN ON CHRONIC AZITHROMYCIN, WHICH WAS D\/C'D THIS \nADMISSION\n- ___ WILL BE BENEFITED FROM ASA 81 LIFELONG AND PLAVIX FOR AT \nLEAST 6 MONTHS - ___ YEAR. DURATION OF PLAVIX SHOULD BE DETERMINED \nAT THE DISCRETION OF OUTPATIENT CARDIOLOGIST\n- ___ WILL BENEFIT FROM OUTPATIENT FOLLOW UP CARDIAC ECHO TO F\/U \nON SYSTOLIC DYSFUNCTION.\n- IT IS POSSIBLE HER PRESENTATION WAS CONSISTENT WITH VASOSPASM \nGIVEN NEW FOCAL WALL ABNORMALITY BUT UNREMARKABLE CATH.

There was also some concern that you may have a problem with your heart because of some blood tests and EKG findings. We did an echocardiogram which showed reduced heart functioning which raised concern that you had maybe had a heart attack. We then did a heart catheterization to see if you actually had evidence of narrow heart arteries which would have caused a heart attack. We saw some slight abnormality in one of the main arteries, but nothing that seemed to be responsible for what happened and nothing that we could fix with a stent. It is likely you had a blockage of that artery in the past and it has opened up a bit since. Alternatively, you may have had stress-induced cardiac dysfunction in the setting of your severe shortness of breath with your COPD flare. We will need you to repeat an echocardiogram in a few months with your cardiologist to see if your heart function improves. We started a new medication called plavix to help blood flow around this area if there is some blockage. You should take this medicine for ___ months."}

He \nwas admitted to the stroke service from ___ to ___.\n.\nAt the time of his arrival at the ___, a code stroke was \ncalled.  His exam had returned to baseline and he was given an \nNIHSS of 0.  To evaluate for contributory lesions, a CT of the \nhead and neck with angiography and perfusion was performed.  The \nimaging was thought to be normal.  To evaluate for evidence of \nstroke, an MRI\/A of the head and neck was done.  The studies \nshowed no evidence of acute infarction and no evidence of \nvascular occlusion, stenosis or aneurysm greater than 3 mm in \nsize. \n.\nA transthoracic echocardiogram was performed to evaluate for \ncardiac contributions to the patient's symptom complex. The \nfinal report was pending at the time of discharge.  It was \nrecommended that he take asprirn 325 mg by mouth daily pending \nthe results of the study.\n.\nTo evaluate modifiable risk factors for stroke, lipids and \nglycosylated hemoglobin were measured.  As the LDL was found to \nbe 92, no changes were made to the statin dosing.  Although the \nHBA1C was 5.4 %, blood glucose was monitored regularly and an \ninsulin sliding scale was instituted to maintain normoglycemia.\n.\nAs there was some concern that the episode could have been a \nseizure, an EEG was done.  Although the final report was pending \nat the time of discharge, an initial interpretation was \nessentially normal.  For his safety, however, it was suggested \nthat he refrain from driving at least until the results of the \ninvestigative bloodwork return.\n.\nUpon further interview, the patient volunteered that he might \nhave taken 1.5 tabs of ambien (rather than 1.5 tabs of \npravastatin) by mistake on the morning of the event.  An ambien \nlevel was added to outside hospital labwork and sent out from \nthe ___ as well.  In the absence of other clear etiologies, \nand the nature of the presenting syndrome, it is thought that \nthe effects of medication could account for the symptoms.\n.\nThe patient was discharged home.\n  \n\n \nMedications on Admission:\nMedications - \nASA 81\nCa\/VitD\nPrilosec 20\nAlbuterol prn\nAmbien prn sleep\n.\nAllergies- none\n\n \nDischarge Medications:\n1.

No significant valvular disease seen. \nNormal estimated intracardiac filling pressures with high \ncardiac output.  \n.\nCT head: IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process. Fluid within \nthe sinuses as above, most likely due to intubation. \n.\nRenal ultrasound: IMPRESSION: No evidence of renal obstruction.\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ male w\/ h\/o substance abuse and depression, found altered, \nhypothermic and hypotensive.  After his ICU admission he was \ntransferred to the floor in stable condition although his \ncreatinine continued to rise.  After that improved with no \nintervention other than diuresis, he was discharged in stable \ncondition to a shelter for help with his polysubstance \ndependency issues.\n.\n# Altered mental status: Most likely secondary to an ingestion. \nPatient later admitted to heroin ingestion. Percocet and \nOxycontin bottles found in his room. Urine tox positive for \nopiates (on a screen that does not detect oxycodone) and \ncocaine. Other possibilities would be sepsis, post-ictal phase, \ntoxic\/metabolic encephalopathy, hepatic or renal encephalopathy. \nToxicology was consulted and thought this could be due to \ntylenol overdose or cocaine in setting of elvated LFTs, although \nOSH tylenol was negative. Patient started on ___ protocol and \ncompleted with resolution of LFTs. Patient mental status cleared \nby the time patient was tranferred to the floor. Patient states \nhis only ingestion leading up to admission was his home vicodin, \nheroin (inhaled) and clonipin. Patient MS continued to improve \nbut in setting of worsening renal failure, patient carefully \nmonitered for uremic encephalopathy.  On the floor the patients \nmental status returned to normal, labs improved and the patient \nwas discharged with a normal mental status.\n.\n# Hypotension\/hypothermia: Differential originally included drug \noverdose, hypovolemia and overwhelming infection. Patient had no \nsource of infection as CXR and lung exam clear, UA negative, no \nabdominal pain therefore antbiotics were withheld. Per \ntoxicology, differential of ingestion in setting of initial \nbradycardia includes calcium channel blockers, beta blockers and \ndigoxin. Patient had no change in blood sugars and his digoxin \nlevel was negative. Patient was continued on IVF wide open, \nespecially in setting of rhabdo. Patient was eventually weaned \nfrom pressors that were started in the MICU. Once patient had \nstable BP for 24hrs, patient was transferred to the floor. \nPatient continued to have stable blood pressures for the rest of \nhis admission. \n.\n# Transaminitis: Most likely due such as Tylenol vs shock liver. \nStarted on N-Acetylcysteine in ED, received full course. Believe \nthat LFTs could have been elevated with acute tylenol overdose \nbut hypoperfusion is more likely especially as patient has signs \nof hypoperfusion with his kidneys with evidence of ATN. LFTs \ncontinue to downtrend. INR continues to downtrend as well. At \ntime of discharge his LFTs had normalized, his INR was baseline \nand he did not require further checks of his LFTs.\n.\n# Rhabdomyolysis: Appears to be localized primarily to his lower \nextremities. Could be cocaine, an exercise supplement, or \nprolonged period down. Patient started on aggressive fluid \nresuscitation for his first few days in the MICU. Patient \ncontinued to have downtrending CK with eventual DC of fluids \nespecially in the setting of worsening renal failure.\n.\n# Acute renal failure: Likely a combination of hypovolemia \n(hypoperfusion) and rhabdomyolysis. Patient aggressively fluid \nresuscitated as above, with down trending CK. Urinalysis showed \nevidence of muddy brown casts consistent with ATN, most likely \ndue to hypoperfusion. Renal ultrasound was negative for any \nother acute process. Patient creatinine continued to trend up, \nas well as BUN. Patient was hypervolemic on examination and per \nrenal given large dose lasix to try to improve kidney function. \nPatient was monitered for signs of uremic encephalopathy. \nPatient also had increasing anion gap most likely due to uremia. \nPatient was followed by nephrology and did not require any HD as \nhe reached plateau and then began having downtrending creatinine \nwhich was siginificantly improved at the time of disposition.  \nUrine output remained excellent\n.\n# Elevated lipase: Likely from hypotension, never c\/o abdominal \npain. Lipase trended down with fluid resuscitation.\n.\n# Elevated troponin: Likely from overall hypoperfusion. EKG was \nreassuring. Enzymes were trended and came down without EKG \nchanges. \n.\n# Depression\/substance abuse: Patient has hx of severe \ndepression. It was unclear if patient had suicide attempt. Per \nfamily, patient's depression has been getting more severe and in \nturn his drug abuse more frequent. Social work was involved in \npatient's care early. Once patient's sensorium cleared, patient \nevaluated by psych who thought the patient was stable from a \npsychiatric point of view.  He will be discharged to a shelter \nwhere he can continue his rehabilitation.\n.\nTransitional care:\n1. CODE: Full\n2. Medication changes: No longer on anti-depressants\n3.

Another possible etiology of these events is \nfaciobrachial dystonic seizures, though the semiology is \nsomewhat atypical and less likely given her improvement with \nantiepileptic agents. She was started on Keppra and it was \nuptitrated to 1500mg BID. She was also started on Vimpat after \nan episode, then EEG was started and she had no further \nepisodes. The EEG showed diffuse encephalopathy. MRI at OSH was \nWNL and was not repeated. She had improvement in her \nencephalopathy, and she returned to baseline by her discharge. \nLP performed ___ to evaluate for paraneoplastic, infectious, \nautoimmune\/LGI-1 encephalitis. Basic LP studies were within \nnormal limits, and encephalitis panel and neoplastic workup is \npending (we will call patient if abnormal results). She did have \na rash noted ___, concerning for a drug reaction to Vimpat. \nHowever, her family felt that the rash might have been due to \nthe blood pressure cuff. Vimpat was held ___ and she was \nmonitored without any seizure overnight. \n\n___ \n- ___ acquired delirium is the most likely etiology given \nseveral days in hospital and ICU as well as several doses of \ndeliriogenic lorazepam, which had been given to treat seizure. \nDelerium precautions were instituted, and we tried to let her \nsleep through the night with fewer interrupations. Her mental \nstatus continued to improve during her stay in the hospital. \n\n#Diabetes\n- At home, she has been using an insulin pump for ___ years, and \nfollows with an endocrinologist as an outpatient. Because of the \nchange in her mental status, her insulin pump was turned off and \nwe continued with subq insulin. ___ was consulted for \nmanagement of her diabetes. She had an episode of hypoglycemia \n___ after she ate a small lunch. Patient and family were \ncounseled regarding insulin use with meals. If she eats <50% of \nher meals, she should be given 6U of insulin, and if she eats \n>50% of her meal she should get the full 13 units. Her sister is \na nurse, and that is who ___ be living with.

Admitted to the hospital tachy to the 150's at times.  \nPt was placed on an amiodorone drip per attending recs with \nresolution overnight of HR to the 110's but still in A Fib.  Pt \nis chronically on Warfarin as she is s\/p valvuloplasty and she \nhad been therapeutic for the most part but we decided to perform \na TEE anyway prior to cardioversion.  Subsequently she underwent \nTEE that showed no intracardiac thrombus.  She was then \nelectrically cardioverted with resolution of rhythm to NSR, rate \nin the 80's.   She was sent on Amiodorone 200 mg BID x 1 week \nthen daily for one month.  She was set up with close cardiology \nfollow up.\n   \n# Coronary Artery Disease: S\/p 4 Vessel CABG ___ years ago.  \nCurrent status unknown.

Stable during \nthis admission.\n  \n# Vasculitis: Pt recently underwent extensive work up which \nculminated in the diagnosis of pauci-immune ANCA-associated \nvasculitis.  This issue was not addressed during this admission \nand pt was continued on Prednisone and Atovaquone.\n  \nTransitional Issues:\n1. Warfarin dosing on amiodorone should be addressed.  Patient \nwill likely need a reduction in her warfarin dosing (by ___ \nper pharmacy) given the interaction between warfarin and \namiodorone.  This was discussed with pharmacy and usually the \ndose reduction is not needed until the patient has been on \namiodorone for at least 1 week.

However, her \nnumbness did not resolve during her hospitalization. This was \nthought to be more consistent with a small ischemic stroke, for \nwhich she has numerous risk factors. Her MRI however showed no \nstroke. She underwent a stroke workup which was largely \nunremarkable, although was significant for a patent foramen \novale and small (2mm) infundibulum of the basilar artery. Her \nHBA1c was 5.1%. B12 was above assay; she continued her home B12. \nShe continued aspirin and high potency statin. \n\n# Chronic diastolic CHF: EF in ___ was preserved. Her cardiac \nenzymes were negative. Her home antihypertensives were held and \nbeta blocker halved in the setting of possible stroke. ___ \nstockings were placed for mild BLE edema. She had mild \nhyponatremia, likely from her heart failure. Despite having her \nblood pressure medications, her blood pressure was notably low \n(around 100 systolic). Her amlodipine was held at the time of \ndischarge. \n\n# History of Seizures: continued home Trileptal\n\n# GERD: continued PPI\n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\n- full code\n- consider restarting amlodipine outpatient \n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

There is no hemorrhage, edema, shift of midline \nstructures, or\nevidence of acute infarction.  The basal cisterns are patent and \ngray-white\nmatter differentiation is preserved.  Post-surgical changes from \nprior right frontoparietal craniotomy are noted.  The visualized \nparanasal sinuses, mastoid air cells, and middle ear cavities \nare clear.\n \nIMPRESSION:\n1.  No acute hemorrhage or mass effect.\n2.  Large area of encephalomalacia in the right frontal lobe at \nthe site of\nmultiple prior resections.\n___ MRI Head w\/ and w\/o contrast:\nThere is a large resection cavity in the right frontal lobe \nwithout\nany nodular enhancement.  The postoperative cavity appears to \nhave minimally increased in size.  There is a right frontal \ncranioplasty.  No fluid collection is noted superficial or deep \nto the cranioplasty.   There are no foci of restricted \ndiffusion.  There is a stable infiltrative signal\nabnormality along the margin of the operative cavity and \nextending into the\ncorpus callosum on the left frontal lobe which could represent \ncombination of post-treatment changes and infiltrative neoplasm. \n No evidence for acute\nischemia or hydrocephalus is seen.There is mild meningeal \nenhancement, which could be postoperative in nature, but this \nshould be correlated with CSF studies.  Ventricles are unchanged \nin size and configuration.\n \nIMPRESSION:  Postoperative changes in the right frontal lobe, \nbut no definite evidence for infection noted.  There is mild \nmeningeal enhancement, which could be postoperative in nature, \nbut this should be correlated with CSF studies. \n___ CXR Portable:  In comparison with study of ___, there \nare substantially lower lung volumes, which may account for much \nof the apparent increase in\ntransverse diameter of the heart.  No evidence of vascular \ncongestion.  There is some retrocardiac opacification medially.  \nIt is unclear how much of this could represent some volume loss \nor even consolidation in the lower lobe and how much could \nmerely be a manifestation of low lung volumes and the supine \nportable technique.  If clinically possible, lateral view would \nbe extremely helpful.\n \nThe right IJ catheter extends to about the level of the \ncavoatrial junction or possibly in the upper portion of the \nright atrium itself.\n___ CXR PA\/Lat:  In comparison with study of ___, the patient \nhas taken a much better inspiration.  Again there is an area of \nincreased opacification in the retrocardiac region with poor \ndefinition of the descending aorta.  Although this could merely \nreflect atelectasis, the possibility of supervening pneumonia \nwould have to be considered in the appropriate clinical setting.\n___ MRI C-spine (patient did not tolerate, stopped early): \nSeverely limited study due to motion artifact.  Although there \nare no findings to suggest epidural abscess, the study must be \nconsidered nondiagnostic.\n\n___: Non-Contrast Head CT\nStatus post right frontal craniectomy and drainage catheter \nplacement in a right frontal post-operative cystic collection \nwith interval decrease in size of a fluid collection. \n\n___: Non-Contrast Head CT\nIncreased size of right frontal postoperative cystic fluid \ncollection from the most recent prior head CT of ___ \nwithout significantly increased mass effect. Status post right \nfrontal craniectomy with unchanged position of drainage \ncatheter.  \n\n___ bilateral lower extremity doppler ultrasound\nIMPRESSION: \nNo evidence of deep vein thrombosis in the either leg. \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ year old female with history of recurrent glioblastoma \npresent with worsening headache, nausea, fevers and vomiting.\n\n#Bacterial Meningitis: Patient with worsening mental status \novernight of admission. Complaining of severe neck pain on \nmorning of ___ with difficulty moving without pain. Unable to \ncooperate for Kernig's and Brudzinski's signs. Spiking fevers to \nlow 100s. LP performed ___ showing very high protein (590) and \nvery low glucose (1). Gram stain showed 4+pmns and 1+ GPCs in \nclusters. ID was consulted for help with antibiotic coverage and \netiology of symptoms and meningitis. Patient was started on \nvancomycin and meropenem for broad coverage. Vancomycin was \nadjusted over several days for goal trough level of ___. \nPatient continued to spike fevers during adjustment period as \ninitial troughs were low. WBC count initially elevated but \nreturned to normal on antibiotics. MRI head with and without \ncontrast was performed ___ which did not show any evidence of \nintracranial abscess to explain ongoing fevers in spite of \nantibiotics. MRI of whole spine attempted ___ given ongoing \nfevers and concern for possible epidural abscess but patient did \ntolerate MRI which was non-diagnostic. Culture of CSF did not \ngrow any organisms in spite of fact that patient was not on \nantibiotics prior to LP. Her mental status waxed and waned with \nperiods of alertness and periods of extreme fatigue and \ndifficulty arousing patient. Narcotic pain meds were held as \nthese seemed to worsen her attention and alertness. Patient's \nfevers subsided on ___. \n\nPatient's parietal lobe incision from ___ was seen to be \nleaking on HD1 with fluctuance anterior to incision at level \nparietal bone. This was thought to be likely source of \nmeningitis given communication of CSF with outside world. She \nwas seen by neurosurgery who oversewed the wound where CSF \nleakage was occuring on ___. Her wound reopened with continued \nleakage on ___ and she was again seen by neurosurgery who \nrecommended she lay on her left side (opposite the incision). \nRevision of surgery was initially held given recent Avastin and \nactive meningitis. \n\nGiven concern for ongoing fevers initially while on broad \nspectrum antibiotics, evaluation of other etiologies were \nperformed. Patient was negative for C diff (had had diarrhea), \nhad no clear pneumonia on CXR, and no evidence of malaria on \nthick and thin smear (given recent trip to ___). \n.\n#Anemia: Patient with baseline anemia w\/ hct of 35. Acute hct \ndrop to 30 on admission but stable during hospital course. No \nevidence of bleeding at site of LP. No other source of bleeding. \nWould benefit from follow-up of Hct as outpatient to make sure \nit is not continuing to trend down. \n.\n# History of recurrent glioblastoma: - s\/p radiation, resection \nand chemotherapy, currently on bevicizumab. Last resection was \non ___. Follow-up MRI in ___ showed multifocal residual tumor \nat the resection margins, including possible subpial \ninvolvement, superiorly, and subependymal involvement, dorsally. \nPatient was continued on keppra for seizure prophylaxis. \nBevicizumab and TTF were held while inpatient. Neurosurgery was \nconsulted as above for leakage from previous incision site over \nright parietal lobe. \n.\n# Hyperlipidemia: Patient was continued on home simvastatin.\n\n# Code Status - FULL\nTransitional Issues:\n[ ] Antibiotic course\n[ ] When to restart Avastin and ___\n\nOn ___, patient was transferred to the ___ and taken to \nthe ___ for revision of incision and R craniectomy. There were no \ncomplications intraoperatively. A drain was placed in the R \nfrontal cyst and skin was closed. Patient was extubated and \ntransferred to the ICU for close monitoring. She is HOB>60 \ndegrees and drain is leveled at 10cmH2O. Head CT was done and \nshowed post-operative changes. The bone flap was sent to \nmicrobiology for culture. Gram staining was unable to be \nperformed secondary to the size of the specimen. \n\nOn ___, she remained neurologically stable. There was scant \ncyst drainage into the drain. ID was consulted and recommended \ncontinuing her antibiotics at the current regimen, Meropenum and \nVancomycin for 3-weeks. Sh was also fit for a helmet. \n\nOn ___ her vancomycin was increased to 1gram q8h per ID \nrecommendations and she was started on salt tabs. Her vancomycin \nwas subsequently changed back to 750mg q8hours later in the day. \nOn ___ her vancomycin trough was 8.3 and he dose was increased \nto 1.5mg q12hours. Her drain was clamped. Her incision remained \ndry and her exam remained stable. \nOn ___ PTT was elevated to 44, SQ heparin was decreased to BID \ndosing. Drain remained clamped.

She did not require behavioral or chemical \nintervention. \n\n#Psychiatric:\n-Psychosis NOS:\nUpon admission, patient stated that she felt \"in a fog\" and has \nbeen\nruminating about the voices that she hears. Patient believed the \ncause of\nthe voices has to do with a re-occurring memory involving a \nfamily gathering in ___ in which she observed other people \n\"getting scared\" and during which she \"passed out.\" She also \nstated that for the last couple months she had been unsure if \nher husband was her real husband or her son was her real son. \n___\nhearing voices of her relatives from ___ that made encouraging \nremarks such as \"be strong\" but also enforced her belief that \nher husband was an impostor.\nEndorsed noncompliance with Lexapro at home, but was compliant \nwith Abilify until she had a nosebleed and was concerned that it \nwas related to this medication. Refused to receive Abilify \nMaintena because she felt she did not need it and\ndid not trust her husband. She was amenable to hospitalization \nin so far as that she believed she \"needed answers\" and does not \nfeel safe to return home. In the context of the last few years \nof depression (low mood, crying spells, anergia, trouble \nfocusing\/concentrating, isolation, social anxieties, sleep \ntrouble), the pt has had intermittent bouts of psychotic \nfeatures.  For example, she often\nfeared that something bad will happen to her mother and brother; \nshe heard voices (they used to be persecutory but now are calm \nand supportive voices); ideas of reference (uses \"creativity\" to \ncope - she explains that she puts music and art together when \nshe gets stressed); she believed her eyeballs were changing \ncolors; pt\nwondered if her family were being kept away from her (i.e. she \nwas paranoid about not hearing from her mother as often as she \nused to). Endorsed SI prior to hospitalization in the setting of \nfeeling \"helpless\" and mistreated by the EMTs that brought her \nto the hospital. Denied SI or HI upon admission. Does not have \nconcerns about her safety on the unit. Continued patient's PO \nabilify in addition to administering Maintena injection on \n___. Pt reported no side effects or adverse events. She \ncontinued to endorse auditory hallucinations and demonstrated \nintermittent loosening of associations, but her reality testing \nslowly improved during admission. Patient hesitant to sign ___ \napplication for home services ___ prominent paranoia, but \nacquiesced as symptoms lessened. Both she and her husband agreed \nthat she would benefit from home based support with her \nmedications. Additionally reinforced with patient the importance \nof engaging in the community and social functions to prevent \nisolation in her psychosis. Arranged for follow-up with \npatient's psychiatrys and therapist, in addition to arranging \npartial hospital program after discharge. Submitted ___ \napplication on ___. Also spoke with husband about future \nconsideration of guardianship, in light of patient's recent \nhospitalizations.\n\n-Alcohol abuse vs dependence: Per collateral, patient had been \ndrinking one bottle of wine daily \"for the past few months\" \nprior to admission. She initially minimized her behavior, but as \nadmission progressed, she attributed most of her interpersonal \ndifficulties to her drinking. Believed that she \"just needed \ndetox\" and \"everything would be okay.\" Patient did not show any \nsigns\/symptoms of alcohol withdrawal during admission. Discussed \nwith patient, in presence of husband, the importance for her to \nstay sober upon discharge. Patient agreed and articulated \nunderstanding\n\n#Medical: There were no acute medical issues addressed during \nthis hospitalization.\n\n#Social\/Milieu: Patient was initially isolative in her room but \nbecame more visible as admission progressed. She attended few \noccupational therapy groups. Was not seen interacting with other \npatients.\n\n#Collateral:\nDr. ___ ___ has seen this patient for about ___. \nStates that Mrs. ___ has always presented as very calm, \nintelligent, and well put together during meetings. She is \"slow \nto open up to providers\" but over time, has revealed\nmany concerning psychotic signs\/sx to Dr. ___. Mrs. ___ has a \nhistory of the following psychotic signs: 1)Paranoia (during \nepisodes of decompensation, she accuses her husband of affairs \nand becomes very worried about his intentions), 2)Bizarre \nBehaviors (husband has reported that the pt will start howling \nand growling at home, while posturing - he has reportedly \nvideotaped some of these events, 3) Hallucinations (pt has long \nreported persecutory auditory hallucinations), 4) Negative sx \n(at times she won't take care of ADLs and displays some pmr). \nShe also commented on patient's increasing alcohol consumption \n(drinking appx 1 bottle of wine per night, although she \ncontinues to minimize this use). Much of the above tends to be \ntriggered by the holidays of ___ when the \npatient travels with her husband to visit much family.  This \ntends to amplify her sx and admissions have often been congruent \nwith this time of year. The patient's family have had to come to \n___ to assist her husband in caring for the patient.  \nReportedly, the mother and brother feel overwhelmed and have now \nchosen to disconnect from the pt because of her behaviors. Mrs. \n___ took Risperdal ___ in the past.  She did very well \nabout ___ year ago, when she did not travel for ___ \n___, supplemented regimen with po Risperdal, and did not \nrequire hospitalization . She was noncompliant, however, with \nRisperdal and chose to take Abilify.  She was also noncompliant \nwith this and had refused Maintena since stopping in ___.\n\nHusband characterized patient as always being somewhat \nrebellious and challenging of those in authority, and patient \nadmitted to transferring some of her struggles with her father \nonto her husband following his death. Articulated awkwardness \nrelationships currently as husband is in the position of \nmonitoring patient's medication compliance and how this serves \nas an imbalance in their relationship. Husband stated that often \ntimes when he is not available or is traveling, patient\nwill discontinue her medications. Patient has also been more \nsensitive to him being away and feeling insecure about what \nhusband may be doing when he is not at home. Asked for referral \nto ___ for home based services.\n\n#Risk Assessment:\nPatient carries several risk factors for self-harm including \nseveral recent hospitalizations for psychotic decompensation ___ \nmedication non-compliance, chronic and severe mental illness, \nalcohol abuse, social isolation, unemployment, marriage strain, \nworsening neurovegetative symptoms, lack of insight and \ntransient suicidal ideation. However, she carries several \nprotective factors including her established relationship with \nher psychiatrist, her supportive husband, lack of suicidal \ngestures in the past, desire to improve relationship with son \nand husband, and help seeking behavior, including willingness to \naccept Abilify Maintena injection and desire to connect with \npsychiatrist and therapist post-discharge.\n\n#Prognosis: \nPatient is at low or intermittent risk of self-harm insofar as \nshe remains medication compliant and engaged in outpatient \ntreatment, which includes regular socialization and activities \noutside of her home. However, if she devolves into her psychosis \nfurther due to non-compliance, she will likely require \nhospitalization. Discussed with patient's husband likelihood of \npursuing guardianship in the future.\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

An axial perfusion CT run was \nperformed during the infusion of 110 cc of Omnipaque intravenous \ncontrast. Subsequently, rapid axial imaging was performed from \nthe aortic arch to the brain during infusion of Optiray \nintravenous contrast material. Images were processed on a \nseparate workstation with display of mean transit time, relative \ncerebral blood volume and cerebral blood flow, MAP for the CT \nperfusion study in curved reformats, 3D volume-rendered images \nand maximum-intensity projection images for the CTA. \nFINDINGS: \nNON CONTRAST HEAD CT: There is no evidence of hemorrhage, mass \neffect, edema, infarction or shift of the normally midline \nstructures. Ventricles and sulci are normal in caliber and \nconfiguration. No fractures are identified. \nCT PERFUSION: The brain perfusion appears normal with no \nevidence of delayed transit time, reduced blood flow or blood \nvolume. \nHEAD AND NECK CTA: There is mild calcification and significant \ntortuosity of the great vessels. There is medialization of both \ninternal common carotid arteries. There is no significant \nstenosis of the internal carotid arteries, with the left \ninternal common carotid measuring 4.3 mm distally and 4.7 mm \nproximally and the right internal common carotid measuring 4.3 \nmm distally and 4.2 mm proximally. Tandem plaques are seen \nscattered throughout the internal common carotid. A hypoplastic \nleft posterior communicating artery is noted. There is a \ndominant left vertebral artery. There is no evidence of aneurysm \nformation.  \nMultilevel degenerative joint disease is seen, most prominent at \nC4, C5, C6. Calcification of the tracheal rings is noted.  \nCONCLUSION. \n1. No acute intracranial process. \n2. No significant perfusion abnormalities. \n3. Tortuosity of the great vessels along with medialization of \nboth internal common carotids, possibly congenital or due to \natherosclerosis. \n4. Multilevel degenerative disk disease. \n.\nMicrobiology:\nBlood Cultures are pending\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nThis is a ___ year old right handed woman with a history of of \nType II DM on low dose insulin, aortic stenosis, severe OA, ESRD \non HD (q TuThSa), chronic SC vein thrombosis (secondary to \nlines) on coumadin, multiple HD line infections, who developed \ndysarthria and left sided weakness during dialysis on ___.\n\nACTIVE ISSUES:\n# Altered Mental Status\/dysarthria and left sided weakness: The \npatient was taken to the Emergency department and a stroke code \nwas called. Her work up was not concerning for an acute \nintracranial process.  Her left sided weaknesses was resolved \nwhen seen on the floor, although she was still slurring her \nspeech and confused compared to her baseline. The differential \nincluded a toxic\/metabolic vs infectious vs hypoperfusion of the \nbrain.  Given that this happened while she was on HD, and that \nthis is reminiscent of her recent presentation and admission, it \nseems likely that hypoperfusion secondary to hypotension during \ndialysis is the likely cause of her altered mental status. She \nhas known Aortic stenosis, calcifications found throughout her \ncarotids on CT, and a known history of subclavian thrombosis. \nShe is no longer taking clonidine for HTN and was still on her \nlisinopril.  She takes lisinopril on HD days, and in the setting \nof her delicate blood pressures, this could have precipitated a \ntransient cerebral ischemia in the watershed areas.  \n\nInfection was also considered although she has not exhibited a \nfever or mounted a white count. Her LFTs are wnl. She also does \nnot exhibit any signs or symptoms of an infectious process. She \nhas a recent history of a yeast infection, however this is \nunlikely to cause global mental status changes unless she is \nfungemic. She could also have a toxic\/metabolic process, given \nthat she had asterixis on exam. However her electrolytes were at \nher baseline. \n\nNeurologically, though there was no evidence of an obvious \nstroke on Head CT\/A she also could have had a TIA given report \nof focal neurodeficit. She has vessel disease (CAD, DM2, and \ncarotid calcifications). An MRI would better characterize \nlesions, but she cannot get gadolidium due to her renal \nfunction. Per neuro recs: If patient has a return of more focal \nsymptoms that do not resolve with improvement in her blood \npressure, can consider MRI for infarct\/PRES, but no clear \nindication to do so now.\n.\nWe held her blood pressure medication (lisinopril) and other \nsedating medications (gapapentin and clonazepam). The morning on \n___, she was more lucid and at her baseline according to her \nprimary care physician and her systolic blood pressures were in \nthe 100s.\n.  \nINACTIVE ISSUES:\n# Subclavian thrombosis-her INR trended from 1.6-->1.9->2.4. We \ncontinued home dose of warfarin at 3mg qd, and did not start IV \nHeparin.\n.  \n# Right shoulder pain- likely due to degenerative disease and \nunderlying renal osteodystrophy and osteoarthritis given her \nobese body habitus. She was given tylenol for pain control and \nwe avoided NSAIDs given her history of H Pylori.\n.  \n# CAD - She had no chest pain, and her EKG was congruent with \nher baseline. We continued home Simvastatin 40mg daily, Aspirin \n81 mg daily and held her home Lisinopril given soft blood \npressures.\n.\n# ESRD: on HD for the past ___ years, we continued HD (TuThSa) and \nher home medications: Sevelamer 3200 mg tid, Calcitriol 0.5 mcg \ndaily, B complex-vitamin C- folic acid 1 mg daily\n.\n# GERD - asymptomatic on admission, but developed some acid \nreflux in the morning of ___. We continued her home Omeprazole \n20mg qd\n.  \n# DM II - last A1c 5.81 on ___, glucose today was 136. On 3 \nunits NPH qhs. She has a healing right heel ulcer.

We admitted you to observe your mental status. While you were at hemodialysis on the morning of ___, you were found to have slurred speech and your systolic blood pressure dropped. You were confused, had report of weakness on the left side of your body, and you were sent the ___ Emergency department. They thought that you might have had a stroke, but found that you didn't have evidence of this on a head CT, a strong Xray picture of your brain. You were sent to the medical team to watch monitor your mental status. Your electrolytes were normal for you and you did not seem to have an infection, thus we believe that this episode was caused by hypotension (low blood pressure) which delivered less blood to your brain and caused you to have your symptoms of confusion and slurred speech. Your left sided weakness had resolved by the time you came to the medicine floor. Your mental status improved with your blood pressure and by the time you left you were at your normal self. In recent times, it does not seem that you have hypertension (high blood pressure) and now it seems that you have hypotension(low blood pressure), so we recommend stopping your anti-hypertension medication (lisinopril) because that may be contributing to ___ hypotension(low blood pressure)."}

Unclear etiology but Mr. ___ was treated for \npossible pneumonia with meropenem and azithromycin. Due to lack \nof improvement and intermittent supplemental O2 requirements, \nMr. ___ underwent bronchoscopy to evaluate for more indolent \ninfection, but work-up thus far negative. Furthermore he was \nstarted on high-dose methylpred that was tapered to 60 mg daily \nprednisone for possible GVHD of the lung. Patient's cough is \ndramatically improved and he no longer required oxygen. Course \nwas complicated by patient's erythematous morbilliform rash that \nwas found to have biopsy results consistent with GVHD. The rash \nresolved with topical and oral steroids. Throughout \nhospitalization, Mr. ___ developed mildly elevated LFTs without \nsynthetic dysfunction. This was thought to be due to \ndrug-induced liver injury but given patient's known GVHD of skin \nalso considered GVHD of the liver as possible explanation.\n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES: \n================================= \nHEME-ONC: \n[] Mr. ___ is being discharged on prednisone 50 mg daily, \nplease continue to manage this medication and taper as seen fit. \n\n[] EBV viral load of 2579 on ___.

High suspicion for GVHD given skin GVHD per \nbiopsy results, but also considering underlying infectious PNA. \nInfectious workup negative for viral & atypical & fungal & BAL \nshowing no growth. Mr. ___ completed a course of ___ \nand due to concern that his symptoms were not improving, he was \nput on methylpred empirically for possible GVHD of lung. Saw \nrapid clinical improvements after addition of steroids. \nSubsequently tapered to discharge dose of prednisone 50mg PO \ndaily. \nTI: f\/up with Pulm ___ @ 2:30pm. will need CT chest week prior\nor AM of ___\n\n# GVHD - skin, ?liver, ?lungs\nMr. ___ presented with morbilliform rash of b\/l UE, thighs, \nchest, abdomen, and upper back w\/ bx results consistent with \nGVHD. Prior to these results finalizing, rheumatology okayed \ntaking patient off of sulfasalazine due to concern it was \ncontributing to drug rash. Concerned that Mr. ___ may have \nmultiple systems involved as he has also had recent rheum sx (hx \nof arthralgias, sicca sx), transaminitis, & lung opacities, per \nabove, which can all be manifestations of more chronic GVHD. \nFurthermore, recent wean off of tacrolimus on ___, could \nexplain emergence of GVHD.

Can see anaphylaxis to IVIG if IgA \ndeficient. Interestingly IgA low at 17 (normal 70-400), but per \nblood\/bank and pathology it would have to be undetectable per \nour standards in order to be true IgA deficiency.

The patient remains in a \nwheelchair or bedbound, with baseline incontinence of both urine \nand stool. The patient had never received any neuraxial imaging \nwhile in ___. Imaging upon admission was remarkable for a 4.3 \nx 1.1cm homogeneously enhancing extradural spinal canal mass \nextending from C7-T3, compressing the spinal cord at those \nlevels. The differential diagnosis for the mass included \nSchwannoma, meningioma, lymphoma, among others. Neurology, \nNeurosurgery, and orthopedic spine services were consulted for \nfurther evaluation and attempt to biopsy the lesion. \nHematology\/oncology provided recommendations for further \nevaluation and instructions regarding biopsy preparation for \npathology. The patient was transferred to the neurology service \nfor further evaluation. Attempt was made to coordinate a biopsy \nof her spinal canal mass with Neurosurgery and Spine surgery in \na combined surgery, but the patient preferred to wait and make a \ndecision as an outpatient for biopsy and further management. \nBaclofen was started prior to discharge for her spasticity.\n\n#Abdominal pain: \nThe patient presented with a history of chronic abdominal pain, \nwhich was worse when patient's lower extremity spasms worsened. \nA CT abdomen\/pelvis demonstrated simple fluid collection in the \nvagina; hCG was negative. OB\/GYN was consulted, and it was felt \nthat this fluid was not contributing to the patient's abdominal \npain, and that a speculum examination should be performed when \nthe patient's spasticity improves to the degree that examination \ncould be conducted. The patient's abdominal pain was attributed \nto cervical\/thoracic cord compression leading to spasticity of \nthe abdominal muscles. The patient's abdominal pain improved \nthroughout her hospital stay. \n\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

This corresponds to an area of hypodensity seen on \nthe CT scan, \nand this area is bright on the FLAIR images.  In addition, there \nis a small \nfocus of slow diffusion in the right posterior frontal lobe.  \nThis is also \nseen on FLAIR images, and also suggests subacute infarction.  \nThere is no \nevidence of hemorrhage.  There are no other findings to suggest \ninfarction.  \nThe FLAIR images demonstrate extensive periventricular white \nmatter \nhyperintensity suggesting chronic small vessel ischemia. \n  \nThe intracranial MRA demonstrates narrowing and irregularity of \nthe M1 segment \nof the right middle cerebral artery and narrowing and \nirregularity of the \nposterior cerebral arteries bilaterally.  There are also \nsuggestions of \nsimilar changes in the M2 branches of the middle cerebral \narteries \nbilaterally.  These findings are likely due to atherosclerotic \ndisease. \n  \nThe MRA of the neck demonstrates a normal appearance of the \nvertebral \narteries.  The origins of the great vessels appear normal, and \nthe common, \ninternal, and external carotid arteries appear normal.  There is \nno evidence \nof internal carotid artery stenosis by NASCET criteria. \n  \nCONCLUSION:  Bilateral supratentorial subacute infarction \nwithout evidence of \nhemorrhage. \n  \nIntracranial vascular narrowing suggesting atherosclerotic \ndisease. \n  \nCervical MRA demonstrates no significant abnormalities. \nRight Wrist x ray: There is generalized demineralization.  There \nare no signs for acute fractures \nor dislocations.  There are moderate-to-severe degenerative \nchanges of the \nfirst CMC and triscaphe joints.  No bony erosions are seen.  On \nthe lateral \nview, there is a dystrophic calcification in the posterior \naspect of the \nradiocarpal joint, which may represent sequela of prior old \ntrauma. \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nThis is a ___ yo. w\/recent CVA in ___ with residual moderate to \nsevere right arm weakness & pain as well as speech difficulties, \nrecently on ___ discharged to rehab from cardiology service \nafter PCI for NSTEMI, also with HTN, dyslipidemia, diastolic \nCHF, who presents with worsening of her right-sided weakness and \nworsening dysarthria and more confusion as well as severe pain \nin her right arm, mostly in her right\nwrist.  \n\n1. NEUROLOGY: worsening of right arm weakness and speech:\nRecrudescence of deficits from recent stroke and functional \ndecompensation, in the setting of recent cardiac events. No \nobvious infection was found. Possible etiologies of worsening \ninclude hypoperfusion from worsened cardiac function.\n-MRI\/ MRA of head and neck did not show any new finding. It \nconfirmed the previous ischemic stroke but no new lesion.\n-Worsening of right upper limb weakness : in addition to \nrecrudescence it could be worsened by right wrist severe pain \nand increased development of a spastic tone in her right distal \narm\/hand.\n\n2. CARDIOVASCULAR:\nChest pain with high troponin: her chest pain resolved and her \ntroponin was stable and eventually trending down, Cardiology \nteam thinks that the reason of high troponin is recent MI. ECG \ndid not show any new changes. \n\n3. ID:\nUrine analysis showed bacteria and WBC, but urine culture came \nback negative .\nCXR did not show any infiltration.\nShe never had fever.\n\n4. MSK: right wrist joint pain without redness, swelling or \nwarmness: Xray was performed : did not show any fracture or \ndislocation but showed DJD.\nWe check rheumatoid factor which was 12 (normal), we also check \nuric acid which was slightly high. Pain was controlled with \ntramadol and gabapentin.\n\n5. She was evaluated by Physycal therapy service will go to \nrehab for improvement.\n \nMedications on Admission:\n1.

We tried to treat you pain with medicines but it continued. We did a CT of your spine to rule out bony abnormalities, and it was negative. Ultrasound of your kidneys were negative, too, so we didn't think you had a kidney infection. We were unable to determine the cause of your back pain. We really think you should get an MRI for further workup, and we can't give you one here because our neurosurgeons cannot readjust your shunt after the imaging. You also had some low blood pressure during your stay. We think it may have been from some of the pain medicines we were giving you. We took you to the ICU for closer mointoring. They were able to get a PICC line in and give you fluids to help your blood pressure. You also spiked fevers during your hospital stay. We don't know what is causing this, so that is another reason we think you should have an MRI, to rule out any possible infections in your back. We will transfer you to ___ hospital where your shunt was placed and they will be able to do an MRI there."}

There are lower lung volumes, which may \naccount for some increased prominence of the transverse diameter \nof the heart. Engorgement of the pulmonary vessels continues \nconsistent with elevation of pulmonary venous pressure.\n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nThis is a ___ year old man with CAD, CHF w\/ AICD, PVD with stent, \npresenting with recurrent MSSA bacteremia, failing 6 week iv \ncephazolin and L atrial appendage mass concerning for bacterial \nendocarditis.  \n.  \nACTIVE ISSUES\n# Bacteremia - Pt was first found to have MSSA bacteremia in \nearly ___ at OSH.  In late ___ his bacteremia persisted and was \nfound to have a left atrial appendage mass on TEE, concerning \nfor vegetation.  He was treated with iv cefazolin via a PICC \nline for 6 weeks.  However, he again became febrile with MSSA \nbacteremia shortly after finishing the 6-week course of \nantibiotics.  Pt was transferred to ___ at this point.  We \nreviewed outpatient studies (TEE in ___ and in ___ and \nperformed our own TTE and TEE.  Pt was found to have aortic \nregurgitation and mitral vegetation, concerning for classical \nbacterial endocarditis.  We were not convinced that the left \natrial appendage had abnormal mass.  The persistent bacterial \ngrowth is likely secondary to the presence of foreign device, \nie. the AICD.  We removed the pacing device and wire on HD#3.  \nPt was started on nafcillin since admission.  His blood culture \nremained negative during this hospitalization.  He also \nunderwent a CT abd\/pelvis, with no evidence of abscess.  His CXR \nand urine studies were negative for infection.  Pt underwent a \nPICC placement over his left arm.  We intentially left the right \nside intact given the possibility of future pacemaker placement.\n.  \n# ___: Pt was found to have worsening kidney function on HD#2 \nwith Cr increased from 0.9 to 1.5.  His ___ is felt likely \nsecondary to prerenal as poor po intake or ATN in the setting of \nbacteremia.  There is no clinical evidence of nafcillin or urine \neosinophilia.  His kidney function remained stable at the new \nCr.   \n.\n# Ischemic cardiomyopathy: Pt has know ischemic cardiomyopathy.  \nOn the ECHO, he was found to have EF of 35-40%.  There is no \nprevious history of arrhythmia.  His AICD was placed for mainly \nsecondary prevention.  To the best of our knowledge, pt has not \nhad coronary stents recently and his plavix was started for \niliac artery stents placed in ___.  We held his carvedilol and \nlosartan in the setting of sepsis.  Upon discharge, we restarted \nhis losartan at 25 mg qd, and changed carvedilol to metoprolol \n12.5 mg bid.  Upon the discontinuation of the BiV pacing device, \nthere was a decrease in blood pressure, suggesting the benefit \nof BiV pacing for his current cardiac function.  Per EP team, pt \nwill benefit from replacement of the BiV pacemaker after the \ncomplete resolution of her bacteremia.  His Lasix was briefly \nheld this admission in the setting of elevated Cr, he will be \nrestarted on Lasix 20mg PO at the time of discharge.  \n.\n# Concerns for skin cancer: pt has a 2 cm plaque with scab over \nhis head.  The appearance of the the lesion is concerning for \nsquamous cell carcinoma of the skin.  Pt will need dermatology \nfollow up for further evaluation.\n.\n# Incidental lung nodules: Pt was found to have a 7 mm right \nmiddle lobe pulmonary nodule.  He will benefit from a dedicated \nchest CT for further evaluation.\n.\nCHRONIC ISSUES\n# Anemia: Macrocytic anemia, likely ___ alcohol, B12\/folate \ndeficiency.  His HCT remained stable during this admission.\n.\n# Thrombocytpenia: Baseline 90-100s, Platelet was in the ___ \nupon admission, likely ___ a component of sepsis in the setting \nof cirrhosis and chronic alcohol abuse.  His thrombocytopenia \nimproved to his baseline at the time of discharge. \n.\n# Cirrhosis: Per report is alcohol related.  He currently is not \ndrinking.  Current data suggest synthetic dysfunction, \nthrombocytopenia, and bilirubinemia.  Evidence of spider angioma \non physical exam.  Per report, there is history of ascites, but \nno varices.  Pt will benefit from liver followup as outpatient.\n.\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES\n# CODE STATUS: full (confirmed with pt)\n# PENDING STUDIES AT DISCHARGE\n  - Blood culture ___ X2, ___ X3, ___ - no growth \nto date\n  - PICC TIP culture ___ - no growth to date\n  - Device culture ___ - no growth to date\n# MEDICATION CHANGES\n  - STOPPED Coreg\n  - STOPPED KCL\n  - STARTED metoprolol 12.5 mg bid\n  - STARTED nafcillin 2 g q4h (1st dose ___\n# FOLLOWUP PLAN\n  - Pt has a single lumen PICC over his left arm.

His EKG at the time of admit demonstrated \nAV-dissociation with a ventricular rate of 40, and this has been \nat least intermittently occurring since ___. Cardiology \nmentions that based on the morphology of the ventricular escape \nrhythm, it appears to be in the nodal region and appears to be \nstable. The source of the nodal dysfunction is likely due to his \nprior ischemic cardiomyopathy or structural heart disease or \nfibrosis of the conduction system. Enhanced vagal tone is \nanother consideration, as are medications that interfere with \nnodal conduction, however, he presents on no AV-nodal blockers. \nHe appears hemodynamically stable on admission. His troponins \nincreased from baseline transiently and were trending down at \nthe time of discharge. Cardiology was unconcerendd and he is \nthought to be at baseline. Cardiology was consulted during this \nadmission  and they have no plans for any pacemaker placement \ngiven his overall state of health, and current infection and \nrisk of infection of the pace maker. Thyroid function tests were \nobtained and were normal. He remained hemodynamically stable \nthroughout his MICU stay and tolerated bradycardia into the low \n___.  \n-avoid QT prolongation medications\n-optimize electrolytes\n\n# URINARY TRACT INFECTION - Asymptomatic and already on \nCeftriaxone for his epidural abscess treatment.\n\n# PROLONGED QTC - Patient presents with evidence of QTc of 560 \nmsec. Previously has been in the 450-500 msec range per recent \nEKGs. His Seroquel was discontinued given QTc concerns. In \ndiscussions with the patient it was decided to discontinue his \nfluoxetine as well as he felt that this wasn't necessary at this \ntime given its potential for Qtc prolongation. It is critical \nthat his Qtc be controlled in the setting of his complete heart \nblock to prevent Torsades.\n-aboid QT prolonging medications\n-Stopped seroquel\n-stopped fluoxetine\n.\n# EPIDURAL ABSCESS AND T9 OSTEOMYELITIS - Came in from rehab on \nantibiotics.  Has been maintained on Ceftriaxone 2 gram IV every \n24 hours which is to continue through ___ for confirmed \nStrep viridans in the T9 vertebrae. Her has been continued on \ncalcium and vitamin D for bone metabolism. \n-finish course of ceftriaxone on ___\n\n# CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE (CAD) - Known history of CAD and is \nstatus post bypass in ___.

On admission he had an EKG with inferior \nand anterior Q waves present, nonspecific T-wave inversions in \nV4-6. patient had a Troponin of 0.14 (which has been in a \nsimilar range given his renal insufficiency). Cardiology was \naware and had no acute concerns for active coronary ischemia at \nthis point. While in the MICU he was continued asprinm, \nClopidogrel, and hisstatin medications. He was maintained on \ntelemetry\n\n# DECUBITUS, SACRAL ULCER - this was present on admission\n-on ceftriaxone for his epidural abscess\n-wound care was following\n\n# CHRONIC RENAL INSUFFICIENCY - Evidence of possible chronic \nkidney disease.  Will con't Furosemide 40 mg PO QHS with good \nurine output.  His Cr stayed stable and nephrotoxins were \navoided and medications were renally dosed.  \n\n# CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE - On admission exam and chest xray do \nnot demonstrate significant volume overload. He will likely \nbenfit from an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor given \nrenal insufficiency. Continued furosemide 40 mg PO each day. \nAV-nodal blockers were avoided given AV-dissociation concerns. \nWhile in the MICU daily weights, strict ins and outs were \nobtained.\n\n# CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE - Evidence of COPD and \nstable on inhalers and nebulizers with home oxygen requirement. \nNo evidence of acute exacerbation, stable oxygen requirement and \nno wheezing on exam. While in the MICU we maintained oxygen \nsupplementation, as needed. Albuterol and ipratropium nebulizers \nwere given as needed, and we continued his fluticasone and \ntiotropium as well as incentive spirometry.\n\n# OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP APNEA - Patient has required continuous \npositive airway pressure (CPAP) at home and this has been \ncontinued on recent admissions with oxygen saturations in the \nhigh ___.

There was no intervention \nperformed at that time. On admission to the ___, she reported \nlong-term bladder incontinence, several weeks of bowel \nincontinence, and low back pain. She had pain with standing that \nprevented ambulation, but she had no lower extremity weakness or \n___ numbness and her rectal tone was assessed by Neuro \nin the ED and found to be \"moderate.\" Neurologic exam on the \nfloor showed preserved ___ strength in all muscle groups in the \nlower extremities. Based on this, suspicion for cauda equina \nsyndrome was low. Neurosurgery was consulted and recommended \nevaluation with bone scan & MRI to assess for abscess or \nosteomyelitis. This was obtained on ___ and was read as a \nnonrecent compression fracture of the L4 vertebral body with \nmoderate stenosis of the spinal canal and severe stenosis of the \nneural foramen at L4-5. Bone scan showed increased uptake at L4 \nw\/ no evidence of metastatic bone disease elsewhere. Based on \nthese results, neurosurgery stated that they did not think the \npatient had an abscess or osteomyelitis and recommended \nconservative management.  They offered that a CT guided bone bx \ncould be obtained if concern remained high. This was considered, \nbut after discussion with Radiology & Nuclear Medicine, who felt \nthat her imaging did not support a diagnosis of either, the \nprimary team decided to discharge pt. with a plan for follow-up \nregarding a bone biopsy per Neurosurgery's recommendations. Of \nnote, patient remained afebrile with a normal white blood cell \ncount throughout her stay. None of her blood cultures showed \ngrowth at time of discharge, though she did have an elevated ESR \nto 110 and a CRP to 59.7.

She remained \nasymptomatic throughout and given IV & PO Metoprolol to improve \nher heart rate. She returned to normal sinus rhythm between \nepisodes and was discharged in a normal sinus rhythm. Cardiology \nwas consulted and recommended starting Metoprolol, Amiodarone, \nCoumadin and ___ of Hearts monitor, all of which have been \ninitiated. Amiodarone was started on ___ at a dose of 400mg \nBID which she should cont till ___. Dose should then \ndecrease 400mg daily ___ through ___. Dose should then \ndecrease to 200mg daily (no dose changes after this. Coumadin \nwas started on the day of discharge, so it will need to be \nmonitored daily and adjusted as needed until she is therapeutic \n(INR 2.0-3.0) and then weekly thereafter (note that amiodarone \nincreases blood levels of warfarin).

While you were here you had several imaging tests that indicated that you had a compression fracture in one of your lumbar vertebrae. You were given pain medication for the low back pain and will return to a rehabilitation facility to help you with walking. In the hospital, you also had two episodes of an irregular heart rhythm. A team of cardiologists assessed this rhythm and recommended a new medication called, Amiodarone, to treat it. You were placed on this medication and your heart has remained in a normal rhythm."}

There is normal regional \nand global left ventricular systolic function. Quantitative \nbiplane left ventricular ejection fraction is 56 % (normal \n54-73%). Left ventricular cardiac index is normal (>2.5 \nL\/min\/m2). There is no resting left ventricular outflow tract \ngradient. Mildly dilated right ventricular cavity with normal \nfree wall motion. Tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion \n(TAPSE) is normal. Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function \nis likely lower due to the severity of tricuspid regurgitation. \nThe aortic sinus diameter is normal for gender with a normal \nascending aorta diameter for gender. The aortic arch diameter is \nnormal. There is no evidence for an aortic arch coarctation. The \naortic valve leaflets (3) are moderately thickened. There is \nmoderate aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.0-1.5 cm2). There \nis trace aortic regurgitation. There is a bileaflet mechanical \nmitral valve prosthesis. The prosthesis is well-seated, with \nnormal disc motion and high normal mean gradient. There is mild \n[1+] mitral regurgitation.

Again there is prominent globular enlargement \nof the cardiac silhouette with only mild vascular congestion in \nthis patient with mitral valve replacement. The opacification at \nthe right base with obscuration of the hemidiaphragm appears \nmore prominent, suggesting some re-accumulation of hemothorax.  \nOtherwise, little change. \n\nCXR PA and Lat ___\nIn comparison with the study of ___.  There is little \ninterval change. The right chest tube remains in place with no \nsignificant pleural effusion or evidence of pneumothorax.

S\/p\nR-sided chest tube placement by thoracic surgery that was \nremoved\n___. Repeat imaging with stable RP hematoma and improvement in\nnow small, R-sided pleural effusion, which appeared simple on\nmultiple ultrasounds by IP. In discussion with cardiology, home\nASA 81mg was discontinued in setting of spontaneous bleed. Home\nINR goal was narrowed from 2.5-3.5 to 2.5-3.0 for mechanical\nmitral valve. Anticoagulation was resumed without e\/o recurrent\nbleeding, and she will be discharged on lovenox bridge to\ncoumadin for an INR of 2.0 on discharge. She will require daily\nINRs and lovenox bridging until INR is >2.5 x 48h.\nAnticoagulation management to be assumed by PCP after rehab\ndischarge. Hgb 8.7 on discharge. Would repeat short-interval CXR\nto document resolution of pleural effusion.\n\n# Acute calculous cholecystitis s\/p percutaneous cholecystostomy\ntube:\n# Choledocholithasis: \nDeveloped new leukocytosis and RUQ pain this admission with\nhyperbilirubinemia, found to have acute cholecystitis on CT \ntorso\n___.

PTBD \nplacement\nwas not thought necessary. ID consulted for bile cx growing\n___, thought to be a contaminant and not treated. She was\ntreated with CTX\/flagyl for two separate courses given transient\nreturn of leukocytosis. CT abdomen ___ showed possible \ninterval\nbleeding into a fluid collection around the gallbladder, raising\nc\/f for a potential fistula between the gallbladder and\ntransverse colon or second part of the duodenum, ultimately\nthought unlikely given her rapid improvement and stability. She\nwill be discharged with perc chole in place with plan for ACS \nf\/u\non ___ with Dr. ___ to determine whether CCY will be\nperformed. If she is not deemed a surgical candidate, will need \na\ndrain study with ___ to determine whether perc chole can be\nremoved. In the interim, drain output should be monitored daily\nand ___ contacted if output <10cc\/d for two consecutive days.\n\n# Hypoxic respiratory failure:\n# Acute on chronic HFbEF (now recovered):\n# Moderate-severe pHTN:\n# Severe b\/l atelectasis:\n# R-sided pleural effusion:\n# Moderate AS:\n# Moderate-severe TR:\n# COPD:\nPatient with hx of COPD (not on home O2, although had been\nenrolled in pulmonary rehab and was being considered for O2 \nprior\nto admission) and chronic HFbEF (EF reportedly 40% shortly prior\nto admission). Initially presented to ___, where it appears \nshe\nwas diuresed and treated for COPD exacerbation, with course c\/b\nR-sided hemothorax as above. At ___, had persistent O2\nrequirement despite some improvement in R-sided effusion. CT\nchest w\/cont ___ showed only small pleural effusion and severe\nb\/l atelectasis without clear PNA, pulmonary edema, or PE\n(although not dedicated PE protocol). Repeat TTE showed mild\nsymmetric LVH with EF 56%, mod AS, well-seated MV prosthesis \nwith\nhigh-normal gradient, mod-severe TR, and mod-severe pHTN.\nCardiology was consulted and recommended diuresis. She was\ndiuresed with IV Lasix to well-below her reported dry weight of\n145-150lbs, and was thought to be euvolemic at 136.9 lbs at\ndischarge. Home Lasix 40mg daily was resumed to maintain\neuvolemia. Spironolactone was trialed, discontinued for softer\nBPs and deferred to outpatient cardiologist. There was no e\/o\nacute COPD exacerbation, and home Incruse Ellipta, Symbicort, \nand\nalbuterol were continued at the time of discharge. She continued\nto require ___ NC at rest and ___ with exertion at the time of\ndischarge. This O2 requirement was ultimately attributed to her\nunderlying COPD and atelectasis, with small residual R-sided\npleural effusion not thought explanatory, and she was discharged\nto rehab on O2. She has been scheduled for pulmonary f\/u on\n___ cardiology f\/u pending at discharge. Would likely benefit\nfrom pulmonary rehab after rehab discharge.\n\n# Mechanical mitral valve (goal INR 2.5-3):\n# Atrial fibrillation:\nHx mechanical mitral valve, for which she is on coumadin.

Cardiology consulted and recommended resumption\nof digoxin, which she had been on previously (although not since\n___, it appears). Rates improved with diltiazem and digoxin,\ncontinue on discharge. As above, her INR goal was narrowed to\n___ in setting of spontaneous RP hematoma and hemothorax. She\nwas treated with heparin gtt and coumadin this admission and \nwill\nbe discharged on lovenox bridge to coumadin for an INR of 2.0 on\ndischarge. She will require daily INRs and lovenox bridging \nuntil\nINR is >2.5 x 48h. Anticoagulation management to be assumed by\nPCP after rehab discharge. \n\n# Enterococcal cystitis:\nDeveloped dysuria without systemic symptoms on ___. Received \nCTX\nwith resolution of symptoms, but UCx ultimately grew VRE. Given\nher mechanical valve and risk for infection, she was treated \nwith\nfosfomycin x 1 prior to discharge, which should be adequate\ntherapy per ID curbside.\n\n# Hypertension:\nContinued home diltiazem.\n\n# HLD: \nContinued home atorvastatin. \n\n# Depression: \nContinued home venlafaxine.\n\n# Overactive Bladder: \nOutpatient fesoterodine was non-formulary so was switched to\ntolterodine while inpatient. \n\n# Microscopic hematuria:\nWill need repeat UA as outpatient to document resolution.\n\nCONTACT: ___ ___\nCODE: Full (confirmed) \n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES\n===================\n[] Discharge Weight: 62.1 kg (136.9 lb) \n[] Discharge Cr: 0.6\n\n[] Drain management:\n - Monitor drain output daily.

She had no fever or \nleukocytosis. Her abdominal exam showed only mild epigastric \ntenderness without peritoneal signs. Her ___ was negative. \nHer LFT's including amylase and Lipase were normal. Of note, she \nalso had normal CXR and KUB. No furhter diagnostic tests were \ndone. She was treated symptomatically and her diet was advanced \nwithout problems. She was discharged home and her diagnosis was \nviral gastroenteritis (our initial suspicion) or gastritits \n\/peptic ulcer disease. The latter was suspected because of lack \nof diarrhea and persistence of epigastic pain and nausea. She \nwas discharged on emperic PPI and Carafate. She was asked to see \na gastroenterologist in few weeks (appointment was scheduled) if \nher symptoms do not improve and do not take any NSAID such as \nIbuprofen, Indocin, Advil, etc. The appointment with \ngastroenterologist if for consideration of EGD if her symptoms \ndo not improve. She asked me to prescribe Chantix (Varenicline). \nHowever, I want her to discuss the benefits and risks of this \nmedication with her primary care psysician because of her \nhistory of depression. Neuropsychiatric symptoms (eg, mood \ndisturbances, psychosis, hostility) have occurred in patients \nwith and without pre-existing psychiatric disease. Patients with \npre-existing psychiatric illness (eg, bipolar disorder, major \nsevere depression, schizophrenia) were not studied in clinical \ntrials; safety and efficacy has not been established in these \npopulations.

She then called EMS and he received an\nadditional 2mg ativan IO en route. Upon arrival to ___ he \nwas\ncontinuing to have reportedly generalized tonic\/clonic movements\nand received an additional 2mg IV ativan. This seemed to help\nsomewhat, although he continued to have some rhythmic eye\nmovements so he was then given an additional 2mg IV ativan as\nwell as 1g Keppra. The abnormal movements stopped but he \nremained\naltered and there was concern he was obstructing his airway and\nretaining CO2. He was therefore intubated and  started on\npropofol for sedation. It was reportedly a difficult intubation\nrequiring multiple attempts, and he also had to be paralyzed \nwith\nrocuronium afterward due to persistent biting on the tube \ndespite\nsedation.

No acute intracranial abnormalities. \n2. Chronic infarcts with encephalomalacia in the right frontal, \nparietal, and occipital lobes. \n\n___ CXR\nCompared to prior radiograph from earlier the same date, a left \ninternal \njugular catheter has been placed, terminating in the mid \nsuperior vena cava, with no pneumothorax.  Exam is otherwise \nsimilar to the recent study except for improving linear \nbibasilar atelectasis. \n\n___ ECHO\nThe left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. \nThere is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal \ncavity size. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall \nmotion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. There is mild to \nmoderate global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 35-40 %). \nThe aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic \nvalve leaflets (?#) appear structurally normal with good leaflet \nexcursion. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic \nvalve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image \nquality. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic \nregurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly \nthickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. No masses or \nvegetations are seen on the mitral valve, but cannot be fully \nexcluded due to suboptimal image quality. No masses or \nvegetations are seen on the tricuspid valve, but cannot be fully \nexcluded due to suboptimal image quality. The pulmonary artery \nsystolic pressure could not be determined. No masses or \nvegetations are seen on the pulmonic valve, but cannot be fully \nexcluded due to suboptimal image quality. There is an anterior \nspace which most likely represents a prominent fat pad. \n\n Suboptimal image quality. No echocardiographic evidence of \npathologic flow. Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) \nof ___, left ventricular function appears less vigorous.  \n\n___ CTA ABDOMEN\/PELVIS\n1. No intraluminal IV contrast extravasation into the large or \nsmall bowel.  No abdominopelvic hematoma. \n2. Sigmoid and descending colonic diverticulosis. \n3. Heterogeneous micronodular consolidation at the right lung \nbase may \nrepresent sequela of aspiration or pneumonia. \n4. Intraluminal filling defect at the aortic bifurcation \nassociated with \ncalcified atherosclerotic plaque, extending into the origin of \nthe left common iliac artery, has the appearance of noncalcified \natheroma.  This results in moderate to severe narrowing of the \nluminal diameter of the infrarenal abdominal aorta as well as \nthe origin of the left common iliac artery. \n5. Intraluminal filling defect of the right profunda femoral \nartery extending into its branches, associated with calcified \nplaque, also likely representing arterial atheroma.  This \nresults in moderate to severe narrowing of the arterial lumen. \n\n___ LEFT FOOT X-RAY (POST-AMPUTATIONS)\nStatus post transmetatarsal amputation of all digits of the left \nfoot.  There are sharp surgical margins.  An overlying surgical \ndrain is noted.  There is soft tissue swelling and air. \n\n___ TEE\nDynamic interatrial septum. No atrial septal defect is seen by \n2D or color Doppler. Right ventricular chamber size and free \nwall motion are normal. The ascending, transverse and descending \nthoracic aorta are normal in diameter and free of \natherosclerotic plaque to 35 cm from the incisors. The aortic \nvalve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet \nexcursion. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic \nvalve. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve \nleaflets are mildly thickened. No mass or vegetation is seen on \nthe mitral valve. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is \nno pericardial effusion. \n\n IMPRESSION: No evidence of valvular vegetation, abscess or \nsignificant regurgitation. Normal biventricular systolic \nfunction.  \n\n___ EGD\nFindings: \nEsophagus: Normal esophagus. \nStomach:  Mucosa: Erythema of the mucosa was noted in the \nantrum. Cold forceps biopsies were performed for histology to \nevaluate for H.pylori.  \n Excavated Lesions A 4mm clean based ulcer was seen in the \npylorus.  \nDuodenum:  Excavated Lesions Multiple clean based ulcers ranging \nin size from 4 mm to 8 mm were found in the second part of the \nduodenum.  \nImpression: Ulcer in the pylorus\nUlcers in the duodenum\nErythema in the antrum (biopsy)\nOtherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ gentleman with past medical history significant for \npoorly controlled diabetes, CKD, CAD (NSTEMI with DES to LAD and \nLCx in ___, HLD, and ongoing osteomyelitis of his left foot \nwho presented to the ___ ED with altered mental status and \ndiabetic ketoacidosis, subsequently found to have acute blood \nloss anemia from GI bleed.\n\n========================\nACTIVE ISSUES:\n========================\n\n#) Acute blood loss anemia: The patient was initially admitted \nto the ___ ICU. He was then transferred to a ___ \ngeneral medicine floor in preparation for TMA for osteomyelitis \nas below. However on the morning of transfer, he was noted to \nhave a large maroon colored stool, estimated to be 500-1000cc in \nvolume associated with an 8-point drop in hematocrit and \nhypotension to the SBP ___. He was subsequently transferred to \nthe MICU. He was transfused 6 units pRBCs and 1 unit FFP. NG \nlavage was negative. He then began to have hematemesis; it was \nunclear whether this was due to upper GI bleed or trauma related \nto the NG lavage. The patient continued to pass clots per \nrectum, but he remained hemodynamically stable. He was evaluated \nby Gastroenterology, who recommended upper and lower endoscopy. \nThe patient underwent EGD which showed ulcers of the pylorus and \nduodenum.  Colonoscopy was attempted but bowel prep was poor.  \nHowever, GI felt that the most likely source of his bleed were \nthe ulcers seen on EGD.  He will require repeat EGD in 8 weeks \npost-discharge; GI clinic at ___ to coordinate.  H. pylori \nbiopsies pending. \n\n#) Diabetic ketoacidosis: Patient presented with serum glucose \nof >700, anion gap of 31, and venous blood gas with pH of 7.29. \nKetones present in the urine. Precipitant likely a GI source \ngiven vomiting in the days preceding admission and mild \nabdominal tenderness on initial exam. Urine and CXR without sign \nof infection, LFTs unremarkable, and initial troponin negative. \nDKA resolved with insulin and IVF, and patient was restarted on \nLantus w\/ ___. Precipitant likely infection.   Patient \ndischarged on Lantus 18u BID.\n\n#) Osteomyelitis: WBC of 18k on admission, with 90% neutrophils. \nBlood cultures grew back MSSA. Most likely related to \nosteomyelitis in foot. History of osteomyelitis of the left \nfoot, with initial ___ admission from ___. Patient \ntreated with nafcillin, and is scheduled to go to the OR for \namputation of his foot. Additionally, there was concern for \naspiration based on patient's symptoms and bibasilar opacities \non CXR; patient was evaluated by speech and swallow, and made \nNPO to prevent further aspiration events. TTE and TEE \ndemonstrated no valvular vegetations.\n\n#) Altered mental status: Resolved.  atient noted to be altered \non day of admission, and was AOx2 on arrival to the ___. CT \nhead in ED was negative for acute changes. Altered status is \nlikely due to toxic-metabolic derangement in the setting of DKA, \nvs changes related to infection. \n\n#) Acute on chronic kidney disease: Serum creatinine was 0.9-1.1 \nas recent as ___ but then 1.4 in ___ as outpatient. Cr \nelevated at 3.8 on presentation, likely due to hypovolemia in \nthe setting of DKA (with history of recent vomiting, Hbg\/Hct \nalso with hemoconcentration). Creatinine improved with fluid \nrescuscitation, suggesting prerenal etiology. \n\n#) Nutrition.  Patient noted to have significant dysphagia while \nin ICU.  Patient was evaluated by S&S multiple times and \nultimately liberalized to thin liquids\/ground solids diet at \ndiet.  \n\n#) Atrial fibrillation: seen on EKG. Likely precipitant is acute \ninfection. \n\n========================\nCHRONIC ISSUES:\n========================\n\n#) Asperger's and paranoid\/schizotypal personality: per prior \nadmission notes. Has at times limited his way of interacting \nwith hospital and rehab staff. Has required chemical restraints \nin the past. Intermittently refused medications and treatments \nwhile in hospital. \n\n#) HTN: was started on losartan during hospitalization in \n___.

However, trop negx1, no EKG \nchanges, and her chest wall and paravertebral cervical soft \ntissue were tender to palpation, which is most consistent with a \nnon-cardiac musculoskeletal etiology of her pain. The patient \nwas afebrile and had no leukocytosis, and had been on chronic \nantibiotics, making infection less likely.  Her chest CT imaging \nfrom an OSH showed sequela of septic emboli from prior \nendocarditis that were actually improved on more recent imaging. \nTTE showed improving tricuspid valve function with a diminished \nsize of the abnormality, reduced regurgitation, and density \nconsistent with healing tissue. The patient reported her last \nIVDU was prior to her prior hospitalization. Urine and blood \ntoxicology screens were negative. For pain control, the patient \nwas given ibuprofen, acetaminophen and hydromorphone; at \ndischarge these medications were continued, albeit at lower \ndoses.  She has PCP and ID ___.\n\n#Knee Pain: The pain is of unclear etiology, and began after her \nknee and ankle became acutely swollen >1month ago. At that time, \nshe reports her joint was tapped (no information from OMR or \npatient).  She denies trauma.  There is medial joint line \ntenderness with full range of motion, and exam was suggestive of \na medial meniscus tear or medial ligamentous injury.  An MRI was \nperformed on the left knee before discharge, and the patient \nwill require further evaluation as an outpatient.  Report \npending at the time of discharge.\n\n# Vaginal Discharge: The patient complained of thick, white \ndischarge and vaginal irritation consistent with vulvovaginal \ncandidiasis during the hospitalization. Endogenous flora could \nhave been compromised from prior antibiotic use. She denied \ndysuria, and a UA was negative for bacteria or inflammation. \nIrritation resolved after Fluconazole 200 mg was given once.\n\n# History of IV drug use: patient reports last use was prior to \nprevious hospitalization, and toxicology screens were negative.  \nShe was seen by social work, who provided her with a list of \nresources to help her remain sober.\n\n# Nausea: The patient was nauseous before admission and on \nhospital day 2. She was given prochlorperazine, which improved \nher symptoms. \n\n# Insomnia: Trazodone 200 mg PRN was given for the patient's \ninsomnia.\n\nINACTIVE ISSUES:\n================\n# Gastroesophageal Reflux: Per her home medication regimen, the \npatient was maintained on omeprazole 20 mg PO daily, and had no \ncomplaints of reflux during admission.\n\n# Anxiety\/Depression: The patient was continued on her home \nregimen of Effexor, Clonidine, gabapentin and Lamictal.\n\n# Tobacco Abuse: The patient was maintained on a nicotine patch.\n\n# Code: Full\n\n \nMedications on Admission:\n1. venlafaxine 75 mg Capsule, Ext Release 24 hr Sig: Two (2) \nCapsule, Ext Release 24 hr PO DAILY (Daily).  \n2. lamotrigine 100 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO HS  \n3. clonidine 0.1 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO TID  \n4. gabapentin 600 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO TID  \n5. trazodone 100 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO HS (at \nbedtime) as needed for insomnia.  \n6.

Chronic \nloss of height in the C3 through C6 vertebrae.  Moderate loss of \ndisc height, bridging anterior osteophytes, and mild \nuncovertebral\/facet joint hypertrophy throughout the cervical \nspine.  Broad-based disc osteophyte complexes are mild at C2-3, \nlarge at C3-4, and moderate at C4-5, C5-6, and C6-7.  These \nmarkedly efface the ventral thecal sac and obliterate the dorsal \nCSF space.  There is mild left neural foraminal narrowing at \nC4-5 on the left, and moderate narrowing at C5-6 on the left.  \nAnterior osteophytes impinge on the esophagus. Visualized \nposterior fossa demonstrates atrophy.  Mastoid air cells, middle \near cavities, and maxillary sinuses are clear.  Note is made of \nright palatine tonsillith.  Retained secretions in the \noropharynx.  Thyroid gland is heterogeneous.  Calcifications of \nthe bilateral carotid artery bifurcations. No pathologically \nenlarged cervical lymph nodes.  Moderate \ncentrilobular\/paraseptal emphysema and pleuroparenchymal \nscarring at the lung apices.  Chronic left pleural thickening \nand effusion, better evaluated on accompanying chest CT. \nIMPRESSION:  No fractures.  Severe degenerative disease with \nthecal sac compression at all levels, particularly C3-4 and \nC4-5.\n\nCT HEAD ___\nFINDINGS:  No intracranial hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or \nvascular\nterritorial infarct.  Ventricles and sulci are prominent, \ncompatible with\nage-related involutional changes.  Periventricular and \nsubcortical white\nmatter hypodensities reflect small vessel ischemic disease.  \nCalcifications in the cavernous carotid and basilar arteries.  \nNo shift of the normally midline structures. Non-displaced nasal \nbone fractures (___), with mild overlying soft tissue \nswelling.  There is also minimally displaced fracture of the \nright lamina papyracea (3:10), with overlying focus of gas.  6 \nmm right frontal subgaleal hematoma and mild left frontal scalp \nswelling.  Mastoid air cells and middle ear cavities are clear.\nIMPRESSION: 1. Small subgaleal hematoma.  No intracranial \nhemorrhage. 2.  Non-displaced left nasal and right lamina \npapyracea fractures. ATTENDING NOTE: The fractures described are \nof undetermined age. \n\nCT CHEST ___\nIMPRESSION:\n1. Lingular mass with post-obstructive pneumonitis, \nperibronchovascular and possible lymphangitic spread.\n2. Extensive left pleural and pericardial invasion, with chronic \neffusions.\n3. Innumerable nodal, liver, and osseous metastases.\n4. Right middle lobe inflammation or early infection.\n5. Innumerable osseous metastases, without pathologic fracture.\n\nR SHOULDER XR ___\nRIGHT SHOULDER, AP INTERNAL\/EXTERNAL ROTATION, Y, AND AXILLARY \nVIEWS:  There is an oblique linear lucency along the \nmid-to-distal medial humeral shaft, likely a nutrient foramen. \nMildly prominent deltoid tuberosity.  No\ndislocation. Mild glenohumeral joint space narrowing.  Mild \ncromioclavicular joint spurring.  Right elbow joint is grossly \nnormal.  The right lung apex is unremarkable. IMPRESSION: Mild \ndegenerative changes of the right shoulder.\n\nBILATERAL HIP XR ___\nThere is no evidence of fracture.  Moderate right and mild left \ndegenerative changes are seen with osteophytes, sclerosis of \njoint surfaces, and decrease in the joint space.  There are \nvascular calcifications.  There are surgical clips in the left \npelvis.\n\nMR HEAD ___\nFINDINGS:  The study is compared with the recent NECT dated \n___, and\n(motion-degraded) enhanced MR examination dated ___.  \nThere is\nsignificant image distortion of the diffusion-weighted sequence, \nparticularly at the vertex and a second acquisition is even \nfurther degraded, for unclear reasons (with no additional \nnotation by the MR technologist). Allowing for this artifactual \nlimitation, and comparing the two acquisitions, there is no \ndefinite focus of slow diffusion to suggest acute ischemia.  The \nprincipal intracranial vascular flow voids, including those of \nthe dural venous sinuses are preserved, and these structures \nenhance normally. Again demonstrated is both discrete and \nconfluent FLAIR-hyperintensity in bihemispheric, subcortical and \nperiventricular, as well as central pontine white matter, likely \nthe sequelae of chronic small vessel ischemic disease. There is \nonly mild bifrontal cortical atrophy, the midline structures are \nin the midline, and there is no intra- or extra-axial \nhemorrhage.  There is no pathologic parenchymal, leptomeningeal \nor dural focus of enhancement.  There is no space-occupying \nlesion, and the sella, parasellar region and remainder of the \nskull base, and orbits are unremarkable. The mastoid air cells \nand included paranasal sinuses are grossly clear. The regional \nbone marrow signal is overall preserved, with no suspicious \nosseous lesion.  Incidentally noted is severe degenerative \ndisease involving the limited included upper cervical spine with \nmarked ventral canal narrowing at the C2-3 and C3-4 levels, and \nfrank compression and angulation of the cervical spinal cord at \nthe latter, as on the recent NECT of ___ this has likely \nprogressive since the MR examination of ___.\nIMPRESSION:\n1. The diffusion-weighted sequence is very limited, particularly \nat the\ncranial vertex, likely due to technical factors (unclear, at \npresent);\nhowever, there is no definite large focus of slow diffusion to \nsuggest acute ischemia.\n2. No pathologic focus of enhancement or cerebral edema to \nsuggest\nintracranial metastatic disease.\n3. Bifrontal cortical atrophy and moderately severe sequelae of \nchronic small vessel ischemic disease.\n4. Severe degenerative disease in the limited included upper \ncervical spine, with significant compression and angulation of \nthe spinal cord at the C3-4 level.\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ year old male with metastatic NSCLC presenting s\/p \nunwitnessed fall at rehab. He was recently discharged on \n___ for an admission for nausea, vomiting and anion-gap \nmetabolic acidosis.\n\n#FALL\nMr. ___ fell off the side of his bed after reaching for the \nurinal. He recalls the entire event and denies any loss of \nconsciousness. He was advised by nursing to call for help if he \nneeded to use the urinal. He ignored this advice. The fall \nappears to be mechanical, however the patient reported right \nupper extremity weakness after the event. His weakness was \ndifficult to assess initially due to pain in his right shoulder, \ngrip strength was decreased to ___ on presentation. He sustained \na minor amount of head trauma. CT scan in the ED revealed a \nsmall subgaleal hematoma, no intracranial hemorrhage and \nnon-displaced left nasal and right lamina papyracea fractures. \nHis most significant complaint after the fall was right shoulder \npain. XR in the ED demonstrated no fracture or pathology of the \n___ joint. He received IV morphine with good effect. He used a \nsling during the early part of his hospitalization. Pain control \nwas provided with morphine ___ and morhpine IV PRN. After he \nwas unable to swallow, he was placed on morphine oral \nconcentrate 5q3h standing and ___ PRN.\n\n#RIGHT ARM WEAKNESS\nMr. ___ presented with right arm weakness which was initially \ndifficult to assess because of his right upper extremity pain \nafter the fall. On the second day of his hospitalization his \nstrength improved, however was clearly different from the left \nupper extremity. His right upper extremity strength remained at \n___ and he later developed right lower extremity strength. A \nfacial droop was noted by the pulmonary consult team, but was \nfelt to be facial asymmetry with preserved function of all \nfacial nerves and muscles by the medicine team. An MR head was \nobtain on ___ which showed no evidence of stroke and evere \ndegenerative disease in the upper cervical spine, with \nsignificant compression and angulation of the spinal cord at the \nC3-4 level. This was thought to be the culprit lesion. Full \nC-spine MR imaging was not obtained as the patient was \nsubsequent made CMO, therefore a compressive metastatic lesion \ncould not be totally excluded. The patient responded well to \ndexamethasone 10mg IV x1 followed by 4mg IV Q6hrs. His extremity \nstrength improved to ___. It remained unclear whether the fall \nand associated neck trauma precipitated further cord compression \nor if the weakness was present before the fall. Dexamethasone \nwas discontinued when the patient became unable to swallow.\n\n#FACIAL FRACTURES\nNon-displaced left nasal and right lamina papyracea fractures. \nCase discussed with ENT; non-operative, antibiotics recommended. \nPatient was started on a 7 day course of amoxicillin, which was \nlater discontinued with initiation of post-obstructive pneumonia \ntreatment.\n\n#SHORTNESS OF BREATH\nMr. ___ complained of shortness of breath since his discharge \non ___. He was admitted on 24hr nasal cannula oxygen. He \nhas a chronic cough which is unchanged. He denied sputum \nproduction, worsening chest pain, fevers and chills on \npresentation. His SOB is likely related to his primary lung \ncancer and large, malignant effusion on the left. The patient \nreceived a dose of levofloxacin in the ED, which was not \ncontinued on the floor. Chest CT noted focal RML ___ \nopacities suggestive of inflammation or early infection. He had \nno lower extremity swelling or other evidence of DVT. The \npatient developed low grade temperatures on his ___ and ___ \nhospital days; treatment for post-obstuctive HCAP was started \nwith cefepime and vancomycin. His fevers resolved, however his \nshortness of breath did not significantly change. His PlearX \ncatheter was drained as necessary. Output was quite poor \ncompared to his previous admission, <250mL per 2 days. The \npatient was made CMO and his IV was not replaced. Cefepime and \nvancomycin were changed to levofloxacin, but this was \ndiscontinued when the patient became unable to swallow. He was \non morphine oral concentrate as above for dyspnea as well.\n\n#METASTATIC NSCLC \nPatient presented with dyspnea, cough and community acquired \npneumonia in ___. Imaging studies included CT chest on \n___ which disclosed a consolidation of the lingula, \nbronchial narrowing, mediastinal lymphadenopathy, liver \nhypodense lesions and a large loculated left pleural effusion. A \nPET\/CT Scan from ___ disclosed the presence of an extensive \nFDG-avid consolidative process in the lingula, lymphangitic \ncarcinomatosis, non-FDG avid pleural effusion, FDG-avid \nlymphadenopathy involving the bilateral supraclavicular regions, \nmediastinum, subcarinal stations, hilar portacaval and \nretroperiotenal nodes. FDG-avid liver lesions and FDG-avid \nosseous metastases. Pleural fluid removed on ___ disclosed \na carcinoma. Immunohistochemical stains of the tumor cells were \npositive for CK5\/6, and CK7; and negative for CK20, p63, and \nTTF-1. This immunoprofile was nonspecific but compatible with a \nnon-small-cell lung cancer not otherwise specified. Extensive \ndiscussions between family, patient and primary oncologist lead \nto the decision for no further cancer directed therapies, \nincluding palliative chemo, radiation or surgery. \n\n#AG METABOLIC ACIDOSIS\nIssue on previous admission, attributed to lactic acidosis from \nmalignancy, and metformin. Metformin discontinued on previous \nadmission. Lactate on ___ 6.6. Anion gap stable, no \nimprovement with IVFs.  \n  \n#TYPE II DIABETES MELLITUS\nMetformin and glyburide discontinued during previous \nhospitalization due to reports of hypoglycemia and lactic \nacidosis. Insulin sliding scale continued during hospitalization \nin the setting of dexamethasone administration. Aspirin \ndiscontinued after CMO decision was made. \n  \n#HYPERTENSION\nBlood pressures well controlled this admission. Diltiazem 15 mg \nPO\/NG QID continued until CMO decision was made.\n\n#PROLAPSED HEMORRHOIDS\nStable issue. Outpatient follow up suggested during prior \nadmission. Patient ordered for an aggressive bowel regimen.\n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES\n*******************\n-PleurX catheter care, drainage PRN\n-Continue concentrated morphine solution for dyspnea and pain, \nmay increase to 5mg q5min as needed\n-Continue inhaler for shortness of breath\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

There is stable mild pulmonary edema. \nThere is concern for locuated left pleural effusion. Cardiac \nsilhouette is difficult to evaluate due to summation of shadows. \nEvaluation of lung apex is suboptimal. Cluster of calcified \nlymph nodes again appreciated at the right hilus, and axilla, \nand has midline sternotomy wires. There is likely hearing device \non the right. \n  \nIMPRESSION: \n1. Moderate right pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis, \nand chronic \nelevation of right hemidiaphragm. \n2. Concern for questionable left loculated pleural effusion. \nRepeat \nradiograph, non-rotated to evaluate further is recommended. \n3. Mild pulmonary edema. \n\nTTE ___: The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular \nwall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is \nconsiderable beat-to-beat variability of the left ventricular \nejection fraction due to an irregular rhythm\/premature beats. \nRight ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. \nThe diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels \nare normal. A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is present. \nThe aortic valve prosthesis appears well seated, with normal \nleaflet\/disc motion and transvalvular gradients. The mitral \nvalve leaflets are severely thickened\/deformed. There is severe \nmitral annular calcification. There is moderate valvular mitral \nstenosis (area 1.0-1.5cm2). Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation \nis seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral \nregurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The \ntricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] \ntricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is severe pulmonary \nartery systolic hypertension. The end-diastolic pulmonic \nregurgitation velocity is increased suggesting pulmonary artery \ndiastolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.\n\nCompared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, \nthe severity of mitral stenosis is similar. The severity of \nmitral and tricuspid regurgitation has increased. Pulmonary \nartery systolic hypertension has worsened \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nPatient is an ___ year old female with a pmh significant for CAD, \nsevere MS, afib, bioprosthetic AVR (___) and CVA who presented \nwith with SOB likely due to diastolic congestive heart failure.\n  \n#. Pump: Acute on Chronic Diastolic Congestive Heart Failure: \nTTE on ___ showed EF 55%-60%. During her prior admission even \nafter rate control for her afib RVR, patient was not able to \nautodiurese, and continued to be fluid overloaded. Lasix was \ntitrated to acheive a stable, oral dose that would be able to be \nmaintainned at home. On admission she had an increased JVP, \nfluid in her lungs noted on X-Ray and lower extremity edema \nsuggestive of decompensated heart failure although BNP was not \nelevated. Last ECHO showed moderate valvular mitral stenosis \n(area 1.0-1.5cm2) therefore will not aggressively diurese. Her \nblood pressures had been tenuous especially after lasix \nadministration. TTE on ___ revealed the severity of mitral and \ntricuspid regurgitation had increased and that pulmonary artery \nsystolic hypertension has worsened. She had a thorocentesis on \n___ which removed about 700cc of serosanguinous fluid. Based on \nlight's criteria the fluid was consistent with a transudative \neffusion. She reported feeling much better immediately after the \nprocedure and she required less oxygen. Her home regimen of \nlasix was changed to 80mg in the morning and 60 in the \nafternoon. She should have close follow up with focus on her \nblood pressure and electorlytes. \n\n#. Rhythm: Persistent Atrial Fibrillation: She was cconsistently \nin afib however she was rate controlled on 120mg diltiazem bid. \nHer coumadin was held and she was started on a heparin bridge \nfor her thorocentesis. Prior to discharge she started back on \nher coumadin and sent home with lovenox until her INR is checked \nas an outpatient. It should be noted that she is listed as \nhaving a heparin allergy however she tolerated heparin during \nher admission.\n\n#.CAD: She has a history of CAD s\/p PCI with successful LAD\/D1 \nbifurcation PTCA in ___.

There is a trivial\/physiologic pericardial \neffusion.\n\nIMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with \npreserved regional and global biventricular systolic function. \nMild posterior mitral valve prolapse with moderate mitral \nregurgitation. \n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ past medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, \nhypothyroidism, T2DM, with recent admission for palpitations who \np\/w weakness and found to be in tachyarrhythmia and concern for \nCHF on admission CXR.\n  \n# Paroxysmal weakness and AVNRT: Collateral information from \npt's daughter and husband suggests that her weakness is more \nparoxysmal and sudden in onset, not ongoing stable weakness as \nshe had described at admission. Given that she was in AVNRT at \nadmission during one of these episodes of weakness, this is the \nmost likely cause for her symptoms.  She had recently \nself-discontinued her metoprolol which was started for AVNRT \nduring a previous admission, it is not clear why she stopped \ntaking this medication.  We restarted her on metoprolol tartate \n25mg bid which will be changed to 50mg of metoprolol succinate \nat discharge.  She continued to have a few episodes of what \nappeared to be AVNRT on telemetry this admission which all \nself-resolved without intervention.  Her HCTZ-losartan was held \nthis admission and she remained normotensive.  TSH was mildly \nsuppressed and T4 was at the high end of normal, so her \nlevothyroxine was decreased from 112mcg to 100mcg.\n     Her admission CXR showed concern for pulmonary edema, \nalthough clinically there was no evidence of heart failure (no \ncrackles in lungs, no peirpheral edema, no JVD, satting high \n___ on room air).  She had a TTE which showed a preserved \nEF and 2+ MR.  ___ ruled out for MI, trop was slightly elevated \nafter her tachycardia in the ED but CK-MB was normal.  She will \nfollow-up with Dr. ___ discharge.\n \n# Subcarinal lymphadenopathy and granulomatous changes: \nPathology from recent biopsy of stage IV lymph node was \nconsistent w\/ granulomatous lymphadenitis. Sarcoidosis is in \ndifferential and most likely ___. This may be the etiology \nfor some of her underlying fatigue and nightsweats. This is also \nthe likely explaination for the interstitial changes seen on her \nadmission CXR given that there was no clinical evidence of \npulmonary edema.  Was supposed to see Dr. ___ week for \nPFTs.  Her appointment with pulmonology and outpatient PFTs were \nrescheduled.\n\n--Inactive issues--\n  \n# Anemia: Hct remained within baseline this admission, slight \ndecrease likley dilutional after she received fluids in the ED.  \nThere was no clinical evidence of bleeding. \n  \n# Hypothyroidism: As above, TSH slightly low but free T4 \nhigh-normal.  Levothyroxine decreased to 100mcg 6 days\/week.\n  \n# HTN: Was somewhat hypotensive in the ED while she was in \nAVNRT.  HCTZ-losartan was held this admission and will be held \nat discharge, BP remained well controlled.\n  \n# Hypercholesterolemia: Simvastatin 20 mg daily\n  \n# T2DM: Held glyburide 5 mg and covered with HISS.  Will restart \nglyburide at discharge.\n\n# Code status this admission: Full (discussed with patient)  \n\n# ___ issues:\n-Restarted on metoprolol succinate 50mg daily for control of her \nAVNRT\n-Holding HCTZ-losartan and BP remained well controlled, BP \ncontrol should be reassessed as an outpatient\n-Levothyroxine dose decreased to 100mcg 6 days per week, repeat \nTSH and free T4 in ___ weeks\n \nMedications on Admission:\nPreadmission medications listed are correct and complete.  \nInformation was obtained from PatientwebOMR.\n1.

Lung \nvolumes are low \nlimiting assessment.  There is mild left basal atelectasis which \nappears \nunchanged.  There is likely mild hilar congestion with mild \nstable \ncardiomegaly.  The aorta is calcified and somewhat unfolded.  No \nconvincing \nevidence for pneumonia, large effusion or pneumothorax.  \nVisualized osseous structures appear intact. \n  \n___ CT HEAD W\/O CONTRAST\n1. Right cerebral subdural hematoma containing acute and \nsubacute hemorrhagic \ncomponents, measures up to 8 mm an causes 4 mm of leftward shift \nof midline \nstructures.  Minimal change from prior. \n2. Expected evolution of the subacute infarct in the right \nfrontal cortex. \n\n___ CHEST (PORTABLE AP)\nIn the setting of chronic moderate cardiomegaly and persistent \npulmonary \nvascular congestion, new opacification at the lung bases should \nbe treated as possible edema.  Alternatively this could \nrepresent aspiration, particularly in the right lower lobe. \n  \nSmall left pleural effusion is new.  No pneumothorax. \n\n___ CT HEAD W\/O CONTRAST\n1. Evolution of the subdural fluid collection on the right, \nwithout evidence \nof new hemorrhage. \n2. Minimal right-to-left midline shift with effacement of the \nsulci and right \nlateral ventricle, unchanged from prior. \n3. Evolving infarct involving the right frontal lobe, better \nvisualized on the \nprior MRI. \n\n___  CTA HEAD W&W\/O C & RECONS\n1. The mixed density right subdural hematoma is stable in size.  \nThe small \nfocus of hyperdense blood within the anterior aspect of the \ncollection appears \nslightly denser than on the prior CT, but this is most likely \nartifactual \ngiven the lack of enlargement.  This may be reassessed on \nfollow-up \nnoncontrast CT. \n2. Stable appearance of evolving subacute infarction in the \nright frontal \nlobe. \n3. High-grade stenosis at origin of the left vertebral artery \n4. Mild short-segment stenosis of the proximal V4 segment of the \nleft \nvertebral artery. \n5. At least mild narrowing of the proximal left subclavian \nartery. \n6. No evidence for carotid stenosis. \n\n___ ECG\nSinus rhythm or ectopic atrial rhythm with one eposide of block \nwith a \nconsistent P-R complex before and after the block. Left axis \ndeviation. Left anterior fascicular block can also be considered \nbut the Q wave that is noticeable in leads I and aVL on this \ntracing is quite diminutive. Clinical correlation is suggested.  \n\n___ CHEST (PA & LAT)\nIn comparison to study of ___, there is an placement of a \nsingle lead pacer that extends to the apex of the right \nventricle.  Lower lung volumes with continued enlargement of the \ncardiac silhouette and persistent pulmonary vascular congestion. \n Opacification at the left base is consistent with volume loss \nin the lower lobe and pleural fluid. \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nMs. ___ is a ___ RH F w PMHx of prior left occipital \nsubdural hematoma in ___ and mild dementia who is readmitted to \n___ currently in Neurology Stroke Service after presenting \nwith a breakthrough seizure at her rehab facility. Ms. ___ \nwas recently admitted to the medicine service with neurology \nconsults following from ___ to ___, for new onset \ncomplex partial seizures which was thought to be secondary to an \nacute right subdural hematoma s\/p fall.  \n\nHer seizure was most likely secondary to a missed dose of \nlacosamide at the ___ center. We did not consider \nthis a failure of AEDs. While in the hospital, she was found to \nhave second degree heart block. We discontinued her lacosamide \nand phenytoin for concerns that these medications could be \ncontributing to her heart block. She was seen by cardiology, who \nintroduced the possibility of placing a pacemaker. That evening, \nthe patient experienced an episode of asystole and was \ntransferred to the cardiac ICU. SHe underwent placement of a \npacemaker with EP cardiology. She tolerated the procedure well. \n\nShe was restarted on lacosamide, as the concerns for heart block \nare resolved with the pacemaker in place. She will start on \nlacosamide 100mg BID, to be advanced to 150mg BID in 7 days. \n\nShe was also noted to have evidence of cerebral edema on CT \nhead, for which she was started on dexamethasone. She will be \ndischarged to rehab with a taper schedule: \nPlease take 2mg (2 tabs) every 6 hours for 2 days, \nthen 1mg (1 tab) every 6 hours for 2 days, \nthen 1 mg twice a day for 2 days,\nthen 1mg daily for 1 day (your final dose). \n\nShe will be discharged to rehab for further care and \nrecuperation. \n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\n* dexamethasone taper for cerebral edema\n* on lacosamide for seizures - will take 100mg BID x 7 days, \nthen 150mg BID ongoing\n* s\/p pacemaker placement by cardiology - will follow up with \ncardiology\n* follow up for CT head noncontrast and outpatient follow up \nwith neurology\n\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

The patient \nwas thereafter brought to\nthe catheterization laboratory and monitored anesthesia care was \ndelivered. Preprocedural antibiotic was administered \nintravenously. The nature of this procedure required \nmultidisciplinary planning and\nmanagement with the cardiac surgery, interventional cardiology \nand anesthesia physicians. All members of the heart team were \npresent for the following key components of the procedure \naccording CMS guidelines: Vascular access Catheter placement, \nDevice implantation, Vascular closure, Intraprocedural \nmedication ordering. Sterile technique was used throughout the \ncase. All vascular access was obtained using modified Seldinger \ntechnique and ultrasound guidance. An ___ sheath was placed in \nthe left\nfemoral vein and ___ sheaths were placed in the right and left \nfemoral artery. The ___ sheath in the right femoral artery was \nremoved and the arteriotomy was Preclosed, and the access site \nwas upsized to an ___\nsheath. A ___ Angled Pigtail catheter was advanced to the aortic \nroot via the left femoral artery sheath and aortic root \nangiography was performed. A temporary pacing wire was placed in \nthe right ventricle\nvia the left femoral vein sheath. Next, the ___ sheath in the \nright femoral artery was exchanged over an Amplatz Extrastiff \nfor the ___ sheath. A pigtail catheter was advanced to the \naortic root. Using a 0.035\"\nstraight wire, the aortic valve was crossed. Over the wire, the \nangled pigtail catheter was advanced across the valve. Baseline \nhemodynamics (left heart catheterization) were obtained and \nshowed severe\nAS. A preshaped curved wire was advanced into the LV and the \nAl-1 catheter was removed. Next, the ___ delivery system was \ndelivered to the descending aorta and the balloon positioned \nwithin the\nvalve. We then proceeded to advance the ___ valve to the \nascending aorta and to cross the aortic valve in a retrograde \nfashion. After confirming appropriate placement across the \naortic valve using\naortic root angiogaphy, the ___ valve was deployed with rapid \nventricular pacing at 180 bpm with great result by Echo and \nangio and a mean gradient of ~5 mmHg.At the end of procedure, \nright groin\nclosed with 2 proglide and an angioseal and left CFA closed with \nangioseal\nComplications: \nThere were no clinically significant complications.\n\n___ IntraOp TTE: \nCONCLUSION:\nThe left atrium is not well seen.

She was discharged on \ntriple therapy (ASA, Plavix, and Coumadin) for 1 mo, with plan \nthen transition to Plavix\/Coumadin (no ASA) for at least 3mo. \nPatient did not develop new chest pain or L axillary pain \n(anginal equivalent). EKG upon arrival did not show evidence of \nnew ischemia. She did show a mild troponin elevation, which \ndowntrended, likely due to CKD with possible demand ischemia due \nto severe anemia. Given her anemia, warfarin was held, and \npatient continued on ASA, Plavix. Once bleeding stabilized her \nCoumadin was restarted. Once she reached therapeutic INR on \nwarfarin her aspirin was discontinued to reduce her risk of \nbleed. She will continue on Plavix and Coumadin as outpatient. \nShe required higher doses of Coumadin than previous home doses \nto get INR back in range.

Although he was given ampicillin \nand has a history of penicillin allergy, it is very unlikely \nthis contributed to his shortness of breath given that he had \nnot had ampicillin for over a week prior to presentation.  He \nappeared significantly volume overloaded on admission with \nvascular engorgement on CXR consistent with CHF and JVP of \n11-12cm therefore diuresis was initiated with TID IV lasix. He \nhad excellent urine output, diuresing greater than 8L per day \nfor several days. A TTE was unable to be performed due to body \nhabitus, therefore EF is unknown, but patient likely has acute \non chronic diastolic heart failure. He was discharged on 80mg \noral lasix. Of note he had previously been on lasix and \nself-discontinued because of what he believed to be excessive \nurination. Patient was re-educated on symtpoms and management of \nheart failure and agreed to reinitiate this medication. His \ndyspnea had improved at the time of discharge and he was satting \nwell on room air. Patient will hopefully have continued diuresis \nwith net fluid losses over the next several weeks as an \noutpatient.\n.  \n# CAD: Patient ruled in for NSTEMI with positive cardiac enzymes \nin the setting of heart failure. Patient denied chest pain or \ndiscomfort. Although heparin was started in ED, he was insistent \nthat it be stopped. Patient not a candidate for cardiac \ncatheterization at this time due to morbid obesity therefore he \nwas medically managed with aspirin, plavix, beta blocker and \nstatin. His risk factors need to be aggressively modified \nincluding blood sugar control, blood pressure control, as well \nas increased physical activity and weight loss, if possible.\n.  \n# HTN:  Sub-optimal control throughout entire admission although \nslight improvement with uptitration of medications. He was \ncontinued labetalol which was increased to maximum dose of 800mg \nBID. He was continued on maximal doses of norvasc and HCTZ. \nLisinopril was increased to 60mg daily  \n.  \n# UTI:  Urinalysis consistent with infection, culture \nunfortunately not performed. He was started on bactrim (day 1 = \n___ and should complete a 14 day course    \n.  \n# ? Drug reaction: Patient likely had allergic reaction to \nampicillin however exposure was greater than 1 week prior to \nadmission and rash was resolving at time of admission. Patient \nwas given solumedrol in ED given history of penicillin allergy, \nbut not continued on steroids wduring admission.  \n.  \n# ARF: Unclear if CKD or ARF given baseline creatinine unknown. \nHe has multiple risk factors for chronic kidney disease \nincluding diabetes and hypertension. This remained stable \ndespite aggressive diuresis.\n.  \n# DM:  Poorly controlled at baseline and was not optimally \ncontrolled while inpatient. He was continued on 70\/30 insulin \nand the dose was uptitrated to 75 units ___ and 110 units in AM  \n.  \n# Dyslipidemia:  His LDL was in the ___'s therefore he was \nmaintained on low dose statin  \n.  \n# ___ edema:  Patient has significant lower extremity edema to \nthe sacrum likely from total body volume overload secondary to \nheart failure as well as chronic venous stasis. He also has \nseveral areas of shallow ulceration on anterior and medical \nsurfaces of lower legs. Wound care and podiatry were consulted \nfor recommendations regarding skin care. Clinical examination \ndid not appreciably improve with diuresis, however continued \ndiuresis will likely help. \n \nMedications on Admission:\nNovolog 70\/30 70 units QHS, 100 units QAM  \nRegular insulin sliding scale BID  \nNasonex 2 sprays daily  \nLactulose 30mg BID PRN  \nHCTZ 50mg daily  \nLactaid 2 tablet QAC PRN  \nPrevacid 30mg daily 30 minute before meal  \nLipitor 10mg HS with food  \nColace 100mg BID PRN  \nNorvasc 10mg daily  \nLisinopril 40mg daily  \nMVI daily  \nASA 81mg daily  \nLabetalol 400mg BID with food  \nVitamin B12 100mcg daily  \nTylenol ___ BID and PRN  \nAlbuterol Q4-6H prn  \nImodium 4mg daily prn  \nMilk of Magnesia 30ml prn  \n?

This morning, she awoke around 4am and says \"I\ncouldn't feel my hand.\" Also, she noticed \"my tongue was not\nnormal\" -- clarified to mean it felt \"big\" and \"wrong.\" She was\nslurring her words slightly. Her right hand seemed weak and less\ncoordinated. She did not alert anyone to these symptoms; she \nsays\nshe did not want to bother her children that early in the\nmorning. She did not eat breakfast, but denies feeling ill. She\ntook her normal dose of verapamil (120 ext rel), and found her \nBP\nafterwards to be elevated at 200\/100, so she took an additional\nverapamil 80mg as instructed by her physician; yesterday, she \ndid\nnot measure her BP, but says it is usually 140-160\/50-60.

Scattered periventricular and subcortical \nwhite matter \nhypodensities are also seen, non-specific, but commonly due to \nchronic small \nvessel disease.  The ventricles and sulci are symmetric and \nunremarkable, \nappropriate for patient's age.  There is no acute intra-axial or \nextra-axial \nhemorrhage, mass, midline shift, or territorial infarct.  \nBasilar cisterns are \npatent. \n  \nIncluded portion of the orbits is symmetric and unremarkable.  \nIncluded \nparanasal sinuses and mastoids are clear.  Skull and \nextracranial soft tissues \nare unremarkable. \n  \nIMPRESSION:  Focal hypodensity in the precentral gyrus on the \nleft in a \nlocation that could explain patient's upper extremity and facial \nsymptoms.  \nMRI may offer additional detail regarding acuity or other \nfindings to suggest \nacute stroke.  Scattered periventricular white matter \nhypodensities, \nnon-specific but often due to chronic small vessel disease.   \n\nMRI brain, MRA head & neck ___:\nFINDINGS:  There is slow diffusion along the left precentral \ngyrus in the \nmotor area compatible with acute or subacute ischemia.  There is \ncorresponding \nincreased T2 and increased FLAIR signal in this region.  There \nis no evidence \nof acute hemorrhage.  Small focus of susceptibility artifact in \nthe left \nparietal lobe may reflect area of prior hemorrhage or a small \ncavernoma or may \nreflect a calcification seen on the prior head CT.  A small \nfocus of \nsusceptibility artifact in the right frontal lobe may also \nreflect prior \nhemorrhage, cavernoma, or mineralization.  Additional similar \nfindings in the \npons have the same diagnostic possibilities.  Elsewhere, there \nare scattered \nfoci of increased FLAIR signal in the periventricular and deep \nwhite matter \nbilaterally, likely reflecting sequela of chronic small vessel \nischemia.  The \nventricles, sulci, and subarachnoid spaces are globally \nprominent, likely \nreflecting age-related volume loss. Chiari I malformation \nincidentally noted. \n  \nVisualized paranasal sinuses, mastoids, and orbits are \nunremarkable. \n  \nHEAD MRA FINDINGS:  The vertebral and basilar arteries and the \nposterior \ncirculation are normal without evidence of stenosis, dissection, \nor aneurysm.  \nThe posterior cerebral arteries are normal bilaterally.  The \nbilateral middle \ncerebral and anterior cerebral arteries are normal in course and \ncaliber \nwithout evidence of stenosis, dissection or of aneurysm.  There \nis no \nocclusion in the middle cerebral arteries bilaterally. \n  \nNECK MRA FINDINGS:  There is a normal three-vessel aortic arch.  \nThe origins \nof the great vessels are unremarkable.  Origins of the vertebral \narteries are \nnormal.  The bilateral vertebral arteries are normal in course \nand caliber \nwithout evidence of stenosis, dissection, or occlusion.  The \nbilateral carotid \narteries are normal in appearance without evidence of stenosis, \ndissection, or \nocclusion.  The images are slightly limited by motion artifact.  \nThe distal \nleft internal carotid artery measures 4 mm and the distal right \ninternal \ncarotid artery measures 3 mm. \n  \nIMPRESSION: \n1.  Slow diffusion in the left motor area along the central \nsulcus involving \nthe precentral gyrus.  This is compatible with acute\/subacute \nischemia and \ncorresponds to the area of concern identified on CT. \n  \n2. No stenosis or occlusion involving the head or neck \nvasculature. \n  \n3. Chiari I malformation incidentally noted. \n\nTTE ___:\nEchocardiographic Measurements  \nResults  Measurements  Normal Range  \nLeft Atrium - Long Axis Dimension:  *4.3 cm  <= 4.0 cm  \nLeft Ventricle - Septal Wall Thickness:  *1.5 cm  0.6 - 1.1 cm  \nLeft Ventricle - Inferolateral Thickness:  *1.6 cm  0.6 - 1.1 cm \n \nLeft Ventricle - Diastolic Dimension:  3.6 cm  <= 5.6 cm  \nLeft Ventricle - Ejection Fraction:  >= 75%  >= 55%  \nLeft Ventricle - Peak Resting LVOT gradient:  *140 mm Hg  <= 10 \nmm Hg  \nLeft Ventricle - Lateral Peak E':  *0.04 m\/s  > 0.08 m\/s  \nLeft Ventricle - Septal Peak E':  *0.04 m\/s  > 0.08 m\/s  \nLeft Ventricle - Ratio E\/E':  *28  < 15  \nAorta - Sinus Level:  3.0 cm  <= 3.6 cm  \nAorta - Ascending:  3.4 cm  <= 3.4 cm  \nMitral Valve - E Wave:  1.1 m\/sec     \nMitral Valve - A Wave:  1.4 m\/sec     \nMitral Valve - E\/A ratio:  0.79     \nMitral Valve - E Wave deceleration time:  *129 ms  140-250 ms  \nTR Gradient (+ RA = PASP):  *48 mm Hg  <= 25 mm Hg  \n \nFindings  \nThis study was compared to the prior study of ___.  \nLEFT ATRIUM: Mild ___.

A small, highly mobile mass \n(0.6 x .05 cm) is seen in the body of the left atrium and \nappears to be attached to the mitral annular calcification, c\/w \nfriable MAC vs. thrombus vs. tumor. This is best seen in the \nparasternal views but also seen in the apical views. There is \nmoderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left \nventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular \nwall motion is normal. Left ventricular systolic function is \nhyperdynamic (EF>75%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an \nincreased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). There \nis a severe resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. \nRight ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. \nThere are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the ascending aorta. The \naortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. The study is \ninadequate to exclude significant aortic valve stenosis. No \naortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are \nmildly thickened. There is systolic anterior motion of the \nmitral valve leaflets. Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen \n(within normal limits). Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. \nMild to moderate (___) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is \nmoderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a very \nsmall pericardial effusion.

Based on this history and your neurological exam, we obtained an MRI of your brain, which confirmed that you had a stroke. We obtained an echo (ultrasound) of your heart to look for a possible cause of a stroke. This showed a mass in your heart. This is likely a blood clot but it is possible that it is a tumor in your heart. Because of this, we started you on a blood thinner medication called warfarin (Coumadin). You will need to take this medication every day, and have blood levels checked on a number called INR. We have arranged follow-up in the ___ clinic for you. You will need to have another echo in one month to assess what has happened to the blood clot. Over the course of this hospitalization your weakness and other difficulties improved. We expect your deficits from your stroke to continue to improve over the next months. The echo of your heart also showed that you have a condition called HOCM (hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy). This means that there is an obstruction to the blood flow out of the heart. I believe your cardiologist was already aware of this. Because the outflow tract gradient was high, and because your blood pressure was high during this hospitalization, we made some changes to your blood pressure medications, and we will discharge you on metoprolol 100 mg every evening and amlodipine 5 mg daily. This plan was discussed with your cardiologist, Dr. ___."}

His last VPA level was 60 and his Carbamazepine \nlevel was only slightly increased at 7.6\n\nWith regards to his mania Psychiatry was consulted who \nrecommended trying to increase his Depakote dose such that his \nlevel was closer to 100, but Mr. ___ was very wary to \nincrease his Depakote too fast as he was worried about the side \neffects. As per psychiatry's recommendations, we continued to \nencourage him to take this medication but did not force him to \ndo so.

We think that in the past, Depakote had helped you both because it is an anti-seizure drug and also because it is a mood stabilizer and that your mood became less stable when the dose was lowered. In addition, we believe Keppra was most likely worsening your mood as that can happen frequently on this medication. We have done an EEG to make sure you are not having seizures and it did not show any. We stopped the Keppra and increased your Depakote. The psychiatry team would like to increase your Depakote more, so that your blood level is closer to 100, for better mood stabilization. They would also like you to take a medication called Seroquel to help you sleep. As we feel you need more inpatient therapy to help improve and stabilize your mental status, we have transferred you to the ___ psychiatry service for further inpatient psychiatric care."}

She complained also of a mildly productive cough with \nwhite sputum, had poor air movement and was treated for asthma \nexacerbation.   \n\n#. Asthma Exacerbation:\nPatient has history of frequent ___ visits and hospitalizations \nfor asthma exacerbation, particularly in the ___ and ___ \ntime. She reports no changes in home or work environment, no \nsmoke exposure, and no changes in detergents or soaps at home \nthat could cause allergen induced exacerbation. This \nexacerbation was likely triggered by a viral upper respiratory \ninfection, as she was having upper respiratory symptoms. She was \ntreated with azithromycin for possible pneumonia by the ___ the weekend prior to admission, but her chest Xray in the \n___ ___ showed no signs of pneumonia.  She was not started on \nany antibiotics during this hospitalization.  The patient was \ntreated with combivent nebulizers in the ___ then started on Q4 \nhours standing albuterol nebulizers on the floor overnight. She \nwas also started on 60mg of prednisone for 5 days, to be tapered \ndown as an outpatient. She was continued on her home medications \nof Advair and montelukast. A sputum culture could not be sent \ndue to poor quality of specimen. She was ruled out for flu with \nnegative DFA from nasopharyngeal swab and low suspicion. \n\nThe following description represents the course of her steroid \ntaper: \nPrednisone  10 mg Tablets as directed:   \n___ 6 tablets until ___ (total of 60mg) \n5 tablets on ___, \n4 tablets on ___, \n3 tablets on ___, \n2 tablets on ___, \n1 tablet on ___, then off.\n\nIn the ___, the patient's peak flow improved from 150 to 180 \nafter nebulizer treatment.  Her peak flow on discharge was 200, \nand she was ambulating with O2 saturation of 95% without \nshortness of breath.  \n\nShe was encouraged to follow her peak flow at home and seek \nmedical attention more quickly if it starts to drop.  She will \ncontinue home nebulizer treatments as needed but should return \nif she is requiring nebulizers more often than every four to six \nhours. She was set up with a visiting nurse to help monitor her \nimprovement and be compliant with treatments. \n\nBecause she is illiterate, the patient may need repeated asthma \neducation in the outpatient setting to help reinforce an Asthma \nAction plan specific to her needs. It may help to label her home \npeak flow meter with red, yellow, and green stickers to remind \nher when to start using her PRN medications and when to get \nhelp. \n\n.  \n#. Diabetes Mellitus Type 2: \nPatient's home regimen includes glyburide and metformin; she \nstates that her sugars typically run in the 170s at home. Her \nlast HbA1c in ___ was 6.9.  Her metformin was held \ninitially, so in the setting of prednisone therapy for the \nasthma exacerbation, her blood sugars were significantly \nelevated into the 300s on the first day of hospitalization. Upon \nrestarting the metformin, her blood sugars were still in the \n200s.  She was sent home on an insulin sliding scale to be used \nfor blood sugars >200 just during the brief course of prednisone \ntherapy with the help of the ___.  Ms. ___ was set up with a \nvisiting nurse to help with insulin teaching and administration \nand to ensure compliance with fingersticks.  The patient has had \nto self-administer insulin in the past during courses of steroid \ntherapy; she also regularly checks her blood sugars at home ___ \ntimes daily. \n\n.\n#.

The patient is confident that this is similar to \nprior episodes of pancreatitis. Her exam was  remarkable for \ngeneralized tenderness without signs of acute abdomen, and her \nexam remained stable throughout her stay. It slightly improved \nwith symptomatic management. Lipase was normal which was \nconsistent with her prior presentations, though unlike prior \npresentations, her other LFTs were also unremarkable save for an \nelevated alk phos. The patient did meet SIRS criteria based on \nheart rate and leukocytosis, though her white count appears to \nbe chronic and has been attributed to her splenectomy. She did \nnot have any fevers or chills. Cholangitis was ruled out with \nnormal LFTs; other etiologies of mid-epigastric pain have been \nconsidered including gastritis, ulcer disease, AAA, and \ninfection, though they were less likely at this time. Her \nhyperglycemia was likely exacerbating her symptoms as elevated \nsugars can worsen GI motility. She did have some diarrhea during \nthis stay, but she endorses alternating constipation and \ndiarrhea at home, and this was not significantly different than \nbaseline. She was able to tolerate a regular diet at the time of \ndischarge. She was continued on a low-fat, low-residual diet, \nwith her supplementary dietary enzymes (Zenpep). Her pain and \nher nausea were addressed, and she should continue on her home \npain regimen as well as her home anti-emetic regimen. \n\n#Hyperglycemia, diabetes mellitus type II, uncontrolled: Patient \nwith long history of diabetes mellitus that has been poorly \ncontrolled. Her last A1c was 11.5% in ___. The patient is \nseen at ___ by Dr. ___. She reports hyperglycemia beyond \nbaseline for the past several weeks. She was seen at ___ on \n___ at which time she was started on 25 units of U500 three \ntimes daily with sliding scale. However, with the syringe she \nhas been using, this dose is actually 125 units of U-500 TID. \nHer blood glucose in the ED was 545; she was continued on her \nhome regimen, and ___ on the floor were in the 160s. She was seen \nby ___ who suggested she simply continue on her \npre-admission regimen. She should continue on her home 125 units \nU-500 TID, in addition to her home Pioglitazone and Metformin. \nShe has close follow-up scheduled on ___ with ___, \nat which time her insulin can be further adjusted if necessary.\n\n#Hyponatremia: Sodium was 126 on presentation, but when \ncorrected for blood glucose was noted to be 133. Her chloride \nwas also low on initial presentation which was somewhat \nsuggestive of volume depletion; she recevied 3L IVF in the ED \nwhich did not continue on the floor. \n\n#Leukocytosis, chronic: The patient has had a chronic \nleukocytosis attributed to her history of splenectomy. Some \ncomponent of her leukocytosis may represent hemoconcentration as \nher HCT was borderline high. Patient remained afebrile \nthroughout her stay, and her abdominal exam continually \nimproved. She was tolerating a regular diet at the time of \ndischarge. Lipase was WNL. Bloodstream, pulmonary, or urinary \ntract infections were not acute concerns at this time. \n \n#Hypertension: Patient was continued on her home Clonidine and \nLosartan.\n\n#Chronic pain, complex regional pain syndrome: Patient has \nsignificant generalized pain at baseline.

Selective coronary angiography of this right \ndominant system revealed LAD, Ramus intermedius, SVG-OM \nocclusions. The site of the previous LMCA stent and the previous \nLCx stent was found to have no angiographically apparent flow \nlimiting stenoses. Please see interventional addendum for full \ndetails. In shoft, the ramus intermedius was found to be \noccluded and was crossed with some difficulty. Angioplasty was \nperformed with 2.0, 2.5, and 2.75 mm balloons and there was a \nresidual 20% stenosis\nwith normal flow.  2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed \nnormal systemic arterial pressure at 117\/60.\n\nFINAL DIAGNOSIS:    \n1. Occlusion of the previously stented Ramus branch (ISR vs \nthrombosis)\nof undetermined age.\n2. Successful POBA.\n3. If recurrent symptoms, stenting would be possible from the \nfemoral\napproach. Evidence of viability in this territory would be ideal \nprior\nto re-intervention.\n4.

Patient was sent back to the cath lab on ___ for \npersistent chest pain; no new culprit lesions were demonstrated, \nLIMA-LAD SVG remained patent.  The patient did well post-cath \nand was continued on Plavix (no stents placed).  Medical \noptimiziation was pursued, his Imdur was uptitrated from 60 to \n120 mg PO QD.  Because he is now on triple anticoagulant \ntherapy, his goal INR for his mechanical valve should be \n2.5-3.0.\n\nACTIVE ISSUES:\n \n# NSTEMI: Pt presented with intermittent substernal CP \nassociated with a troponin leak of 0.32 and EKG changes \nincluding t-wave inversions V2-V4 with 1mm ST depressions V3-V4 \nmeeting criteria for NSTEMI.  Pt's admission TIMI risk score of \n6 placed the pt. in the high-risk category estimating his risk \nof all-cause mortality, new or recurrent MI, or severe recurrent \nischemia requiring urgent revascularization in the next ___ days \nat 41%.  Pt. received 600mg plavix load in the ED and was placed \non a nitro drip.  Heparin and coumadin were held in preparation \nfor cath (INR 2.8).  Pt. had TTE which revealed LVEF 50% \nsecondary to hypokinesis of the posterior and lateral walls (new \ncompared to prior TTE on ___ int he region of the rams \nwith preserved function in the LAD territory) with a higher than \nexpected transaortic gradient higher than expected for his type \nof prosthesis (chronic and stable).  Pt. underwent cath on \n___ which revealed showed patent LMCA, LAD w\/ proximal \nocclusion, occluded SVG->LPL (seen previously), and LCX Ramus w\/ \nocclusion.  Pt. had LCx Ramus balloon angioplasty performed for \nin-stent re-stenosis vs. thrombosis.  Patient was sent back to \nthe cath lab on ___ for persistent chest pain; no new culprit \nlesions were demonstrated, LIMA-LAD SVG remained patent.  Pt. \nremained chest pain free 24 hours prior to discharge.  His \nmedical regimen was continued with an increase of his imdur to \n120mg Daily.    \n\n# Leukocytosis: WBC count 14 on admission with neutrophil \npredominance thought to be ___ stress response to NSTEMI.  His \nWBC count continued to increase in the setting of receiving \nmethylprednisone for pre-allergy treatment of anticipated \ncontrast for cath.  WBC was downtrending at time of discharge.  \nThroughout the hospital course, the pt. had no signs or symptoms \nof infection.\n \nCHRONIC ISSUES:\n\n# Afib\/Aflutter:  Stable.  Continued on coumadin for goal INR \n2.5-3.0, diltiazem, and amiodarone.\n \n# HTN:  Stable.  Pt's anti-hypertensives were initially held \ngiven titration of blood pressure with nitro drip.  His imdur \nwas increased at time of discharge while other home meds were \ncontinued at their previous doses. \n\n# T2DM:  Stable.  Placed on insulin sliding scale while in \nhospital.  Discharged on home dose of metformin.  \n\n# Asthma:  Stable.  Continued on regimen of memetasone inhaler \nand singulair.\n\n# GERD:  Stable.  Continued pantoprazole.\n\n# BPH:  Stable.

Pt. will be taking 5mg coumadin ___, 6mg on \n___, and will be rechecking his INR on ___.\n\n# Goal INR:  Pt. with AVR with hx. afib\/aflutter.  Given this \nhistory and given that pt. is on triple anticoagulation therapy \nhis optimal INR range should be between 2.5 to 3.0 (full \ntherapeutic range 2.5 to 3.5)\n\n# Beta Blocker:  Pt. had stated that he had not tolerated beta \nblockage in the past.  As such, one was not initiated on this \nadmission.\n\n# Leukocytosis:  Pt. had significant leukocytosis in the setting \nof NSTEMI and pre-treatment with methylprednisone for contrast \nallergy prior to cath.  Pt. WBC downtrending at discharge.  \nRepeat CBC should be done to ensure return of normal WBC ___ \ndays prior to discharge.\n\n# Atorvastatin:  Pt's atorva was increased from 40mg to 80mg on \ndischarge.\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

The \"small pill\" is either \nlisinopril 40mg or ASA 81mg. The overdose was because of \nincorrectly sorted pills (the patient is blind). A few hours \nlater the patient was noted to have difficulty speaking. Her BP \nwas checked and found to be 80\/40. HR also decreased.

Home medication overdose, which led to bradycardia, relative \nhypotension, and dysarthria.  As mentioned in HPI, patient \nreceived 0.5 mg atropine and calcium carbonate and responded \nwith transient improvement of her bradycardia.  Her home \nmedication Cartia XT and lisinopril were held.  It is unclear if \nthe extra small pills that she took were lisinopril or aspirin, \nbut it was certain that she took extra Cartia XT.  She was also \nsupported with IVF.  Her HR, BP, and dysarthria gradually \nimproved during the remainder of her hospital stay.  Her serial \nneurological exam was without focal findings.  Her blood sugar \nwas monitored closely as overdose of calcium channel blocker can \nlead to inhibition of insulin release (hyperglycemia after OD is \na poor prognostic indicator).  Her blood sugar remained below \n200.  Her vital signs remained stable, and patient was \ndischarged with instruction to restart her lisinopril and Cartia \nXT on the day after discharge.  Home services were arranged to \nassist patient in medication arrangement as well as physical \ntherapy.  This should be followed up by her primary care \nphysician.  \n\n2. Acute vs. chronic kidney disease.  Crt was found to be \nelevated at 1.6 as compared to 1.2 in ___.  Unclear if this \nis chronic or acute given her length of stay since there is no \ndata point between ___ and ___.  However, she did receive IV \nfluid (NS) for presumed pre-renal state as a result of the \nhypoperfusion state secondary to Cartia XT and possible \nlisinopril OD.  This can be further evaluated by patient's \nprimary care doctor.    \n\n3. Thyroid goiter.  This is an incidental finding on chest \nX-ray.  Patient has no known history of goiter, but this likely \nhas been present for some time.  Given the likely chronic nature \nof the goiter, this can be further evaluated by patient's \nprimary physician in the outpatient setting.  \n\n4.  Hyperkalemia, likely secondary to overdose of home \nmedication and poor forward flow.  This resolved with treatment \n(D50, 10 units of regular insulin, 30 g of Kayexelate, 2L IVF) \nfrom the emergency department and holding of her home \nmedications.  EKG did not show changes typical of hyperkalemia.  \nThis can be followed up by patient's primary care physician.\n\n5.  Fall, witnessed.  During the hospital stay, patient's health \naid reported that patient was sitting on the side of the bed and \nslipped slowly to the floor.  The aid was able to catch and \nsupport patient and lower her to the floor (hips on the ground). \n Thus, patient was unharmed.  She did not hit her head or lose \nconsciousness.  She denied any pain, tenderness, \ndizziness\/lightheadedness, chest pain, palpitation.  Her \nphysical exam after the incident was unremarkable and \nessentially the same as prior.  Her neurological exam was also \nunchanged.  No further work-up was done.  She was instructed to \nget out of bed and ambulate with assist only.  Physical therapy \nalso recommended home ___.

Several benign intraosseous hemangiomas are noted \nas above. \n3. Lumbar metastasis L4 and L5 vertebral bodies as identified on \nthe prior \nPET.  No new lumbar metastasis are identified. \n4. Left iliac wing innumerable hepatic metastatic lesions are \nnoted. \n5. Mild thoracic and lumbar degenerative disc disease. \n\nMRI Head w\/o contrast ___: \nIMPRESSION: \n1. Multiple calvarial metastases measuring up to 5.4 cm with \nmass effect on \nthe right temporal lobe. The dominant metastasis demonstrates \nfoci of \nhemorrhage consistent with documented  thyroid primary \nmalignancy.  No midline \nshift or herniation. \n2. No intra-axial metastases identified. \n3. No intracranial hemorrhage or infarction. \n\nMR ___ spine ___: \nIMPRESSION: \nSevere C5 pathologic compression fracture with severe focal \nkyphosis,\nretropulsion\/protrusion into the spinal canal, severe spinal \ncanal narrowing,\nand posterior displacement of the cord, but no definite cord \ncompression or\nfocal cord signal abnormality.\n \nPATHOLOGY:\n-Bone biopsy:\nLeft iliac bone, biopsy: Metastatic carcinoma consistent with\nthyroid origin. See note.\nNote: Tumor cells have a Hurthle cell appearance consistent with\nspread from a Hurthle cell\ncarcinoma. Tumor cells are positive for PAX8, cytokeratin\ncocktail, TTF-1, thyroglobulin (weakly),\nand CD10. They are negative for Glypican, Heppar, CK20,CK7,\nSynaptophysin, and chromogranin.\nDrs. ___ have reviewed this case.\n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ female with a past medical history significant for newly \ndiagnosed metastatic thyroid cancer, panic disorder with \nagoraphobia, depression, psychosis, near-complete refusal of \npreventative care, obesity, and chronic pain. She was recently \ndischarged (___) after being admitted for pain control and \nfor bone biopsy under anesthesia, admitted again for further \npain management, found to have unstable C-spine in setting of \nmass compression.\n\n#Metastatic thyroid cancer\n#C-5 metastatic lesion\/pathologic fracture: Biopsy from her \niliac bone from her last admission demonstrated Hurthle cell \nthyroid carcinoma. MRI obtained ___ showed effacement of C5 and \nC5 pathological compression fracture as well as multiple \ncalvarian brain mets. She has L hand numbness\/weakness thought \nto be a consequence of the brain lesion vs. the cervical spinal \nlesion.  Per rad onc, the C5 area is very precarious and \nradiation without surgical stabilization first could cause \nfracture and\/or paralysis. She was started on IV dexamethasone \n4mg q6h which was switched to PO on discharge. We had many \ndetailed discussions with the patient and her husband with \nneurosurgery, rad-onc, palliative care, ___, and medicine \nteams in which patient and husband were informed about the risks \nand benefits of cervical stabilization surgery, radiation vs \ncomfort care. The patient understands that if she leaves the \nhospital without surgical stabilization of the cervical spine, \nshe is at risk of c-spine fracture, paralysis, and death. The \npatient understands these risks and would like to leave the \nhospital to enjoy this time with her family and discuss with \nthem to make a decision about her treatment moving forward. She \nunderstands that there really are two options 1. Surgical \nstabilization of the cervical spine followed by radiation \ntherapy vs. 2. A more palliative, comfort focused approach. She \nhas been consistent throughout all of these meetings in her \nabsolute refusal to proceed with any surgical intervention.  Per \nthe ___ team, further management of her widely metastatic \ncarcinoma would include thyroidectomy surgery and thyroid \nsuppression.  Either way, in order to pursue more aggressive \ntreatment, she would need to first proceed with extensive \nC-spine stabilization surgery.   Pt and husband expressed \nunderstanding of her difficult situation and precarious cervical \nspine.   However, they did not feel ready to have hospice come \ninto their home and wanted to first discuss her situation with \nher sons and extended family.  We have set up ___ services \nwith the plan for bridge to hospice when she feels they are \nready.  She will follow up with Dr. ___ (appointment \npending), palliative care (appointment pending), and pending \nfurther discussions, rad\/onc and\/or neurosurgery as well.\n\n# CHRONIC PAIN ___ METASTATIC DISEASE Patient was recently \nadmitted (discharged on ___ for pain management & inpatient \nbiopsy under anesthesia from ___ to ___. During this \nadmission her home Oxycontin was increased from 10 mg to 20mg \nBID and she was continued on PRN oxycodone. Palliative care also \nmet with patient to assist with pain control and goals of care \ndiscussions. She was admitted this admission due to uncontrolled \npain on that regimen. Palliative care was involved the entire \ntime. We initially tried a PCA pump of dilaudid, which was not \neffective because the patient was not pressing the button enough \ndue to anxiety about overdosing. We then switched her back to \nall oral pain medications, replacing some prn doses with \nstanding doses, which resulted in excellent pain control for the \npatient without her having to worry too much about asking for \nprn's. On discharge, the patient feels almost completely pain \nfree, even when up walking around with ___. It seems that the \npatient gets confused about prn doses and does much better with \nhigher doses of standing doses. The patient preferred that we \nkept the regimen exactly the same for discharge. We have also \noutlined above the exact times she should take all of her \nmedications to simplify it for her. This regimen is:\n- Oxycontin 30mg TID\n- Oxycodone 10mg q6h standing\n- Oxycodone 10mg q4h prn breakthrough pain (has not used)\n- Gabapentin 300mg PO TID\n- Acetaminophen 650mg Q6hrs standing\n\n# CHRONIC MICROCYTIC ANEMIA \n# HISTORY OF ___ DEFICIENCY \nPatient has a history of anemia (likely multifactorial in \nsetting of ___ deficiency and anemia of chronic disease in setting \nof malignancy). It has downtrended during this admission, with \nHb low of 6.3. There were no signs of active bleeding. Patient \ndeclined blood transfusion as she has always declined in the \npast. There is likely a component of iron-deficiency given \nferritin of 17 in setting of extensive disease. She was given IV \nferric gluconate 125mg x 2 days. PO ferrous sulfate 325mg BID \nwas held due to concern for GI side effects. Can consider \nrestarting as outpatient.\n\n# HYPERKALEMIA\nK elevated to 6.0 on ___. Gave calcium, insulin, and dextrose \nwith decline of K to 4.3.  Ace-inhibitor was stopped and renal \nfunction remained stable with mild CKD.  Potassium on discharge \nwas 5.0. We suspect there is a component of hemolyzing, as she \nhad many blood draws with mildly elevated potassium in the \nmorning and the whole blood potassium recheck returned within \nnormal range without any intervention.\n\n# Depression, anxiety, psychosis: \nPatient endorses panic attacks and trauma associated with\nhospitals. She gets very anxious about bad news. We continued \nher home sertraline, seroquel, and valium. Her anxiety also \nimproved significantly with pain control as well. The Paient was \nin communication with her psychiatrist Dr. ___ while in \nhospital. Per patient's request, the team initially told the \npatient's husband about any big news first, and allowed him to \nrelay it to her in a more \"gentle\" way. However, as time went \nby, the patient came more to terms with the fact that she has \ncancer and is now more accepting of news about her cancer. On \ndischarge, patient is aware of the state of her disease (thyroid \ncarcinoma with full body mets), the risks of leaving the \nhospital without surgical stabilization of her spine (which \ninclude paralysis and death), and her treatment options \n(palliative vs surgery\/radiation).\n\nCHRONIC MEDICAL PROBLEMS\n========================\n# HYPERTENSION\nPatient has a known history of hypertension treated with \nlisinopril. However, her lisinopril was again held due to \nhyperkalemia (see above). We will hold her lisinopril for now \nespecially given her normotension and it should be re-evaluated \nas outpatient.\n\n# HLD: \nContinued home statin and aspirin\n\n# COPD: \nContinued home advair and albuterol\n\n# GERD: \nIncreased home omeprazole to 40mg daily due to initiation of \nDecadron (see problem 1 above)\n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\n===================\n-Discharge labs: K 5.0, Hb 6.3, Cr 1.4\n-NEW MEDICATIONS: Dexamethasone 4mg q6h, Bisacodyl 10 mg PO \nBID:PRN Constipation\n-CHANGED MEDICATIONS: Omeprazole 20mg daily to 40mg daily, \nOxycontin 20mg BID to 30mg TID, Oxycodone q3h prn breakthrough \nto Oxycodone 10mg q6h standing with 10mg q4h prn breakthrough. \n-STOPPED MEDICATIONS: Lisinopril, Ferrous Sulfate 325 mg PO BID \n-Specialist followup: palliative care, heme-onc, and pending \nfurther discussions: rad-onc +\/- neurosurgery\/spine\n[ ] Consider tapering decadron as outpatient \n[ ] We increased her omeprazole to 40 mg daily from 20 mg daily \ngiven her steroid dosing\n[ ] Consider adding back PO iron\n[ ] Monitor Hb and K\n[ ] monitor pain control and adjust as tolerated.\n[ ] BRAF mutation stain is pending (requested by heme-onc)\n[ ] If concerned about sedation from opiates (we have not seen \nany oversedation), could consider prescribing narcan for home.\n[ ] initiated ___ services with overall plan to bridge to home \nhospice if patient would like- she will discuss with family and \nget back to Dr. ___\n\n#CODE: FULL\n#CONTACT: ___ (___) \n\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

Clopidogrel was stopped. After leaving the ICU, he has a \nureteral stent placed by radiology, and was transferred to the \nfloor. On the floor, he continued to have diarrhea. C diff was \npositive. GI was consulted, who recommended starting PO \nvancomycin and continuing to hold budesonide until he was \nfurther evaluated by his outpatient cardiologist. In the setting \nof diarrhea, a troponin was checked, and found to be elevated to \n0.05 (repeat troponins ranged between 0.05 and 0.09), and an EKG \nshowed new T-wave inversions in V1-V3. The patient was \nasymptomatic and able to climb multiple flights of stairs \nwithout symptoms. Cardiology reviewed his case, and given high \nrisk of rebleeding from his ulcer with a cardiac catheterization \nor further DAPT , it was determined that patient would follow up \nwith his outpatient cardiologist on ___ (though I requested he \nmaker a sooner appointment) for further risk stratification.  \nThe patient was counseled that he should report to the ER with \nany cardiac symptoms, or a return of his nausea and vomiting.\n\n1. UGIB. The patient will follow up with gastroenterology in 2 \nweeks for a repeat endoscopy with biopsy. In the meantime, he is \nbeing discharged on pantoprazole BID. An H pylori is pending.\n\n2. Recurrent C Diff diarrhea\n3. Microscopic colitis\nUnclear to what extent the patient is colonized versus infected, \nand his diarrhea did get worse after stopping budesonide. ID was \nconsulted, and he was started on PO vancomycin. He will continue \nthis as an outpatient until he sees his outpatient \ngastroenterologist, who will make a decision to taper versus \nrestarting budesonide. At that time, he should also be \nconsidered for a repeat colonoscopy.\n\n4. CAD\n5. NSTEMI (likely demand ischemia)\nThe patient did not complain of cardiac symptoms during his \nhospitalization. However, on HD#3 he did complain of some \nnausea, and a troponin was sent (0.05). An EKG showed TWIs in \nV1-V3, new since ___. His troponin did not clear during his \nhospitalization (0.09 on discharge). I discussed his case and \nreviewed with cardiology. This most likely represents demand \nischemia (T2NSTEMI). Given no unstable symptoms (in fact no \nsymptoms at all), patient would not currently be a candidate for \nangiography given his high risk of rebleed if stent placement \nwas necessary. This was discussed with the patient, and in lieu \nof waiting in the hospital, he elected to discharge home with \noutpatient follow up with his cardiologist (scheduled on ___, \nbut patient will try to push up appointment). He was instructed \nto return to the emergency room if he developed any symptoms of \nchest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, or vomiting. He was \ndischarged on aspirin, lisinopril, and metoprolol, and \nclopidogrel was stopped.\n\n6. Ureteral stone. Patient had a cystoscopy and left ureteral \nstent placed on ___. He will follow up as an outpatient \nwith urology for definitive treatment. He was discharged on \ntamsulosin and pyridium as needed, and a lidocaine patch for \ncomfort.\n\n7. Anxiety: Patient was continued on home trazodone 50 mg PO QHS \nPRN insomnia and bupropion SR 150 mg PO BID.\n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\n\n1) Patient needs to follow up with his outpatient cardiologist \nre: outpatient risk stratification, timing of angiography\n2) Outpatient follow up with GI for endoscopy, colonoscopy, \ndecision about oral vancomycin and resuming budesonide\n3) Outpatient follow up with urology\n\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

This was treated with clips and an injection of epinephrine. You were started on a medicine called a proton pump inhibitor (pantoprazole) to treat the ulcer. You will need to take this twice a day. The ulcer was likely caused by your heart medications aspirin and Plavix (clopidogrel). You should stop your clopidogrel (Plavix). You will need to see your gastroenterologist in ___ weeks for a repeat endoscopy, to see how the ulcer is healing, and also to take a biopsy to look for infection or cancer. We also diagnosed you with cdiff colitis; it is unclear whether this is your microscopic colitis or an active infection. In any event, you will be treated with vancomycin until you see your gastroenterologist, who will make a decision regarding continuing a taper of your vancomycin and restarting your budesonide. You also had a ureteral stone treated with ureteral stent with urology and you will need f\/u for this. Finally, a troponin (cardiac enzyme) was checked while you were in the hospital, and it was mildly positive. I checked an EKG that showed new signs of potentially a small heart attack. I discussed with cardiology, and given your recent GI bleed we would recommend work up after your ulcer has improved, since if you needed a stent you would need anticoagulation and antiplatelets that would make you bleed more. You otherwise had no symptoms."}

She was \ndriving her car into a parking lot when she hit another car that \nwas crossing her path.  She had on her seatbelt but her airbag \ndidn't deploy.  Per the patient she did not hit her head or pass \nout but she did hit her knee on the dashboard and felt herself \ngo forward then get caught by the belt and get pulled back.  She \nimmediately noticed knee and neck pain, but thought these were \nrelatively minor so she didn't seek medical care immediately.  \nApproximately two days after the accident she began to notice \ncentral chest pain from approximately the the neck down to just \nabove her breasts.  This never radiated to her arms, back, or \nneck.  It worsened with reaching above her head. It was not \nassociated with exertion.  She denies any diaphoresis or \ndyspnea.  She denies any fevers\/chills\/or night sweats.  She \ndenied orthopnea, PND, syncope, presyncope, and exertional \ncalf\/leg pain.  She denied any history of stroke like symptoms, \nDVT or PE.  She denies ever having chest pain on exertion.  \n.\nHer knee pain has worsened since the accident with it now going \nto 6 or 7 when she bears full weight on it.  For this reason she \nhas not been bearing full weight on it.  She denies any locking, \ncatching, or clicking.  She denies any loss of stability or \ngiving out.  She has noticed some swelling that has increased.  \nShe has never injured the knee in the past.  \n.\nShortly after her accident she made an appointment with her \nprimary care provider to be seen for her knee pain.  As it was \nlate in the evening she was sent to the ED to obtain radiographs \nto rule out acute fracture.  In the ED all vital signs were \nstable.  They took knee and chest radiography, which showed no \nfracture or acute pulmonary process, but since she had \ncomplained of chest pain and had a history of diabetes she was \nadmitted to rule out myocardial infarction. On the floor she \ndenied any chest pain but continued to complain of right knee \npain.   \n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Patient denies abdominal pain, melena, \nhematochezia, nausea, constipation or diarrhea.  She denies \ncough, shortness of breath, and hemoptysis.  She denies \nexertional dyspnea.  She denies paresthesias, headache, \ndiploplia, or any neurologic complaints.

Family reported that the patient was acting not \n\"quite like himself\" but was close to his baseline by time of \narrival on the floor. Differential included infection, \nelectrolyte abn, medication induced, organic CNS process.  \nElectrolytes wnl limits, no new meds, CT head with no \nhemorrhage\/acute process. Patient with indwelling foley catheter \nwhich is a likey nidus for infection which could explain his \nmental status changes.  U\/A was indicative of a UTI and patient \nwas initially treated with Ceftriaxone\/Vancomycin emperically. \nOf note, recent ___ culture data for UTI showed enterococcus.  \nThought patient had a new UTI vs. an old UTI that was not fully \ntreated. However, he remained afebrile and final urine culture \nshowed no growth of bacteria and antibiotics were discontinued.  \nMost likely, the cause of AMS was transient hypotensive episode. \n Once patient was fluid resuscitated in the ER as below, mental \nstatus improved to baseline.  Oriented to self, hospital, month, \nyear, can say days of the week backwards. \n. \n# Hypotension: Patient was noted to have SBP to ___ at rehab on \nmorning of admission.  In ED, SBP was 89 on arrival and he \nreceived 2L NS.  Patient responded well with SBPs in the 130s.  \nHypotension was likely in the setting of dehydration, not \nconcerned for septic shock as patient afebrile, no \nleukocytosis,no longer hypotensive.\n. \n# Bloody bowel movement: Per nursing patient had a \"large bloody \nbowel movement\" on ___. Patient remained hemodynamically stable \nand there was no change in his cognition.  Hematocrit was \nstable.  Patient did not have any repeat episodes of bloody bms \nor melena.  Perhaps this was a hemorrhoidal bleed.  Less likely \ndiverticular vs. angiodysplasia.  As no repeat bloody bms and \nhct remained stable, no interventions were pursued. \n.\n# Pericardial effuison: Patient with known pericardial effusion \nnoted on TTE at ___ ___.  Concern for tamponade when renal \nfellow heard friction rub on physical exam while the patient was \nin hemodialysis. TTE showed minimal pericardial fluid with no \nsigns of tamponade. \n.\n# Elevated troponin: Was 0.22 in the ER.  Given pt has ESRD on \nHD, likely had mild heart strain in setting of poor renal \nfunction.  Recent trop at PCP office was 0.18 and ECG today with \nno ST changes, so very low concern for ACS. Repeat Trop \n0.23-->0.22.  No concern for ACS during this admission.\n.\n# Atrial fibrillation: New onset paroxysmal afib in ___, \nopted against anticoagulation with coumadin after diagnosis \ngiven fall risk.

For the low blood pressure, you were given some fluids through an IV. You had a CAT scan of your head which did not show any new changes. You also had a chest x-ray which did NOT show pneumonia. Initially, we thought your confusion was secondary to a urinary tract infection and we treated you with antibiotics. However, the final result of the urine test showed that you DID NOT have an infection. Most likely, your confusion was secondary to a low blood pressure. After receiving fluids, your blood pressure improved and your mental status improved as well. You also had an ultrasound of your heart which showed that you still have a small to medium size fluid collection as you did at ___. The fluid collection does not seem to be enlarging or impacting your heart function. During the hospitalization, you had a dark brown stool which was concerning for having old blood in it. Your blood counts were stable which was reassuring. Before discharge, you received a unit of blood because of your chronic anemia."}

He has been getting out of bed less than \nusual.  His food and liquids intake has dropped drastically to \n___ Boost drinks per day and approximately 8 ounces of water.  \nHe has been vomiting most liquids.  Although he has not had \nsubjective fevers, chills, or rigors, his wife measures his \ntemperature daily, which was 102.7F today (101 1 day prior to \nadmission, and 99 2 days prior to admission, with a baseline of \n98).\n\nHis renal transplant was in ___.  He is currently on \nprednisone, cellcept and Rapamune.  He also has a history of \nurinary tract infections including vancomycin-resistance \nenterococcus, klebsiella pneumoniae complicated by urosepsis.  \nHe has had grangrene and ulcers on his lower extremities that \nhave resulted in amputations.  Wound cultures have grown mixed \norganisms as well as pseudomonas aeruginosa.\n\nIn the ED, vital signs were T 99.7 HR 83 BP 134\/53 RR 18 O2sat \n94% on rooma air and 97% on 2L by nasal cannula.  Labs were \nnotable for a K of 2.9, WBC of 10.9, Hct of 28.0, and Cr of 4.2 \nfrom his recent baseline of 2.2.  Electrocardiogram showed \nnormal sinus rhythm with evidence of his old left bundle branch \nblock.  Chest X-ray was not consistent with pneumonia and \nrevealed mild CHF with cardiomegaly and prominent pulmonary \nvasculature.  Urinalysis results were significant for negative \nnitrates, but moderate leukocytes, many bacteria, ___ WBC, ___ \nRBC and no EPIs.  A renal ultrasound revealed no hydronephrosis \nor renal mass, no perinephric collections, persistently abnormal \nrenal vasculature due to markedly decreased diastolic flow, \nwhich may be slightly improved in comparison to the study from \none year prior, and normal renal venous flow.\n    He was given 1L of normal saline and 40 mEq of K PO for a K \nlevel of 2.9.

Tricompartmental osteoarthritis.\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nThis ___ year-old male with multiple medical problems including \ninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, hypertension, peripheral \nvascular disease status post lower extremity vascular grafts, \ngrangrenous infections and above the knee amputation,  renal \ntransplant, and history of UTIs and urosepsis who presented with \nfatigue, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and fever.  \n\n# Fever: The patient had a temperature 102.7 F at home on day of \nadmission, and has been afebrile besides a temperature of 100.7 \nF.  The differential considered for this was his urinary tract \ninfection (UTI), bacteremia, pneumonia, wound infections, \ncellulitis or osteomyelitis.  His UTI was treated with \nciprofloxacin.  His blood cultures showed no growth to date.  \nTwo chest x-rays were negative for pneumonia.  There were no \napparent infections of wounds or ulcerating lesions.  The \npatient did, however, have left lower leg cellulitis, which may \nhave responded to broad empiric antibiotic for the UTI using \nlinezolid and ciprofloxacin.  He was continued on his daily \ndosing of his Bactrim prophylactic dose, which may be treating \nhis cellulitis to some extent.  The patient had significant \nlong-standing pain in his left knee.  X-ray of the knee only \nrevealed arthritis.  Further work-up of osteomyelitis was deemed \nunwarranted.  Patient was afebrile after the second day of his \ninpatient stay and remained so throughout.\n\n# UTI: The patient has a urinalysis positive for many bacteria \nthat were identified on culture as Proteus Mirabilis sensitive \nto ciprofloxacin.  This was initially empirically treated with \nciprofloxacin and linezolid to cover gram-negative rods and \nvancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE), which this patient has \nhad before.  When cultures returned positive for Proteus \nlinezolid was discontinued, and ciprofloxacin HCl 750 PO q24h \nwas continued for a 14-day course. Ultrasound did not reveal \nabscesses of the renal transplant.  This is the patient's first \nurinary tract infection occurring without a Foley catheter in \nplace.  He may have been predisposed to this because of his \nbenign prostatic hypertrophy.  We recommended follow-up with his \nPCP regarding this, with potentially reevaluation by urology.\n\n# Acute Renal Failure: The patient had a creatinine (Cr) \nincrease to 4.2 from a recent baseline of 2.2, but is trending \ndown here (3.9,3.7,3.2 to 2.8) after fluid bolusing and \nintermittent IV fluid administration.  Given this patients \nrecent poor PO intake and continuation of thiazide and \nfurosemide diuretics, he was likely in pre-renal failure.  The \nFeUrea of 26 confirmed his prerenal state.  There may be an \nintrinsic component to his renal failure such as ATN.  This can \nbe further evaluated if the patient's Cr does not return to \nbaseline.  Lasix and Metolazone were not restarted prior to \ndischarge but should be addressed prior to discharge from rehab.\n\n# End-stage renal disease with renal transplant - A renal \nultrasound suggested that his transplant kidney was \nwell-perfused. The Cr increase was likely prerenal failure \nalthough intrinsic renal failure is also possible.  His \nrapamycin level was found to be in the therapeutic range.  He \nwas continued on Mycophenolate Mofetil 250 mg PO BID, PredniSONE \n3 mg PO DAILY, Sirolimus (rapamycin) 3 mg PO HS, \nSulfameth\/Trimethoprim DS 1 TAB PO QMOWEFR for prophylaxis, and \nDoxercalciferol 2.5 mcg PO DAILY. Epoetin Alfa was increased to \n8000 UNIT Q 5 days.  Ferrous Sulfate 325 mg PO DAILY was held \ngiven the potential of Fe to cause nausea.  His Mycophenolate \n(CellCept) dose was decreased to 250mg BID, as this was also \npotentially contributing to his nausea.  His rapamycin level was \nfound to be therapeutic upon admission and throughout his \nadmission.  The patient has a scheduled follow-up appointment \nwith Dr. ___ nephrologist.\n\n# Nausea & Anorexia: The etiology of this patient's nausea is \nunclear, but may be multifactorial.  He was in acute renal \nfailure, and his urema may be contributing.  Additionally, he is \nill from his UTI.  His iron supplement and mycophenolate may \nalso contribute to nausea.  The patient has also previously been \nanorectic with unclear etiology that responded to \nantidepressants and mirtazapine.  During this hospital stay, the \npatient's appetite was decreased but a tolerated Boost drinks.  \nHis nausea was treated compazine.  His UTI was treated as \nindicated above.  He was rehydrated for his prerenal failure and \nhis Cr trended down.  His iron supplementation was held.  His \nCellCept (mycophenolate) dose was decreased to 250mg BID, as the \nrenal team felt that his transplant was longstanding and did not \nrequire higher dosing of this medication.  The patient was also \nrestarted on mirtazapine.  Iron should be restarted once \ntolerating better oral intake.\n\n# Respiratory: The patient was admitted with a cough and an \noxygen requirement.  His chest x-ray was negative for pneumonia. \n The patient also complained of malaise.  Viral respiratory \npanel test was sent, which was negative for influenza and other \nrespiratory viruses.  Because the patient was initially febrile \nand had some leg swelling, ___ was performed, which was \nnegative.  His oxygen requirement did not significantly change, \nand physical therapy found that his oxygenation was stable with \nactivity.  He was successfully weaned to room air and did not \nrequire supplementation upon discharge.\n\n# Left lower extremity erythema: The patient described his \nerythema and crusting as long-standing.  The erythema, however, \nimproved on ciprofloxacin and linezolid.  After discontinuing \nlinezolid, the patient's Sulfameth\/Trimethoprim dose was changed \nto single strength daily for prophylaxis and further treatment \nof cellulitis was not pursued.\n\n# Pressure ulcers: The patient has a pressure ulcer over right \nbuttock and new skin breakdown over his lateral right lower \nextremity likely secondary to immobility.  Lesions are without \ninduration, tenderness to palpation, or fluctuance.  The patient \nwas moved out of bed to his chair at least daily to prevent \nprogression of these lesions.  They were monitored daily and \nappropriately dressed.  These should continue to be monitored by \nrehab staff with dressings as appropriate.\n\n# Depression: Patient confirms mood has been 'sour' for ___ \nyears and that he has little motivation, and little interest in \ndaily activities.  He was on Remeron (mirtazapine) in the past \nwith some improvement and discontinued it because he felt \nbetter.  The patient was restarted on Remeron 15mg QHS and \nCitalopram 10mg daily.\n\n# Diabetes Mellitus: The patient's blood glucose level was \nmonitored throughout his hospitalization, with good control. The \npatient takes 60U Lantus qhs at home but uses half the dose at \nhome when his food intake is poor.  Given his nausea and poor PO \nintake, we initially maintained him on Lantus 30U qhs with \nminimal use of the insulin sliding scale.  This was increased to \n50U daily with advancing of this diet.\n\n# Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure was elevated early \nduring the hospitalization.  His dose of Metoprolol Tartrate 75 \nmg PO to BID was increased to 100mg TID dosing.  He was \ncontinued on Amlodipine 10 mg PO DAILY.  Hydralazine was also \nadded given continued hypertension.  Upon discharge his SBP was \napproximately 140.  Lasix and Metolazone were continued to be \nheld as above.\n\n# Vascular disease:  The patient had no problems directly \nrelated to his vascular disease.  He was maintained on his \noutpatient regimen of Aspirin 81 mg PO DAILY, Niacin SR 500 mg \nPO HS, and Atorvastatin 40 mg PO DAILY.\n\n# Osteoarthritis: The patient initially reported pain all over \nhis body that was likely consistent with malaise.  His knee pain \nwas ___ but reportedly at his baseline.  His pain was managed \nwith Percocet and Dilaudid, and improved throughout the hospital \nstay.  A knee XR confirmed tricompartmental arthritis. ESR 97 \nand CRP>300 did raise the concern for infectious or \nrheumatologic process.  There was no remark of osteomyelitis on \nknee x-ray, which should be apparent in long-standing \nosteomyelitis.  We recommend outpatient rheumatology evaluation \nfor this patient.\n\n# Benign prostatic hypertrophy:  The patient had a Foley placed \nin the emergency department, but this was removed soon after \narrival on the floor.  He was able to urinate throughout his \nhospitalization without issues.  It is unclear why the patient \nis on 2 alpha-blocker medications but one may be for his \nhypertension.  He was continued on Doxazosin 2 mg PO HS and \nTamsulosin 0.4 mg PO HS.  He had no symptoms of hypotension \nduring this admission.  The patient's prostate enlargement may \nhave contributed to his urinary tract infection.  We recommend \noutpatient evaluation by urology for possible post-void residual \nurine that may be contributing to a predisposition for UTIs.\n\n# Diastolic heart dysfunction:  The patient was continued on his \noutpatient regimen of Isosorbide Mononitrate (Extended Release) \n90 mg PO DAILY.  Lasix and metolazone were held given the \npatient's prerenal state on admission.\n\n# Constipation: The patient was initially constipated and \ndeveloped lower abdominal pain that resolved after initiation of \na bowel regimen. \n\n# Anemia: The patient's hematocrit was approximately 30 \nthroughout the admission, with a baseline range of mid-20s to \nmid-30s.  Anemia workup in ___ low TIBC, low TRF, low Fe, \nnormal Ferritin, and high haptoglobin.  His high haptoglobin may \nhave been an inflammatory marker.  The patient's erythropoietin \ndose was increased to 8000 units.  Iron supplementation was held \nbecause of the patient's nausea.\n\nProphylaxis: Pantoprazole; and heparin 5000U SC for DVT PPX\n\nDispo - Physical therapy evaluated the patient and found him to \nbe significantly deconditioned, requiring rehabilitation.\n\nCODE - FULL (confirmed with patient)\n\nCommunication - We communicated with the patient's wife \nregularly at the following home number. ___\n \nMedications on Admission:\n1.

You were found to have a urinary tract infection. This was treated with an antibiotic called ciprofloxacin. Your dehydration resulted in decreased function of your kidney transplant. We temporarily stopped your water pills (Lasix & Zaroxolyn) and your kidney kidney function improved after giving you IV fluids. Your Lasix and Zaroxolyn were not restarted prior to your discharge. This may be restarted at your rehab if your volume status and oral intake improve. We think your nausea was a result of this decreased kidney function in addition to some of your medications that can cause nausea. We held your iron supplementation and decreased the dose of your CellCept to 250mg twice per day because both of these medications can increase nausea. Please continue these changes as an outpatient. Once you are eating a regular diet, you should restart you iron. Your blood pressure was high and your medication, Metoprolol was increased. You also had Hydralazine added. For your anemia, we increased your dose of Epoetin Alfa to 8000 units every 5 days."}

He was given IVF with resolution of his hypotension \nand leukocytosis. He was admitted to medicine for antibiotic \ntreatment, and was treated with vancomycin and ceftriaxone then \ntransitioned to cefpodixime. His urine culture was contaminated. \nHe was discharged to complete a 10-day course of antibiotics.\n\nACUTE ISSUES\n============\n# Severe sepsis: The patient presented to the ED with a \nleukocytosis, tachycardia, hypotension, lactic acidosis, and \nurinalysis consistent with a UTI. He has a history of UTI with \nE. coli and enterococcus sensitive to vanc and ceftriaxone. The \npatient has a chronic foley which is changed q 6 weeks and was \nchanged on the day of admission prior to his rigors. Pressures \nimproved and lactic acidosis resolved after IVF administration \nin the ED. He was treated with vancomycin and ceftriaxone given \nhis previous culture data, and his leukocytosis resolved on day \ntwo. The patient was transitioned to cefpodoxime PO given that \nhis UA was nitrite positive and was less concerning for an \nenterococcus infection. His UCx was fecally contaminated. He was \ndischarged to complete a 10-day course.\n\n# Hypotension: The patient presented to the ED with hypotension \nwith SBP of 85, potentially secondary to bacteremia in the \nsetting of a UTI and foley change prior to his rigors. His \npressures normalized after fluid and antibiotic administration\n\n# Rigors: The patient presented to the hospital after \nexperiencing rigors while eating lunch. The patient's symptom \nmay represent transient bacteremia. The patient's foley was \nchanged prior to these symptoms, which may have caused \nhematologic seeding of bacteria. He did not have any further \nepisodes.\n\n# Hyponatremia: Initial sodium of 132, potentially due to \nhypovolemic hyponatremia in the setting of poor PO intake. His \nsodium normalized during his course.\n\nCHRONIC ISSUES\n# severe osteoarthritis: treated with standing and PRN APAP. The \npatient required one dose of oxycodone 2.5 mg for further \ncontrol.\n\n# pAF on ASA: Not currently anticoagulated\n - continued aspirin 81 mg daily\n\n# Hx of prostate and bladder cancer c\/b radiation cystitis and \nurethral trauma: Continued chronic foley\n\n# mitral valve prolapse \/ MR: patient has systolic murmur \nconsistent with MR on exam, no crackles heard on limited lung \nexam and no JVP or peripheral edema, however\n\n# HLD: continue home atorvastatin 10 mg daily\n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES\n===================\n#UTI: Patient will need to complete a 10-day course of \ncefpodoxime, through ___.\n#Follow-Up: Discharged over the weekend.

Members of \nher group home brought her to the physician office as they were \nconcerned about her safety in the group home due to lack of oral \nintake, difficulty walking (per report was newly in a wheelchair \nfor last two week). The ED physicians spoke with her brother, \nwho is also her HCP, who per report told them that she had had \nvery poor ___ intake for \"a while\" at the group home, and the \nfamily had been discussing moving her to a facility with a \nhigher-level of care. \n\nPer report, her caregiver stated that her mental status appeared \nat baseline, which was not very communicative. A copy of her PCP \nvisit note accompanies her paperwork and describes that she has \nlost about 35 lbs, and possibly has been vomiting. Her INR was 7 \nrecently and she received vitamin K for that. \n\nBased on a speech and swallow evaluation note from ___ in \nOMR, at that time staff in the group home were concerned about \nthe patient's lack of ___ intake. It was described at that time \nthat the patient was refusing former favorite foods, and would \neat about ___ spoonfulls prior to spitting out solid foods at \nmeals; there was also concern about choking on pills. It was \nalso noted that the patient appeared to regurgitate food after \nmeals (ongoing behavoir for ___ years). It was noted that she had \nlost about 15 pounds due to this behavoir. The evaluation by the \nspeech and swallow team determined that her inadequate ___ intake \nwas possibly secondary to dementia and behavoiral changes, \nalthough further studies were recommended given inability to \nfully evaluate.\n\nAlso of note, patient was admitted in ___ for failure to \nthrive and decreased ___ intake. It was found that she was \nconstipated, and she was tolerating a regular diet prior to \ndischarge.\n\nIn the ED, initially it was difficult to measure the patient's \nblood pressure. Her heart rate was 90, respiratory rate of 14, \nwith difficulty measuring oxygen saturation. First recorded \nblood pressure was 92\/palp, with oxygen saturation of 100%. \nPatient was lethargic but responsive with moaning and crying out \nto verbal stimuli. She was given 2L of NS initially when her SBP \ndropped to 70's and 80's. She was guaiac negative, and a chest \nx-ray was unremarkable. Labs were notable for renal \ninsufficiency, hypernatremia (166), hyperchloremia (124), \nlactate of 9.2, INR of 9.6 (then >11), and leukocytosis of 14.\nA femoral line was placed and patient was given 4L of IVF with \nimprovement to systolics in 100's. However, then patient fell \nasleep and systolic dropped to 70's, so she received an \nadditional 2 liters and levophed was started. She was given \nvancomycin and zosyn, and cultures were drawn. She was also \ngiven 5 mg of IV vitamin K for elevated INR. EKG was without \nconcering changes.

The \nmediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged and within normal \nlimits. The \npulmonary vascularity is normal. The lungs are clear. There is \nno focal \nconsolidation, pleural effusions or pneumothorax. Right upper \nquadrant \nabdominal surgical clips denote prior cholecystectomy. \nIMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality. \n\n___ KUB:\nThere is no evidence of ileus, obstruction, or free air. There \nis \nnormal bowel gas pattern. Clips are seen in the right upper \nabdominal \nquadrant likely from previous cholecystectomy. There is a single \nclip in the left lateral mid abdomen. \nIMPRESSION: No evidence of obstruction or ileus. \n\n___ TTE:\nThe left atrial volume is markedly increased (>32ml\/m2). The \ninteratrial septum is aneurysmal. Left ventricular wall \nthickness, cavity size and regional\/global systolic function are \nnormal (LVEF >55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall \nmotion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly \nthickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic \nregurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are myxomatous. \nThere is moderate\/severe mitral valve prolapse. An eccentric, \nposteriorly directed jet of severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is \nseen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There \nis severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no \npericardial effusion. \nIMPRESSION: Severe prolapse of the anterior leaflet of the \nmitral valve with severe, posteriorly directed mitral \nregurgitation, severe pulmonary hypertension and an inter-atrial \nseptum that is bowed towards the right. Biventricular systolic \nfunction looks normal. There is no pericardial effusion. \n\n___ HEAD CT w\/o CONTRAST:\n1. No acute intracranial hemorrhage or edema. \n2. Marked, disproportionate enlargement of the ___ and left \nmore \nthan right lateral ventricles, with no prior study available for \ncomparison. \n.\n___ MR head \/ MRA:\n1.

Multiple old infarcts again identified, not significantly \nchanged from \nprior CT. \n3. Left vertebral artery not definitely visualized, possibly \noccluded at the \norigin versus hypoplastic artery, consider MRA neck for further \nevaluation. \n.\n___ CXR:  Interval increase in right upper lobe opacification \nconsistent \nwith worsening aspiration or pneumonia. Persistent mild \ncongestive heart \nfailure and bilateral lower lobe air space consolidation. \n.\n___ digoxin level 1.8, WBC 3.8, HCT 28, Na 140, K 4.4, HCO 33, \nCr 0.6, BUN 12\n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nHYPOTENSION:\nUltimately Ms. ___ hypotension was thought to be due to \nprofound volume depletion in the setting of poor ___ intake.  Her \nbaseline SBP was noted to be low in the 100's, according to \nout-patient records. On arrival she was admitted to the ICU. She \nwas started on vancomycin and zosyn for presumed sepsis, though \nshe remained afebrile and no infectious source was identified \n(CXR was unremarkable, abd exam benign, UA\/UCx negative, no \ndiarrhea, no skin lesions).  MAPS's were maintained greater than \n65 on norepinephrine upon admission.  She was gradually weaned \nfrom pressors by ___ and maintained SBP in the 90-100 range \nwhile awake (pressures dropped slightly to the 80's while \nsleeping).  \n.\nOther causes of hypotension were ruled out.  There was no \nevidence of bleeding.  She has known hypothyroidism and is on \nlevothyroxine, but TSH\/free T4 were normal.  She was not \nadrenally insufficient, as she passed a CortStim test.  TTE did \nnot show worsening valvular disease or focal wall motion \nabnormalities; although she had a slight troponin elevation on \nadmission, CK-MB fractions were normal and there was no evidence \nof ischemia on EKG's.  PE was considered unlikley given the \npatient's supratherapeutic INR on admission and good \noxygenation.\n.\nShe was transfered to the medical floor the first time on \n___. She remained asymptomatic there but relatively \nhypotensive. On ___, she received a dose of zyprexa prior to an \nMRI, and her SBP was noted to be drop to the ___. She also has \nfound to have a UTI in the setting of this hypotension. She \nreceived 2L NS with improvement to the ___, and was transferred \nback to the ICU, where levophed was again initiated.  During her \nsecond ICU ___ she was also aggressively diuresed as she had \nevidence ___ body volume overload and anasarca. With her \nknown 4+ MR, it was felt that afterload reduction would improve \nher hemodynamics. She also received a transfusion of 1 unit of \npRBCs to boost her intravascular oncotic pressure. She was \nslowly weaned down off pressors by ___. Of note, she had no \nevidence of hypoperfusion as evidenced by venous lactates of 1.1 \ndespite a MAP in the ___ on one occasion.\n.\nShe was transfered but to the medical floor on ___ where her \nblood pressure remained stable on midodrine with occasional \nbrief hypotensive episodes to the upper ___. Even at these \npressures mental status and urine output were maintained. \nDiuresis with bolus IV lasix was continued and then transfered \nto ___. However it was discontinued on ___ because of increased \nautodiuresis and worsening tachycardia. With improved afib \ncontrol with amio and dig her blood pressures improved to \n120\/80s. When a steady state if dig is reached, downtritration \nof midodrine showed be considered.\n.\nFAILURE TO THRIVE, PEG TUBE PLACEMENT:\nMs. ___ has been noted by family members, group home members \nand her out-pateint doctors to have had FTT over the ___ several \nmonths with profound behavioral changes, including withdrawal \nand refusal to eat.  Within the last year, she had been given a \ndiagnosis of Alzheimer's Dementia (confirmed with neurologist \nDr. ___ in ___).  Per Dr. ___ \nmedical ___ for dementia and behavioral change had been \nnegative, although it was difficult to obtain imaging studies as \nan out-patient due to the patient's inabilit to cooperate with \nthe tests.  Head CT was performed on ___ in-house to complete \na dementia ___ and showed no acute bleed or mass effect, but \nlarge ___ & ___ ventricles.  \n\nOn admission, an NG tube was placed to deliver nutrition \n(albumin was noted to be 2.1), although the patient pulled out \nthe NGT.  Multiple conversations were had with the patient's HCP \n(her brother ___ and sister-in-law about goals of care and the \nfamily's wishes.  It was decided that she should have a PEG tube \nplaced for feeding given her refusal to eat (throughout the \nadmission she refused ___ intake and medications, as well as \nmouth care).  The surgical service placed a PEG tube on ___ \nwithout complication.  Medications were switched to ___ and tube \nfeedings were started on ___. \n\nAfter transfer to the floor Ms ___ had an episode of \nhypoglyemia even with ongoing Tube feeds without residuals. \nFinger sticks were monitored, however no further hypoglyemia was \nnoted.\n.\nASPIRATION PNEUMONIA:\nDuring her second MICU stay she remained on TFs via her PEG \ntube. She did become nauseated and vomited x 1 on ___, with an \nassociated desaturation and increased O2 requirement. It was \nfelt c\/w an aspiration event, and subsequent CXRs were c\/w \naspiration. She was begun on an empiric course of Vanc\/Zosyn for \na possible HAP x 10 day course (___). She was \naggressively diuresed for concern of ARDS, but her O2 \nreuqirement was easily weaned back to baseline. Her paxil was \nd\/c'ed out of concern for any contribution to an altered mental \nstatus.\n.\nATRIAL FIBRILLATION:\nThe patient was on sotalol and warfarin as an out-patient.  INR \nwas 11.3 on admission likely from poor nutritional status.  She \nwas given Vitamin K 5 mg and warfarin was held on admission with \ngradual improvement in INR.  Sotalol was held while not taking \n___ medications; no other rate controlling agents were started \ngiven hypotension, and HR was generally in the 80-90 BPM range.  \nBy ___, her HR had started to climb to the 110-120's with \noccassional increases to the 130-140's (BP remained stable \nduring these episodes).  She was started on IV amiodarone for \nrhythm control on ___ with good effect.  After placement of \nthe PEG tube, she was started on amiodarone 400 mg TID which was \nlater deceased to 200 mg ___ once a loading dose was finished. \n Warfarin  was started on ___.  On ___ tachycardia worsening \nand unresponsive to metoprolol and fluids. Amio was increased to \n400mg ___ and Digoxin was loaded with 0.25mg x 4 IV. This load \nresulted in improved HR control with HR in 80-90s and a large \nincrease IN BPs to 120s\/80s. She is to continue on dig at .125mg \n___. Please have her blood drawn on ___ to \nmeasure her digoxin level. Fax this result to Dr. ___ at \n___ (office phone ___ and obtain \nrecommendation from him regarding dosage changes of this \nmedication. Dr. ___, her long-standing cardiologist, was \naware of the plan to anticoagulate and discharge on ___ \namiodarone and Dig.  He plans to electrically cardiovert in ___ \nweeks after discharge. At the time of d\/c INR had diped to 1.6 \nafter decreasing the dose in the setting of a previously rising \nINR to 2.7. On ___ coumadin was adjusted to previous home dose \nof 1 mg ___. INR is anticipated to rising quickly with this \nadjustment and subsequent increase in amiodarone dosage. INR \nshould continue to be monitored closely.\n\nACUTE RENAL FAILURE:\nGiven history and lab studies, ARF on admission was supsected to \nbe pre-renal in etiology.  In addition to poor ___ intake, she \nwas noted to be on lasix when admitted.  Her baseline creatinine \nfrom ___ was around 1.0, but Cr was 3.4 on admission (with \nBUN 86).  UA\/UCx were negative for infection.  Cr improved to \n0.7 with aggressive hydration. Cr remained stable during her \nlater aggressive diuresis. \n.\nA foley has been in place to prevent decub infection and left in \nat time of transfer. Upon arrival foley should be removed and a \nvoiding trail performed. After ___ void or after 12 hr (which \never comes first) please perform a bladder scan and reinsert \nfoley for residual urine > 450 cc.\n\nUTI:\nE coli urinary tract infection was noted on ___ culture and IV \ncipro was started for a 3 day course\n\nHYPOTHYROIDISM:\nPatient was euthyroid on admission (see above).  She was \ncontinued on levothyroxine 37.5 mcg IV (equivalent to home dose \nof 75 mcg ___ while not taking ___ in-house.  She was changed \nbacked to ___ thyroid replacement. TFTs and PFTs should be \nmonitored as an outpatient with the addition of amiodarone. \n\nQUESTION OF SEIZURE DISORDER, ON DEPAKOTE:\nPatient with unclear history of seizure disorder; home \nmedication list on admission listed trileptal and depakote.  \nHistory was clarified with home neurologist, Dr. ___ \n___, who said patient was on these medications for mood \nstabilization and has no known seizure disorder.  Dr. ___ \n___ initially tried her on triletptal, but this gave her \nhyponatremia; she was later changed to depakote.  While \nin-house, she was maintained on the equivalent dosage of \nvalproic acid because she was not taking ___.  If her mood \nworsens may consider restarted home doses of depakote and \ntrileptal\n\nMental staus: Her mental status has rapidly deterioated over the \nlast year, and PTA was not oriented, responding only with moans \nand simple words. She was diagnosed with alzhemers by her \nneurologist prior to admission. In house a paxil trial has \nattempted, to see if depression treatement would improve mental \nstatus. No improvement was seen and paxil was later d\/ced for \nfear that in was overly sedating. Imaging showed She has \nextensive atrophy of her medial temporal lobes and hippocampus. \nShe also has extensive regions of brain infarction and \nleukoencephalopathy both frontally and cerebellar. Neuro was \nconsulted for management and evaluation for possible \ncommunicating hydrocephalus. Per neuro the hydrocephalus is \nexplained by two preocesses- 1) ex vacuo due to atrophy and \ninfarction of brain tissue and 2) loss of white matter firmness \nand support leads to  further ventricular enlargement. These \nprocesses are not improved by shunting which carries a \nsubstantial risk. Neuro strongly favored not performing an LP or \nconsidering placement of a shunt.  Secondly, her history of \nsedatives before MRI leading to profound hypotension is another \nrisk that may outweigh any benefit.\n.\nPENDING ISSUES FOR ___:\n(1) Needs to follow up with cardiologist Dr. ___  for \n___ and possible elective electric cardioversion and dig \nmanagement\n(2) Patient was discharged on warfarin with goal INR of 2.0 - \n3.0.  INR should be followed closely as recently increased amio \ncould alter metabolism\n(3) Needs a ___ appointment with her PCP ___ ___ weeks \nfollowing rehab discharge.\n(4) Further management of midodrine, and mood stabilizers should \nbe considered\n \nMedications on Admission:\nHome Medications:\n(per office visit note faxed over)\n- Coumadin 1 mg ___\n- Senna 8.6 mg ___\n- Sotalol 120 mg BID\n- Potassium Chloride 40 mEq ___\n- Lasix 40 mg ___\n- Ketaconazole as needed\n- Triamcinolone cream as needed\n- Prilosec 20 mg BID\n- Bacitracin ointment PRN\n- Amoxicillin prior to dental procedures\n- Levothyroxine 75 mcg\n- Lorazepam 1 mg prior to medical procedures\n- Depakote 1500 mg ___\n- Trileptal 300 mg BID\n\n \nDischarge Medications:\n1.

There is no pleural or pericardial \neffusion. Stents have been inserted in the common bile duct and \nproximal pancreatic duct. Pneumobilia and intrahepatic duct \ndilatation is mild, and significantly improved since the CT of \n___, likely secondary to recent common bile duct stenting. \nThere are no focal liver lesions. Gas within the proximal \npancreatic duct (3B:91) is consistent with recent \ninstrumentation. Extensive fat stranding surrounding the \npancreatic head is new and suggestive of acute pancreatitis. The \ndistal common bile duct is now more dilated than on ___ \nmeasuring 11 mm at the level of the mid-to-distal duct (3B:92) \ncompared to ___ when it was collapsed at this level. Mild \npancreatic duct dilatation has not altered since ___. A soft \ntissue mass surrounds the common hepatic artery (3B:86) and, \nwhile difficult to measure, is approximately 13 x 24 mm in size \nand has not changed since ___. The pancreatic head is mildly \nenlarged, a focus of hypoattenuation in the uncinate process on \nthe arterial phase (103b:242) may represent hypoperfusion due to \npancreatitis or may represent a pancreatic mass; this was not \nidentifiable on the non-dedicated CT abdomen of ___. The \nremainder of the pancreatic gland parenchyma appears normal \nexcept for peripancreatic stranding. There are no acute fluid \ncollections. Surgical clips at the level of the porta hepatis \nare consistent with prior resection of the gallbladder. The \nportal vein is narrowed 1 cm distal to the portal confluence \n(400B:24).

Because of recurrent cough \nand CXR showing new LLL infiltrate different from prior CXR, \nalong with a history of \"aspiration\" and poor adherence with \ndiet, she was treated for aspiration pneumomnia. She actually \nfailed treatment for HCAP recently. During this admission, she \nwas treated for aspiration PNA with a full course of Cefepime \nand Flagyl. She seemed to improve subjectively but it was \ndifficult to examine her as she frequently refused. Swallow \nnurses evaluated patient and recommended honey thick liquids and \nsoft solids. She refused video swallow and refused this diet. \nShe initially expressed good insight into her decisision, and \nher wishes were therefore granted. However, she became more \nagitated and very paranoid with paranoid delusions (I am working \nwith the FBI, they stole\/took my baby) and yelling with \nprofanities. She acted like \"hoarders\" keeping empty and full \nsoda cans, papers, trash, food wastes and other items in her \nroom. She was found to be abusing her medications including \nnitroglycerine and hiding them from the nurses staff. She called \nher PCP office several time and was yelling profanities at the \noffice staff, at our nursing staff and at me personally. She \nbecame very distruptive to the medical floor and refused \nexamination. She also called ___ several time and code purple \nwas activated on one ocassion. Psychiatry was reconsulted for \nconsideration of psychiatric admission. It was initially \ndifficult to differentiate delirium from acute psychiatric \nreaction and psychosis, however, it became clear that her \nagitation and paranoia are from psychiatric reaction. This was \nocnfirmed by an EEG which showed no evidence of metabolic or \ntoxic encephalopathy. In addition, repeat CXR and blood tests \nwere all OK. Her exam (refused many times) did not indicate a \n___ medical situation. She was placed on antipsychotic \nmedications and 1:1 sitter. Of note, during admission, social \nwork and case management worked on getting her into \nrehabilitation. This was also at the recommendation of her PCP. \nThere were concerns regarding care at home, though she does have \na home health aid. However, because of her decompensated \npsychiatric situation, she requires an inpatient psychiatric \nadmission. The Medical consult team should be available if any \nof her chronic medical situations decompensate. We had a meeting \nwith her sister who came from ___ regarding plan of care. \nThe meeting was on ___ and took 45 minutes regarding plan \nof care and prognosis. Her sister is not her HCP (her home aid \nis her HCP!). In regards to other medical problems:\n\n1-Left Ulnar Collateral Ligament Sprain\/Osteophyte Fracture: She \nwas assessed by hand surgery and a cast was placed.  However, \nshe demanded it be taken off.  The cast was re-adjusted to no \navail.  She understood the risks of removing the cast.  OT was \nconsulted and changed her cast to a fabricated splint with \nbetter effect. She needs to be seen in Hand Surgery Clinic in ___ \nweeks.\n\n2-Chronic systolic CHF:  She was not found to be volume \noverloaded.  Her Lasix was initially held given renal failure.  \nShe remained euvolemic and her lasix was restarted on ___.\n\n3-Non-Hodgkins lymphoma:  She has follow up with \nHemetology\/Oncology arranged as outpatient.

He was initially treated with an NG tube, \nkept NPO, treated with fluids and Zofran for nausea. However, by \nthe second day of his admission, his symptoms were markedly \nimproved, his NGT was removed and his diet was advanced. \nEndoscopy showed normal mucosa in esophagus, stomach and \nduodenum. MRE showed evidence of unchanged distal small-bowel \nobstruction secondary to the central mesenteric mass. Based on \nthese findings, the patient's clinical improvement, and his \nongoing ascites, surgery decided to hold off on a bypass at this \ntime and see him in follow up as an outpatient.\n\n# Ascites\nPer hepatology evaluation, ascites seems to be multifactorial \ndue to portal hypertension due to the obliteration of his portal \nvein and encasement of his SMA\/SMV by his tumor, as well as \nobstruction of his lymph system contributing to chylous nature \nof the ascites. The liver is unlikely cirrhotic given normal \nLFTs,\nsynthetic function and non-cirrhotic appearance on OSH CT scan. \nFor the concern for chylous ascites (based on patient's \ndescription) as well as overall malnutrition, he was seen by \nnutrition, who recommended a low fat, sodium restricted diet \nwith ensure enlive supplements mixed with beneprotein and 15 mL \nmedium chain triglycerides oil. A triene\/tetraene ratio was also \nchecked with results pending on discharge; if> 0.4 and s\/sx of \ndeficiency consider parenteral fat emulsion. He had a \nparacentesis on the day of discharge, both therapeutic on \nschedule for his weekly tap and also diagnostic to evaluate for \nchylous ascites. Also continued home Lasix 10 mg daily while \ninpatient.\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1. Furosemide 10 mg PO DAILY \n2.

WET READ !!  \nInterval development of bilateral effusions, moderate on the \nleft since \nthe___. Left lower lobe opacity persists and remains concerning \nfor \ndeveloping pneumonia. \n.\nTTE ___\nConclusions  \nThe left atrium is mildly elongated. The estimated right atrial \npressure is ___ mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and \ncavity size are normal. There is mild regional left ventricular \nsystolic dysfunction with akinesis of the distal inferior and \nanterior walls. The apex is akinetic but not aneurysmal. The \nremaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 50 %). Right \nventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The \naortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no aortic \nvalve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral \nvalve leaflets are mildly thickened. Physiologic mitral \nregurgitation is seen (within normal limits). There is moderate \npulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial \neffusion. \nIMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Normal left ventricular \ncavity size with regional systolic dysfunction c\/w CAD (distal \nLAD distribution). Moderate pulmonary artery systolic \nhypertension. \nCLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: \nBased on ___ AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the \necho findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical \ndecisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on \nclinical and echocardiographic data.   \n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nMr ___ is an ___ man with history of hypertension, \nhyperlipidemia, chronic renal insufficiency, presenting with \nsyncope and found to have STEMI.   \n.  \n# Sycope: The cause of his sycope on presentation was thought to \nbe most likely orthostatic hypotension with cerebral \nhypoperfusion given his cerebrovascular disease.  Carotid \nultrasound showed 40-59% stenosis of the internal carotid \narteries bilaterally. He had no further syncopal episodes while \nin house. \n.\n# STEMI:  Patient initially had positive enyzmes and ST \nelevations v2-v6.  He was given ASA, Plavix, Beta blocker, \nheparin gtt.  He was prehydrated for catheterization. \n.\nOn ___, repeat EKG showed STE in lateral leads.  Enzymes \nwere trended and flat. Pt did not have symptoms. Decision was \nmade to send pt to cardiac cath on ___, demonstrating severe \n3 vessel disease. At that point, cardiac surg was consulted for \nCABG. However, during the morning of ___, pt complained of \nback pain and STE returned in his lateral leads. Patient was \nsent again to the cath lab for balloon pump and then transfer to \nthe CCU.\n.\nIn the ccu, the decision was made not to pursue CABG given \nmultiple medical comorbidities.  The patient remained free of \nchest pain.  Medical management including clopidogrel, full dose \naspirin, beta blocker, and high dose statin were undertaken.  He \nwas weaned off the intra-aortic balloon pump and it was removed. \nHe had a femoral bruit, so US was done which showed no evidence \nof pseudoaneurysm.  \n.\nRegarding his coronary disease, the plan was to wait until renal \nfailure resolved and then consider repeat catheterization for \nrevascularization of his LAD.  He would need to have this done \nbefore any urologic procedure (as below).\n.\n# Acute on chronic renal insufficiency: Creatinine on admission \nwas near baseline of 2. After catheterizations, creatinine rose \nto a high of 5.4.  The most likely cause was contrast-induced \nATN. He was hydrated, and renal function improved slowly.  \nCreatinine on discharge was 3.2.  \n.\n# GI bleed:  In the CCU, the patient had guaiac positive stools \nand reported a history of melena.  He was given pRBC to maintain \nHct >28.  GI did an upper endoscopy that showeed erosive \ngastritis and duodenitis, likely the source of bleeding.  He was \ngiven BID PPI.  Per GI, this would not preclude heparinization \nfor cardiac procedure if needed.  \n.\n# Renal mass:  On non-contrast abdominal CT, patient was found \nto have a 4 cm L renal mass that was confirmed by ultrasound to \nbe solid.  The urology team evaluated the patient and \nrecommended outpatient follow-up for MR with gadolinium after \nrenal function improves.  After speaking with his nephrologist \n(Dr. ___ at ___, he should NOT get MR \nwith gadolinium at any point but should instead have a contrast \nCT after kidney function improves. He could potentially undergo \nresection, after LAD is revascularized, if the disease is \nlocalized.\n.\n# Mild Chronic Systolic heart Failure: Echo from outside \nhospital showed overall mildly depressed EF of 40-45% but with \nfocal wall motion abnormality.  He was on lasix as an outpatient \nwhich was held because of acute renal failure.  On discharge, he \nwill need to have daily weights and reinstitution of diuretics \nas needed.  \n.  \n# Hypertension: The patient had a history of chronic \nhypertension, likely exacerbated by not taking his clonidine the \nmorning of admission.  He initially received a nitro drip, \ntransitioning to hydralazine and later to home medications \nincluding beta blocker, amlodipine, and clonidine (changed from \ntablet to patch).  Lisinopril was held for renal failure.  He \nwas normotensive on this regimen.  \n.\n# Left orbital edema: The patient had left orbital edema on \nadmission.  Head CT at ___ negative for fracture, no point \ntenderness on exam. The edema resolved within days.\n.  \n# Leukocytosis:  The patient briefly developed leukocytosis.  \nCXR showed a possible L lower lobe infiltrate.  He was afebrile \nand asymptomatic, and the leukocytosis resolved within days.  \nThe most likely cause was aspiration pneumonitis.  He should be \nobserved while eating until his mental status improves to \nbaseline.\n.\n# Hypernatremia:  Sodium the day of discharge was slightly \nelevated at 148.  This will need to be followed at the rehab \nfacility.\n \nMedications on Admission:\nALLOPURINOL - 300 mg Tablet - ___ Tablet(s) by mouth once a day  \n\nAMLODIPINE [NORVASC] - 5 mg Tablet daily  \nCLONIDINE - 0.2 mg Tablet - 1 Tablet(s) by mouth twice a day  \nEPOETIN ALFA [PROCRIT] - 10,000 unit\/mL Solution - 1 ml Qweek -  \n\ndispense 1ml single use vials  \nFUROSEMIDE - 40 mg Tablet - 1 Tablet(s) by mouth twice a day  \nLISINOPRIL - 40 mg Tablet - 1 Tablet(s) by mouth once a day  \nMETOPROLOL SUCCINATE [TOPROL XL] - 200 mg daily  \nSIMVASTATIN - 10 mg Tablet daily  \nFERROUS GLUCONATE - 324 mg (36 mg) daily  \n\n \nDischarge Medications:\n1.

She had an MRI pan-spine to rule out cord compression. \nThis required intubation and general anesthesia as she did not \ntolerate imaging with benzos. She was extubated easily. \nNeurology was consulted and felt the MRI findings could not \naccount for her decline. Given retropulsion on exam, and no \nclear evidence of muscular weakness, neuro felt this is a global \ndecline, such as presenile dementia. To rule out other causes, \nCK, B12, folate, TSH, and depakote level were checked. The TSH \nwas elevated to 11, although T3 and free T4 were normal, \nsuggesting subclinical hypothyroidism.

The LMCA and large \ndominant LCx had no angiographically-apparent flow-limiting \nstenoses.  The small non-dominant RCA had no \nangiographically-apparent flow-limiting stenoses.  The LAD had \nan 80% \nmid-vessel stenosis at the take-off of a moderate-sized diagonal \nbranch. \n2) Limited resting hemodynamics revealed systemic arterial \nnormotension, \nwith a central aortic pressure of 119\/59 mmHg. \n3. Successful PCI to mid-LAD 80% stenosis with a 2.75 x 14 mm \nResolute \nDES leaving no residual stenosis. \n4. Successful closure of right femoral arteriotomy with an \nExoseal \ndevice. \nFINAL DIAGNOSIS:     \n1. One vessel coronary artery disease. \n2. Successful drug-eluting stenting of mid-LAD for primary \ntreatment of \nSTEMI with LBBB. \n\n___ Echo: The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular \nwall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is \nnormal. LV systolic function appears moderatelty-to-severely \ndepressed (ejection fraction 30 percent) secondary to extensive \nsevere hypokinesis\/akinesis of the interventricular septum, \nanterior wall, and apex, with focal apical dyskinesis. No masses \nor thrombi are seen in the left ventricle (Optison). Right \nventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The \nascending aorta is mildly dilated. There are focal \ncalcifications in the aortic arch. The aortic valve leaflets (3) \nare mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild \n(1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are \nmildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) \nmitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are \nmildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic \nhypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. \n\nCompared with the findings of the prior report (images \nunavailable for review) of ___, extensive left \nventricular wall motion abnormalities are now present. \n\n___ ECG: Sinus rhythm. Left bundle-branch block. Possible \nanteroseptal myocardial infarction of indeterminate age. \nCompared to the previous tracing of ___, Q waves are now \nseen in lead V2. Arm lead reversal is not present on the current \ntracing.  TRACING #1  \nRead by: ___. \n  Intervals Axes \nRate PR QRS QT\/QTc P QRS T \n70 ___ 67 42 56 \n\n___ ECG Sinus rhythm with frequent multifocal ventricular \npremature contractions. Left bundle-branch block. Anteroseptal \nmyocardial infarction, age indeterminate. Compared to tracing \n#1, ventricular premature contractions are seen in the current \ntracing. TRACING #2  \nRead by: ___. \n  Intervals Axes \nRate PR QRS QT\/QTc P QRS T \n65 0 ___ 0 -81 82 \n\n___ ECG:Bradycardia with premature atrial contractions. Left \nbundle-branch block. Anteroseptal ST-T wave changes, may be due \nto ischemia. Compared to the tracing earlier in the day, there \nis no terminal T wave inversion suggesting ischemia. The lateral \nST segment depressions have improved towards normal and no \nventricular premature contractions are present on the current \ntracing. TRACING #3  \nRead by: ___. \n  Intervals Axes \nRate PR QRS QT\/QTc P QRS T \n58 ___ 68 47 82 \n\n___ CXR  The lungs are clear, the cardiomediastinal \nsilhouette and hila are normal. There is mild vascular \ncongestion. There is no pleural effusion and no pneumothorax. \nIMPRESSION:  No acute cardiothoracic process. Mild vascular \ncongestion. \n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ year old male with h\/o LBBB, BPH, diverticulitis, and OA who \npresented with the acute onset of epigastric\/chest pain, now s\/p \ncath with ___ of mid-LAD for 80% stenosis and left \nventricular dyskinesis (EF 30%).\n\n# STEMI: Patient was given plavix load (600mg) and bivalirudin \nand quickly brought to the cath lab upon arrival out of concern \nfor STEMI on ECG (difficult to assess given old LBBB). Cardiac \ncatheterization showed 80% stenosis of the midLAD, which was \nstented with a DES. Chest pain and ECG improved after cardiac \ncatheterization. Troponin on arrival was 0.02 (no MB), which \nelevated to 2.71 several hours after catheterization. \nAdditionally, MB after catheterization was 57, and trended down \nshortly after this. Because of this and questionable history of \na week of exertional pain, it was unclear whether the patient \nhad experienced a missed MI (with trops trending down, 0.02 on \narrival and elevation in biomarkers due to myocardial injury \nduring cath) or acute MI that was intervened upon early (with \nCEs increased s\/p cath due to evolving MI). Echo s\/p cath showed \nLV dyskinesis, no thrombus, EF 30%. Patient was monitored on \ntelemetry, started on plavix 75mg daily, ASA 325mg (decreased to \n81mg on d\/c given other anticoagulant and antiplatelet meds), \nmetoprolol tartrate 12.5mg BID (switched to succinate 25mg daily \non d\/c), lisinopril 5mg (decreased to 2.5mg on d\/c given lower \nSBPs), atorvastatin 80mg daily. Phyical therapy saw the patient \nand recommended home cardiac rehab which was set up, along with \n___ and tele monitoring.\n\n# PUMP: Appeared euvolemic on exam without symptoms of CHF, \nalthough CXR shows some evidence of fluid overload. He remained \nsatting in the high ___ on room air, and denies SOB or DOE \nduring admission. Echo on ___ showed EF 30% (no prior), with \nleft ventricular dysfunction. It is unclear whether his \npresentation was of a late MI with premanent infarcted tissue, \nor of an earily MI with cardiac stunning s\/p catheterization and \nstenting. He was started on lisinopril 5mg daily, which was \ndecreased to 2.5mg on discharge given (asymptomatic) systolic \nblood pressures in the ___. Additionally, he was started on \nmetoprolol tartrate 12.5mg BID and converted to succinate 25mg \ndaily, as well as eplerenone 25mg daily with good effect. Given \nhis LV dyskinesis (without evidence fo LV thrombus), he was \nstarted on anticoagulation with warfarin 5mg daily, to be \nmanaged by ___ clinic. INR goal ___. \nHe has follow up with Dr. ___ and \nshould have a repeat echocardiogram to assess improvement in LV \nfunction. \n \n# Abdominal pain: Patient was admitted on a course of \namoxicillin-pot clavulanate 500 mg-125 mg Tablet BID that was \nstarted on ___ for diverticulitis, however he had subsequent \nCT abdomen which was not consistent with this diagnosis. \nEtiology unclear however it is possible these symptoms may have \nbeen an atypical anginal equivalent. Antibiotics were \ndiscontinued on admission given no evidence for diverticulitis \nor other acute intra-abdominal pathology. Patient denied \nabdominal pain during admission. He was started on ranitidine \nfor GI prophylaxis, as he was started on plavix and ASA this \nadmission. \n\n# Pancreatic head lesion: Found on recent abdominal CT. Requires \n___ year follow up with limited single phase CT of the pancreas to \nassess stability. \n\n# BPH: Continued home oxybutynin, terazosin.\n\nTransitional Issues: \n#CODE: Full code, confirmed  \n#EMERGENCY CONTACT: Wife ___ is HCP ___  \nPCP follow up scheduled.

She has been on single agent pemetrexed and \nprior PET scan in ___ showed slight progression of disease. \nHer symptoms began 2 days prior to admission when she awoke with \nleft-sided rib pain under her breast and radiating to her back. \nThe pain was initially minimal, but constant. The pain has \nprogressed in severity. It is not always pleuritic, but \nexacerbated most by movement and palpation. She then developed \nworsening dyspnea. At rest she did not have significant dyspnea, \nbut was most pronounced with ambulation. She also has a cough \nthat is non-prodcutive. No recent fevers or chills. Mild \nrhinorrhea. She has several family memebers that live with her \non occasion that are all sick with colds. None have flu-like \nillness that she is aware of.

IP was contacted and recommended that if the \neffusion needed urgent drainage, the patient should go to the \nICU. Since she was hemodynamically stable and breathing on room \nair, she was admitted to the floor for management and drainage \nof the effusion. She also had an abdominal CT for abdomainl pain \nand constipation. This did not show any acute abdominal process. \nInitial labs were notable for WBC 13.1 (was 13.8 on ___ and \nplatelets 681.

She had\na chest XR which reported a right hilar lesion and that same day\nshe underwent a CTA of the chest which revealed a large\nill-defined right hilar mass 4.8 x 3.2 cm obstructing the right\nupper lobe bronchus with post-obstructive changes in the right\nupper lobe.  The right hilar mass also narrowed the right main\nbronchus and bronchus intermedius and encompasses the azygous\nvein and abuts the posterior margin of the SVC. It is contiguous\nwith a 3.7 x 2.7 cm necrotic subcarinal soft tissue mass and \nalso\nintimately associated with the esophagus.  Scattered small\npulmonary nodules were noted including an enhancing right upper\nlobe nodule 11mm which may invade the mediastinum.  \n- ___: EBUS and bronchoscopy which showed an endobronchial \nlesion\nin the right maintem bronchus at approximately 0.5-1cm from main\ncarina extending into the bronchus intermedius. The bronchus\nintermedius was narrowed but patent.  FNA of the endobronchial\nlesion (cell block) was consistent poorly differentiated \nnon-small cell lung cancer with immunoreactivity for TTF-1 and \nCK5\/6 (focal), and negative for p63, ER, PR, and GCDFP.   \nCytology from FNA of the right hilar mass was also consistent \nwith non-small cell lung cancer.  7 and 4R station lymph nodes \nwere biopsied and no malignant cells werereported in cytology of \n4R and 7.  \n- ___: PET CT with FDG-avid disease including the right \nhilar\nmass, the right upper lobe 11mm nodule, the subcarinal mass, an\noval structure at the right cardiophrenic angle and a a 18 mm\nleft adrenal lesion.  An MR of the head from the same revealed a\nnew enhancing lesion compared to ___ in the left high frontal\nlobe.\n- ___: Cyberknife X1 to single brain metastasis left\nfrontal lobe.\n- ___: She received palliative chemoradiation,\nCarboplatin and Taxol 1 cycle.\n- ___ Start of radiation therapy to the right hilar lung\nmass with weekly Taxol starting ___.
