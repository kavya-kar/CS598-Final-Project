In ___ ED, was noted to have T-wave flattening in \ninferior leads and troponin 0.02 and was chest pain free.  In \nthe ICU he again noted chest pain the morning of ___, and \ntroponins were trended with rise from 0.02-> 0.05-> 0.02 and \ncontinued to rise with peak of 0.___epressions \nnoted in inferior leads and well as in the lateral leads.  \nInitially though to represent demand ischemia and cardiology \nconsulted who recommended ASA, metoprolol, statin and transfuse \nadditional 2 units pRBCs.  Due to recent GI bleed, GI consulted. \nEGD showed no active bleeding and thought that it was acceptable \nto start anticoagulation with heparin gtt as concern for NSTEMI. \n After transfusion patient continued to have rise in troponin \nand persistent EKG changes, and felt patient most likely with \ntrue NSTEMI.  Troponins started to trend downwards and patient \ntransferred to Cardiology service for potential cardiac \ncatheterization. Cardiac catheterization was not persued in the \nsetting of GI bleed. The decision was made to medically manage \nthe patient. Lisinopril was uptitrated and Imdur was started and \nuptitrated. EKGs were serially monitored through the admission \nwith his T-wave inversions improving during this admission, but \npersistent in I, aVL, V4-V6 as well as II, aVF. Patient will \nneed to follow-up with a Cardiologist as an outpatient, which \nhis wife will arrange (verbally confirmed on the phone) and make \nthe rehab facility aware of this appointment.  \n\n# NSAID-induced upper GI bleed: Patient initially presented from \nrehab to OSH with dark stools x 1 day and found to have Hct of \n21 and transfused 2units pRBCs.  In ___ ED, Hct 25.4, started \non PPI drip.  He was admitted to the MICU for EGD.  GI performed \na an EGD on ___ which showed gastritis, likely NSAID induced as \npatient had been taking large doses of NSAIDs for pain in BKA \nleg. H\/H was trended and was stable.  No more reported melena \novernight.  He was advanced to regular diet which he tolerated \nwell.  GI plans to repeat EGD in 2 months to assess for healing. \nPatient noted to have brown, guaiac positive stools on the \nCardiology Floor. The patient had one HCT drop 24.4 for which he \nreceived 1 unit pRBCs. The patient's hematocrit responded \nappropriately. HCT on day of discharge and day prior to \ndischarge remained stable at ___.\n\n# Phantom Limb Pain secondary to right BKA: Patient with \nsignificant phantom limb pain and had been taking high doses of \nNSAIDs at rehab for this.  While admitted, he was requiring \nfrequent narcotics.  Acute pain service consulted and \nrecommended cymbalta, gabapentin, oxycodone for pain and patient \nhad good improvement in pain.  Physical therapy was consulted, \nand patient will need to continue working with ___ while in \nrehab. \n\n# Delerium: Resoloved. Likely multifactorial including narcotics \nfor phantom limb pain, recent GIB and being in the ICU.\n\n# Severe Peripheral vascular disease: Vascular followed patient \nthrough admission. Continued aspirin. Discontinued Plavix in \nlight of GI bleed. Patient's staples were removed from the ___ \nsite during this admission. Patient will need to continue to \nfollow-up with vascular surgery at ___ upon discharge from \nthis hospitalization. \n\n# Hypertension: Patient restarted on metoprolol, which was then \nchanged to carvedilol for better BP control. Patient's \nlisinopril was also uptitrated to 40mg. Imdur was started and \nuptitrated. \n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES: \n\n#NSTEMI: Patient will need follow-up with an outpatient \nCardiologist, which patient does not have.

The \nestimated right atrial pressure is at least 15 mmHg. Left \nventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular \ncavity is moderately dilated. There is mild regional left \nventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the basal \ninferior wall with mild global hypokinesis. There is \nconsiderable beat-to-beat variability of the left ventricular \nejection fraction due to an irregular rhythm\/premature beats \n(LVEF = 40-50%). The estimated cardiac index is normal \n(>=2.5L\/min\/m2). Doppler parameters are indeterminate for left \nventricular diastolic function.

EKG was normal and patient was \nmonitored on telemetry with occasional PVCs but major events.  \nTTE was largely unchanged and showed no outflow obstruction.  \nOutpatient ___ of hearts showed no events, and he will continue \nto wear this when he returns home.  He has follow-up scheduled \nwith cardiology.\n\n# Craniofacial trauma:  CT scan showed multiple facial \nfractures, including bilateral Lefort I fractures and a \ncomminuted fracture of the nasal bone.  Patient declined \nsurgical intervention so these were managed conservatively.  He \ndid require bilateral nasal packing for bleeding, but these \npackings were removed quickly without any recurrent bleeding.  \nHe was put on clindamycin while packing was in place.  A bedside \nspeech and swallow evaluation was normal, though it was \nrecommended that he have an outpatient video swallow study to \nevaluate for silent aspiration (given RLL opacities on previous \nCXRs).\n\n# Multiple myeloma:  Diagnosed in ___, on cycle 3 of \ncarfilzomib\/pomalidomide.  Neupogen was continued while he was \nhere.  He required one platelet transfusion in the setting of \nbleeding and two blood transfusions.  Acyclovir and allopurinol \nwere continued.\n\nChronic Issues:\n\n# CAD:  MI ___ s\/p PCI to RCA at ___ in ___. \n Catheterization at ___ performed in ___ for 8 month h\/o \nDOE and abnormal persantine MIBI showed proximal occlusion of \nthe RCA, not amenable to PCI; left to right collaterals to the \ndistal RCA were noted.

Right heart catheterization reveled normal \nright and left sided filling pressures, and endomyocardial \nbiopsy with no evidence of amyloid.  Repeat TTE on this \nadmission showed EF 40-50%.  He was continued on metoprolol and \nlisinopril.  There was no evidence of volume overload.   \n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\n=====================\n[ ] Patient was cleared by speech and swallow after bedside \nswallowing evaluation, however they recommended outpatient video \nswallow study to rule out silent aspiration.

He was found to have new RLL \nconsolidation, treated for HAP with Vanc (___) and \n___ with plan to complete 7 day course of cefepime. He \nwas found to have ___, with peak Cr 2.3 on ___ ___ 1.5-1.9) \nwhich improved somewhat with diuresis. Renal ultrasound showed \nno obstruction. Cath was not initially performed due to likely \ntype II NSTEMI, ___ with transplanted kidney, and was eventually \nperformed on ___ with ___ 2 to RCA, with plan for repeat cath \nand LAD in future given ___ and renal transplant. His renal \nfunction and volume status remained stable with holding diuresis \nafter cath, and he was discharged with plan for repeat cath on \n___, and renal, cardiology, and orthopedic follow up.\n\nACUTE ISSUES:  \n=============  \n#NSTEMI\n#Diastolic HF exacerbation\nAfter ORIF, he seemed to recovering well with a course \ncomplicated only by ___ (Cr increased to ~2 from baseline of \n~1.2). On ___, he developed nausea in the morning and gradually \nbecame dyspneic with a new cough over the course of the day. In \nthe evening, he developed dull, left-sided chest pain and \nvomiting and was felt to be diaphoretic. An ECG revealed new \ninferolateral ST depressions and his cTnT was 0.13. Cardiology \nwas consulted for NSTEMI. He was started on ASA and a heparin \ndrip, but cardiology consult service did not feel a LHC was \nwarranted given likely type II STEMI at the time, as well as ___ \non transplanted kidney. His respiratory distress gradually \nincreased through the AM on ___, and he was started on BiPAP. A \nTTE on ___ showed new LAD-territory wall motion abnormalities. \nHe was started on vanc\/cefepime\/azithromycin out of concern for \npneumonia, and ID was consulted given his renal transplant \nhistory. He received IV Lasix boluses up to 200mg and sublingual \nnitroglycerine x2. He was found to have ___, with peak Cr 2.3 on \n___ ___ 1.5-1.9) which improved somewhat with diuresis. He was \nweaned off bipap ___ and transferred to the floor. On the floor \nhe was started on an IV lasix drip and his dyspnea and oxygen \nrequirements gradually improved. Given improving renal function, \nhe underwent coronary angiography where two DES were placed in \nthe RCA with plan for interval stenting of LAD lesion in two \nweeks time. He was euvolemic at time of discharge with stable \nrenal function for two days off of diuretics, and was therefore \ndischarged off of diuretics. If weight gain, hypoxemia, lower \nextremity edema, consider IV diuresis (has required 200mg IV \nLasix and gtt at 20\/hr). Continue ASA, Plavix, rosuvastatin, and \nmetoprolol.\n\n___ on CKD s\/p renal transplant:\nInitially, the patient had increased Cr in the setting of volume \noverlaod and poor systolic cardiac function making a cardiorenal \nsyndrome a likely cause. He subsequently had aggressive diuresis \nwith improvement in Cr. (baseline Cr is 1.2-1.4). He \nsubsequently had rising Cr post-cath suggesting some contrast \nnephropathy. His Cr stabilized at 2.0 on discharge. Transplant \nnephrology followed while inpatient and tacro dosing was kept \nthe same per their recommendations. He will need renal \ntransplant follow up within 6 weeks. He should have chem-7 \nre-checked either daily, or at least by ___. His next \ntacro level should be checked ___ am 12 hours after last dose.\n\n#Anemia: \nHct ~23 from baseline of 30 following L tibial ORIF.

Now improving with Hgb >8.\n\n#Leukocytosis:\n#PNA:\nPatient developed WBC to 12.5 on ___. Given the correlation with \nthe development of his NSTEMI symptoms, it is likely that this \nrepresents a non-specific inflammatory response to infarction. \nHe had concomitant development of a cough and hypoxemia which \nraised the possibility of PNA, though his chest X-ray showed no \nfocal consolidations. ID was consulted given his history of \nrenal transplant will continue cefepime. Blood cultures were \nnegative and he completed a course with Cefepime (___). The \npatients WBC count remained wnl and he remained without fevers \nfor the remainder of his hospitalization.\n\n#DM1: \nComplicated by diabetic retinopathy, ulcers. ___ was \nconsulted and discharge regimen as attached.\n\n#S\/p renal transplant: \nDCD kidney in ___. Patient is on immunosuppression regimen per \ntransplant nephrology of mycophenalate, prednisone (5 mg) daily \nand tacrolimus 2 mg PO BID with goal tacrolimus level of ___. \nTroughs to be drawn 12 hours after ___ dose.

This was likely exacerbated by his recent alcohol use \n(serum tox level was 51 on admission)and he was possibly \nsomewhat volume depleted given his ketonuria. Initial physical \nexam showed diaphoresis, tremulousness, and cerebellar signs \nconsistent with alcohol intoxication\/early withdrawal. ___ in ED \nwas WNL, so hypoglycemia was unlikely contributing factor. Had a \nsimilar, but less severe episode ont he commuter rail 2 weeks \nago, also after a weekend of drinking EtOH. His episode did not \noccur after rising to standing position so unlikely to be \northostatic syncope. Cardiogenic syncope (arrhythmia, \nhypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy) was considered less \nlikely given that he did not lose consiousness suddenly and did \nnot have a true LOC. He underwent an ECG which showed normal \nsinus rhythm with left axis deviation as well as left \nventricular hypertrophy and was placed on telemetry which \ndemonstrated no electrical abnormalities. There was no evidence \non history or physical exam to suggest seizure or TIA as cause.  \n\n.\n#EtOH Abuse\/Tobacco use: Patient reported drinking ___ cups of \nvodka daily for the past ___s having recent \nalcohol use with serum tox positive for alcohol on admission. \nTherefore, there was concern for withdrawal and he was placed on \na CIWA scale, although did not require any diazepam and \nmanifested only mild tremulousness. He was started on folic acid \n1 mg QD and thiamine 100 mg QD daily and will be discharged on \nthese as well. He was also placed on a nicotine patch given his \nsignificant tobacco use and supplied with prescriptions for \nnicotine patch and gum. \n.\n#Gait disturbance: Patient describes feeling unsteady on his \nfeet, particularly in shower and when he closes his eyes that \nhas developed slowly over past year. His neuro exam was notable \nfor proprioceptive loss in b\/l toes, and wide-based gait with \nshort steps, with an inability to tandem walk which was \nconsistent with a sensory ataxia (disturbance of the dorsal \ncolumns or of peripheral nerves). This was thought to be \nsecondary to a direct toxic alcoholic peripheral neuropathy \ncomplicated by concurrent nutritional deficiencies, although \nvitamin B12 level was normal. He was started on thiamine and \ninformed that his alcohol use was the likely cause. \n.\n#Hypertension: Patient was found to be hypertensive (max \n177\/100) while in house and was started on chlorthalidone prior \nto discharge. He will need follow-up with PCP in next few days \nto address his blood pressure response. \n.\nINACTIVE ISSUES:\n.\n#Depression: Patient stated that he has felt depressed over the \npast year, especially since the loss of his girlfriend ___ year \nago. He expressed interest in mental health services and social \nwork was consulted. \n.\n#Tongue polyps: Incidentally found over ___ years ago and have \nnot been a significant issue and been stable in size. However \ngiven his significant alcohol\/tobacco history, his risk of \ntongue cancer is increased. THere was no friable tissue on exam \nand no associated lymphadenopathy. Follow-up of polyps by PCP is \n___. \n.\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\n1. EtOH abuse: Patient drinking large amounts of alcohol daily \nand would benefit from supportive groups like AA, and continual \ncounseling on the harmful effects of alcohol as an outpatient.\n2. Hypertension: Patient started on chlorthalidone while in \nhospital. Blood pressure response\/screening for side effects as \noutpatient is needed.\n3. Depression: Patient admitted to feelings of sadness over the \npast year and was interested in speaking with outpatient \npsychiatrist. Should monitor symptoms of depression, consider \ntreatment with SSRI\/psychotherapy on an outpatient basis. \nPatient has had an extensive discussion with a social worker, \nwho recommended grief counceling as outpatient. \n4. Tongue Polyps: Patient found to have two <1cm polyps on left \nlateral aspect of tongue. Should monitor growth\/changes as an \noutpatient. \n5. Peripheral Neuropathy: most likely related to chronic ETOH \nabuse though pt was referred to neurology for outpt follow up \nand additional work up.\n\n \nMedications on Admission:\nNo presciption drugs\nOTC:\n- 2 ___ aspirin daily\n- Fish oil\n- mulitvitamin\n\n \nDischarge Medications:\n1. nicotine (polacrilex) 2 mg Gum Sig: One (1) Gum Buccal Q1H \n(every hour) as needed for craving.\nDisp:*90 Gum(s)* Refills:*0*\n2. nicotine 7 mg\/24 hr Patch 24 hr Sig: One (1)  Transdermal \nonce a day.\nDisp:*30 patches* Refills:*0*\n3. thiamine HCl 100 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY \n(Daily).\nDisp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*\n4. folic acid 1 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).\nDisp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*\n5. chlorthalidone 25 mg Tablet Sig: ___ Tablet PO once a day: \nplease take ___ tablet a day.\nDisp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*\n\n \nDischarge Disposition:\nHome\n \nDischarge Diagnosis:\nPrimary diagnosis: Presyncope\nSecondary diagnosis: Hypertension, Alcohol Abuse, Peripheral \nNeuropathy\n\n \nDischarge Condition:\nMental Status: Clear and coherent.\nLevel of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.\nActivity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.","summary":"You were admitted to ___ on ___ due to an episode of lightheadness and near fainting. You were worked up for possible causes of this episode including heart problems, problems with your blood, kidneys, or nerve problems. You underwent an electrocardiogram, which measures the electrical activity of the heart. This showed that part of your heart, the left ventricle, is enlarged (the wall is thicker), but did not show any abnormal rhythms or reasons to believe your episode was due to your heart. You also had a chest x ray which showed that the heart and lungs were normal. You were also found to have high blood pressure, which explains why the left side of your heart is larger (it must pump against a higher pressure)."}

The right atrium \nis markedly dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular \nhypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional\/global systolic \nfunction (LVEF=55%). The right ventricular free wall is \nhypertrophied. The right ventricular cavity is moderately \ndilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. There is \nabnormal septal motion\/position consistent with right \nventricular pressure\/volume overload. The aortic valve leaflets \n(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and \nno aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve \nleaflets are structurally normal. No mitral regurgitation is \nseen. The tricuspid valve leaflets fail to fully coapt. Severe \n[4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is severe pulmonary \nartery systolic hypertension. [In the setting of at least \nmoderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, the estimated \npulmonary artery systolic pressure may be underestimated due to \na very high right atrial pressure.] The main pulmonary artery is \ndilated. There is a small pericardial effusion. There are no \nechocardiographic signs of tamponade. \n\nIMPRESSION: Moderately dilated right ventricular cavity with \nmoderate global free wall hypokinesis and pressure\/volume \noverload. Severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Small \npericardial effusion with no echocardiographic signs of \ntamponade. \n\nCompared to the study on ___, the right ventricle is more \ndilated and hypokinetic with pronounced pressure\/volume \noverload. The degree of pulmonary artery systolic hypertension \nand tricuspid regurgitation had signicantly worsened. A \npericardial effusion is now present. Global left ventricular \nsystolic function is slighly lower due to interventricular \ninteraction.\n\n___ (___): No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in either leg.\n\nAbdominal US (___): No ascites.\n\nKUB (___): Nonspecific bowel gas pattern with no evidence of \nobstruction or ileus.\n\nCTA chest (___): Massive pulmonary embolism with embolism burden \ngreater on the right than the left with evidence of right heart \nstrain.

Denied any excessive NSAID or ETOH use, H\/H 7.6\/22.1 on\nadmission, transfused 2 units PRBC.  LFTs also found to be to\nelevated (AST 158, ALT 230, AP 311, TB 1.9).  Viral hepatatis,\nautoimmune hepatitis, and PBC serologies negative.  EGD was\nperformed which revealed Barrett's esophagitis and probable\nportal gastropathy without active bleeding.  U\/S that day\ndemonstrated ascites of unclear etiology, borderline fatty \nliver,\nand extrahepatic biliary dilatation. Course complicated by\nStreptococcus bacteremia from presumed SBP and was started on\nLevaquin and Vanco, TTE negative for endocarditis.  \n- ___ CT abdomen showed liver disease with ascites,\nmesenteric varices, recanalization of the umbilical vein,\nprominence of the spleen, cavernous transformation of the main\nPV. There is intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation. The CBD is\nnot seen well in the region of the expected location of the main\nPV and therefore narrowing cannot be excluded. \n- ___ MRI showed a 5 cm hypoenhancing mass in the region of\nthe pancreatic neck and proximal body as well as a 2.4 cm \nhepatic\nmass. Evidence of portal vein involvement by the mass, with\nassociated obstruction and resultant upper abdominal varices.\nNarrowing of the distal intrapancreatic common duct by the\npancreatic lesion and intra- and extra-hepatic biliary ductal\ndilatation. Small amount of ascites. \n- ___ Chest CT showed no metastatic disease.  Possibility \nof\nleft parathyroid adenoma versus mild lymphadenopathy.  \n- ___ EUS here at ___ showed a 5.5 cm X 4 cm ill-defined\nmass in the neck of the pancreas with irregular and poorly\ndefined borders. The mass was hypoechoic and heterogenous in\nechotexture. There was an irregular plane between the mass and\nnormal appearing pancreatic parenchyma with normal size PD. It\nwas not clear if the mass was originating from the pancreas or\nabutting adjacent pancreatic tissue.  FNA was performed. A\n___ lymph node was noted, measuring 5 mm in diameter\nwith well-defined borders. There was a caliber change of the PV\nwhich was encased by the pancreatic mass. A 3 cm X 2 cm\nwell-defined mass was noted in the right hepatic lobe with\nregular and well-defined borders.  FNA was performed of the\nmasses in the pancreas and liver. Both the liver and pancreatic\nlesions were POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS, consistent with\npancreatic endocrine tumor. Tumor cells are positive for\ncytokeratin cocktail, chromogranin and synaptophysin, but\nnegative for beta-catenin. Mib-1 stains only rare cells. No\nmitoses are seen. The findings suggest a low-grade tumor.\n- ___ Octreotide scan showed multiple liver mets and an \navid\npancreatic head mass\n- ___ Start CK therapy\n- ___ Completed 3 session of CK with 24 Gy to the \npancreatic\nmass and 3 liver mets\n- ___ CT torso showed a large heterogeneous mass at the \nroot\nof the mesentery, with extension into the lesser sac, overall\nunchanged in size but with increased encasement\/obliteration of\nthe celiac axis as it courses through the ___ the mass. \nIncreased hypodensity adjacent to the fiducial seeds could\nrepresent tumor necrosis\/response to therapy. \n- ___ CT torso showed multiple arterially-hyperenhancing\nhepatic lesions throughout the right and left hepatic lobes\nmeasuring up to 2.7 cm, consistent with neuroendocrine\nmetastases, are new to increased in size in the interval.\nInterval stability of heterogeneous, predominantly\narterially-hyperenhancing 5.5 x 4.1 x 4.4 cm known \nneuroendocrine\ntumor. Unchanged obliteration of the celiac trunk.  Patent \ndistal\nhepatic arteries likely due to reconstitution from collateral\nvessels. Interval development of occlusion of the main portal\nvein extending to the origins of the intrahepatic portal \nbranches\nwith occlusion of the proximal left portal vein but distal\nreconstitution of both right and left intrahepatic portal\nbranches. Occlusion of the splenic vein, with new splenomegaly. \n- ___ MR liver showed a dominant mass centered in the\npancreatic head representing the primary neuroendocrine tumor\ninvading the portal confluence, with resultant thrombosis of the\nmain portal vein, and complete invasion of the celiac axis. \nOverall, the mass is marginally smaller compared to baseline CT\nexamination from ___ but similar compared to basedline MRI\nfrom ___.

Nutrition consulted during admission recommended \nsupplemental ensures three times a day. \n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES\n=================================================\n1. Pt was discharged on ciprofloxacin for SBP prophylaxis, which \nshe will need to continue indefinitely. If she has recurrent \nSBP, could consider transitioning to cefpodoxime, as she had \nciprofloxacin-resistant UTI during admission. \n2. Pt had suspected variceal bleed during admission. First EGD \nshowed 4 codes of grade III varices with stigmata of recent \nbleeding. The pt had no further bleeding while inpatient. Repeat \nEGD 5 days later only showed 1 cord of grade II varices so she \ndid not have any banding done\n3. Pt was discharge on home Lasix and increased spironolactone. \nShe reports being 20lb up from dry weight on discharge. She \nneeds close monitoring of her volume status and diuretic \nadjustments accordingly. ___ also need therapeutic paracentesis\n4. Please get electrolytes in follow up 1 week from discharge \n(Did not require repletions while inpatient) \n5. Pt needs to continue rifaximin and lactulose (titrate to ___ \nBMs\/day) to prevent recurrence of hepatic encephalopathy.\n6. Patient's Apixaban was discontinued in setting of variceal \nbleed, and was not restarted on discharge due to risk of \nbleeding. Consider restarting a reversible anticoagulant if \nappropriate in follow up\n7. Nadolol was discontinued because it can increase mortality in \npatients with cirrhosis with a history of SBP. \n8. Patient declined home ___. She would benefit from daily \nmonitoring of weight and volume status. Also for medication \nadherence and monitoring for hepatic encephalopathy.

Hyperexpansion of the lungs with some coarseness \nof interstitial markings raises the possibility of chronic \npulmonary disease.  No acute focal pneumonia.\n\n=====================\nMICROBIOLOGY\n=====================\nNone.\n\n \n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nMr. ___ is a ___ year old male with past medical history \nsignificant for HFpEF, afib on warfarin, and HTN who presented \nto an outside hospital after a brief presyncopal episode, and \nwas found to be in afib with RVR to 160s requiring esmolol gtt, \nnow s\/p ablation and PPM on ___. Hospital course complicated \nby new HFrEF with EF of 20%.\n\n# Acute on Chronic HF: Patient with a previously preserved EF, \nhowever now found to have a newly depressed LVEF of 20% with \naortic stenosis. For preload reduction he was diuresed with \nLasix as appropriate. For afterload reduction, he was started on \nLisinopril 5mg daily. For contractility, he underwent ablation \nand ICD placement as above. His metoprolol succinate was held \nbut reinstated after the procedure. His home digoxin was held \nwhile admitted. On discharge patient was clinically euvolemic on \nexam. His discharge weight was 102.8 kg (226.6 punds) His acute \non chronic HF likely secondary to tachyarrhythmia although \netiology remains unclear. Tachycardia controlled, unlikely \nischemia mediated. Recommend repeat ECHO in ___ months after \noptimal medical therapy and control of tachyarrhythmia. For his \npreload he was discharged on Lasix 30mg IV daily, and \nspironolactone 12.5mg daily. For his afterload he was discharged \non lisinopril 5mg, and for his contractility his home metoprolol \nwas changed to Metoprolol Succinate XL 75 mg PO DAILY. His home \ndigoxin was held this hospitalization.\n\n# Permanent atrial fibrillation with RVR s\/p AVJ ablation and \nPPM on ___: Unclear duration of afib with RVR or \nprecipitant. His Afib was difficult to control throughout his \nhospital course. He was initially trialed on several rate \ncontrolling drugs, including Diltiazem, Amiodarone, and \nVerapamil. His heart rate was not able to be controlled with \nthese. A basic infectious work-up was unremarkable; he did not \nhave an elevated WBC count during admission. His TSH and LFTs \nwere checked and were normal. He underwent and AV node ablation \nand pacemaker placement on ___. On telemetry he had \noccasional episodes of NSVT with ___ beats that was \nasymptomatic. His home diltiazem, digoxin, and metoprolol were \nheld. After his ablation and pacemaker placement he was started \non metoprolol succinate XL and discharged on a dose of 75mg \ndaily. His home warfarin schedule is 5 mg x 5d, 2.5 mg MF. He \nwas found to have a supratherapeutic INR to 4.8 on ___ (goal \nINR 2.0-3.0) and his dose was reduced to 2.5mg daily. This was \ncontinued during his hospitalization. On ___ he received an \nincreased dose of 5mg for an INR of 2.1, and then was dropped \nback to a dose of 2.5mg daily. His INR was 2.4 on discharge. \nRecommend recheck of INR in ___ days after discharge. He should \nfollow up with Dr. ___ at ___ regarding his INR and \nwarfarin dose adjustments.\n   \n#Urinary retention | BPH: During hospitalization, he \noccasionally was noted to have poor urine output. Bladder scan \nshowed 685 cc in the bladder, he was subsequently straight \ncath'd. This was somewhat difficult and produced moderate \nhematuria due to traumatic catheterization. It was felt that the \nurinary retention was likely secondary to his known BPH. He was \nmaintained on his home dose of finasteride, and started on \nTamsulosin 0.4mg daily. His foley was removed on ___. Upon \ndischarge he was able to urinate independently with no retained \nurine.\n\n#Mild ___. Creatinine increased to as high as 1.4 This was felt \nto be due to his urinary retention. His creatinine improved to \n1.0 upon discharge.\n\n#Hypertension. Controlled with Metoprolol and Diltiazem as \nabove.\n\n#Hyperlipidemia. He was continued on his home statin.\n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES\n==================\n- Discharge weight: 102.8\n- Discharge diuretic regimen: Furosemide 20 mg PO\/NG DAILY, \nspironolactone 12.5mg daily\n- Pacemaker placed ___. Patient will need to be seen in \ndevice clinic for follow up in 1 week.\n- Recommend repeat ECHO in ___ months after optimal medical \ntherapy and control of tachyarrhythmia.\n- Recommend close follow up of aortic stenosis to see if EF \nrecovers. Please follow up on aortic valve area in a few months.\n- He should be evaluated for obstructive sleep apnea as an \noutpatient. He was observed to have several apneic episodes \novernight while admitted.\n- Foley catheter removed on ___, please monitor for urinary \nretention. Patient was sent home on his home finasteride, and \nstarted on tamsulosin in the hospital to help with his urinary \nretention. Upon discharge he was able to urinate independently \nwith no retained urine.\n- Warfarin dose changed to 2.5mg daily given supratherapeutic \nINR on admission. INR 2.4 on day of discharge. He was discharged \nhome on 2.5mg warfarin daily.

The CTA was \nnegative for PE or pneumonia. The thought was that the patient \nmost likely had an acute COPD exacerbation. He was treated with \nsteroids, inhalers and azithromycin. He was extubated and weaned \noff of oxygen the day after admission. He maintained oxygenation \nand was breathing without difficulty or wheezes. We will treat \nhim with a short course of steroids (5 days of prednisone total) \nand antibiotics. The antibiotics were changed from azithromycin \nto levofloxacin (due to UTI, see below). Given how rapid he \nimproved, it is likely that another factor caused the lung \nsymptoms. We think this is likely obstructive sleep apnea and \npossible obesity hypoventilation syndrome (see below).\n\n# Obstructive sleep apnea: He should be treated with BiPAP, \nwhich has been ordered by his pulmonologist. It is currently \nunder review for ___. I contacted ___ to attempt \nto expedite the process but was unable to make it happen. Given \nthat he had two nights where he was asymptomatic and maintained \noxygenation (continuous O2 pleth) I think it is safe to \ndischarge home temporarily without BiPAP. I do recommend that he \nsleeps at least at a ___ degree angle to minimize obstruction.\n\n# Urinary tract infection: The patient had a UA with 23 WBC. He \nhad some urinary symptoms. It is unclear if this is related to \nhis foley catheter or is not actually a urinary tract infection. \nWe will treat him with levofloxacin at the above course.\n\n# Tachycardia: He had tachycardia which was thought to be due to \nalbuterol, deconditioning and dehydration. He was hydrated with \nIV fluids with improvement in his tachycardia. He would have HR \nof 120s with ambulation and 70-80s at rest. He was asymptomatic. \nCTA was negative for PE.\n\n# Schizophrenia: He was continued on his home medications.\n\n# Prior PE: He was treated with coumadin. Due to him being on \nantibiotics his INR levels will need to be monitored closely. He \nshould have his INR checked on ___. His dose was \ndecreased to 3mg per day.\n\n# HTN: He was continued on his home medications.\n\n# Hypothyroid: continued on levothyroxine\n\nFull Code\n\nTransitional issues\n- Monitor INR on ___ (goal INR ___ - needs warfarin \ntitration\n- Needs BiPAP when it is approved by ___\n- follow up with primary care physician and pulmonologist\n\n___ on call doctor ___ Dr. ___ was notified of discharge plan \nverbally.\n \nMedications on Admission:\nAbilify 20 mg Tab Oral 1 Tablet(s) Once Daily \nKlonopin 1 mg Tab Oral 1 Tablet(s) Twice Daily \nRisperdal 2 mg Tab Oral 3 Tablet(s) Once Daily, at bedtime  \nZyprexa 10 mg Tab Oral 1 Tablet(s) Once Daily am  \nZyprexa 10 mg Tab Oral 2 Tablet(s) Once Daily, at bedtime \nAtivan 1 mg Tab Oral 1 Tablet(s) Every 2 hours , as needed  \nOne Daily Multivitamin Tab Oral 1 Tablet(s) Once Daily \nCombivent 18 mcg-103 mcg\/actuation Aerosol Inhaler Inhalation 2 \nAerosol(s) Every ___ hrs, as needed \nCoumadin 5 mg Tab Oral 1 Tablet(s) Once Daily  \nZocor 20 mg Tab Oral 1 Tablet(s) Once Daily, at bedtime  \nNizoral 2 % Shampoo Topical 1 Shampoo(s) Twice a week \nSynthroid 25 mcg Tab Oral 1 Tablet(s) Once Daily \nTylenol ___ mg Tab Oral 2 Tablet(s) Every ___ hrs, as needed \nSenokot To Go 8.6 mg Tab Oral 1 Tablet(s) Twice Daily \nprednisone -- Unknown Strength Unknown sig \nlisinopril 20 mg Tab Oral 1 Tablet(s) Once Daily  \n \nDischarge Medications:\n1. levofloxacin 500 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q24H (every \n24 hours) for 6 days.\nDisp:*6 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*\n2. prednisone 20 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO once a day for \n3 days.\nDisp:*6 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*\n3.

Holter monitor ___\nshowed sinus rhythm with sinus arrhythmia, occasional APBs, one\nrun of SVT. The transient diplopia was felt to be possible\nmigraine variant but given possibility of TIA, she was started \non\nASA. Patient reports she has had several more episodes of\nvertical diplopia since that initial one. The longest was 10\nminute episode about 1 week ago. She woke up at 3AM and noticed\nit. Seemed the same regardless if she looked right or left;\nperhaps worse with her head back. This went away and was not\nassociated with any other symptoms. \n\nHospital Course:\n\nShe was initially admitted to the stroke service, with an \ninitial NIHSS 3 and last known well 2 weeks prior to admission. \nHer exam was notable for right homonymous hemianopia, mild word \nfinding difficulties, and mild right facial droop. Her initial \nMRI showed thin cortical diffusion-weighted hyperintense signal \nalong the left parietooccipital lobe and possible potential \nmilder signal along the right parieto-occipital lobe without \ncorresponding signal abnormality on FLAIR or T2. We felt this \nwas highly atypical for stroke given the lack of FLAIR correlate \nand crossing PCA\/MCA territories. We evaluated for whether she \ncould have an occipital seizure with an EEG. The EEG showed \nfrequent delta slowing over the left temporal region, at times \nsharply contoured, with rare LRDAs. There was also asymmetric \nPDR on the left side indicating occipital dysfunction, and GRDA \nindicating mild encephalopathy, but no clear electrographic \nseizures or epileptiform discharges. Therefore, seizure was felt \nto be extremely unlikely.  We also evaluated and ruled out \ncortical venous thrombosis and PRES (no risk factors). \n\nShe was transferred to the general neurology service for further \nworkup as her presentation was not thought to be vascular in \nnature. We then considered MELAS given her history of idiopathic \nsensorineural hearing loss, and sent metabolic and genetic \ntesting. Her visual symptoms continued to progress during the \nadmission with denser right hemianopia, some left visual field \ninvolvement, and increased word finding difficulties. Repeat MRI \nshowed evolving and slightly worsening findings: \n\"Redemonstration of diffusion-weighted hyperintense signal \ninvolving the\nleft parietooccipital cortex, with associated decreased ASL \nperfusion in the\nleft occipital lobe with similar distribution and extent.  \nInterval\ndevelopment of subtle cortical thickening and FLAIR \nhyperintensity involving\nthe median occipital lobe most likely represents manifestation \nof the\nperfusion abnormality.\" Ultimately, we felt that this would be \nan atypical presentation of MELAS given the lack of resolution \nof her symptoms, her age at presentation, and her normal lactate \n(including post-prandial lactate), CK, and minimally elevated \npyruvate, with other labs pending at discharge. \n\nGiven her imaging findings and predominant visual symptoms, we \nconsidered ___ variant CJD and sent ___ and RT-QuIC \nfrom the CSF, with results pending at discharge. She was also \nevaluated by Neuro-ophthalmology on ___, and her exam showed \nRight homonymous hemianopia without significant neglect in the \nsetting of left parietal\/occipital cortical diffusion \nrestriction sparing the white matter and in a non-vascular \ndistribution, simultanagnosia, and progressive cognitive \ndecline, as well as right hypertropia with full ductions, likely \ndecompensated phoria. \n\nShe was initially started on ASA and Plavix given our first \nconcern for stroke, and she was ultimately discharged on \naspirin. We also started coenzyme Q10 given our concern for a \npossible mitochondrial disorder. \n\nShe was set up with home ___, OT, nursing and social work. She \nwill follow up with neuro-ophthalmology within the next ___ \nweeks. We have referred her to cognitive neurology and brain fit \nclub for cognitive rehab. We also contacted her outpatient \nneurologist Dr. ___ to coordinate follow up. \n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

You were initially admitted to the Stroke service because we were concerned for a stroke, but your symptoms and your MRI did not fit that diagnosis. You were then transferred to the General Neurology team. We did 2 brain MRIs, a spinal tap, an EEG, CTs, an echocardiogram, and multiple lab tests. These tests evaluated for stroke, seizure, infection, metabolic or genetic causes, and dementia. We are still waiting for many of the results from our lab testing. You were also evaluated by our Neuro-ophthalmology colleagues. At this time, we do not have a definitive diagnosis for your symptoms, and we need more information from the lab tests that are still pending. Once we have these test results back, we can come up with a plan for further workup if needed. We added co-enzyme Q10 to your medication list.

Urine studies \nwith high osmolality, high sodium suggestive of SIADH. TSH \nnormal. Initial urine studies complicated by HCTZ use prior to \nadmission but repeat studies again consistent with SIADH. \nPatient's sodium improved moderately with 1L fluid restriction \nthough did not return to normal and salt tabs were added. With \nTID salt tabs, sodium improved to 133 on discharge. Etiology of \nSIADH thought to be most likely pain given ongoing poorly \ncontrolled back pain over last several months. Unlikely to be \nrelated to head injury given degree of hyponatremia on admission \nand lack of evidence of intracranial bleeding on head CT scan. \nPatient discharged on 1L fluid restriction with TID salt tabs. \n\n# Leukopenia: New leukopenia starting ___ with normal \ndifferential and without neutropenia. Acute drop in leukocytes \nmost consistent with medication effect, less likely to be \nmalignancy given acuity of change. Pantoprazole was stopped as \nthis can cause marrow suppression. Patient's only new medication \non admission was augmentin which does not typically cause \nleukopenia. Leukocytes trending up on discharge. If they do not \nnormalize, patient would benefit from outpatient heme\/onc \nconsult. \n\n# Multiple non-displaced facial fractures s\/p mechanical fall: \nFall sounded mechanical as patient did not lose conciousness, \nhad no prodrome and remembers fall occuring. Fall may also have \nbeen partially related to narcotic use and hyponatremia. \nNon-displaced fractures of maxillary sinuses, right orbital \nfloor. Seen by plastics and ACS who did not feel patient needed \noperative management of fractures. Also seen by opthamology who \nconfirmed normal opthomalogic exam and no need for further \nopthamologic ___. Patient place on sinus precautions \n(described in discharge instructions) and completed 5 day course \nof Augmentin for sinus prophylaxis. Patient did not have \nsignificant facial pain throughout admission. Bruising and \nabrasions healing well on discharge. Patient to ___ with \nPlastic surgery 2 weeks after fall. Seen by ___ who cleared \npatient for ambulation with walker. Patient moving in with \ndaughter-in-law at discharge to help prevent falls in the \nfuture. \n\n# Back Pain: Patient with chronic pain from reported \ndegenerative discs in lumbar spine. Patient with acute onset of \npain in ___. She has been on several medications in the past \nincluding lyrica, vicodin, lidocaine patches to treat her pain. \nShe was continued on oxycodone and standing tylenol during her \nadmission. Pain service was contacted who recommended gabapentin \nor flexeril for pain control but given that these are also \nsedating and place patient at risk of falls, pain regimen of \noxycodone\/tylenol and lidocaine patch was continued with plan \nfor pain clinic ___ to discuss non-sedating treatments for \ndegenerative disc disease in this ___ year old female with recent \nfalls. \n \n# Hypertension: Patient with diagnosis of hypertension, was \ntaking HCTZ-triamterine at home. Blood pressure moderately well \ncontrolled throughout admission off of anti-hypertensives. If \nneed to treat hypertension in future, would favor ACE-I or \ntorsemide given risk of worsening hyponatremia with HCTZ. \n\n# Anemia: Stable. Apparently patient has had iron deficiency \nanemia in past though no evidence of this on our labs (per MCV, \nRDW). Patient did not show any evidence of bleeding in setting \nof multiple head injuries with fall. Hematocrit stable during \nadmission. Patient was continued on home iron supplementation \nduring admission.\n\n# Constipation: Having daily bowel movements at discharge. Will \nneed to continue aggressive bowel regimen on discharge to \nprevent constipation in setting of ongoing narcotic pain med \nrequirements.    \n \n# FEN: regular diet with 1L fluid restriction and TID salt tabs \nfor hyponatremia treatment.\n------------\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\n-Needs repeat sodium and CBC drawn within one week of discharge \n(should be drawn at PCP ___ ___\n-If persistent hyponatremia or hypertension while off hctz, can \ntry 5mg torsemide daily which can disrupt countercurrent \nmechanism and help treat hyponatremia associated with SIADH.\n-Pain control with narcotics for last several months now with \nmultiple falls.

Some \nconcern for pulmonary infarction, but concern is low given the \nmildness of his symptoms. Admission labs were remarkable for INR \nof 7.5. For this, Coumadin was held on ___. INR was 2.7 on \n___. Per discussion with PCP, INR had been close to therapeutic \nfrom ___. In light of this, the INR on admission labs was \nmost likely spurious. Coumadin was restarted at 3 mg daily on \n___. On ___, INR was 1.8. Given goal INR of ___ and grave \nconsequences of recurrent VTE, patient started on Lovenox bridge \nwhich he received teaching for while in hospital. He should \ncontinue on Lovenox until he has been therapeutic on Coumadin \nfor 48 hours, which will most likely be early next week. \nDiscussed this with PCP. Patient instructed to go to PCP's \noffice tomorrow for an INR check. \n\nCHRONIC ISSUES\n\n# Right ventricular failure: TTE from ___ with RV hypokinesis, \nsevere TR, and pulmonary hypertension.

The ventricles and sulci are mildly \nprominent, suggesting mild age-related volume loss. The basal \ncisterns are patent. Minimal periventricular confluent \nhypodensities are stable and consistent with chronic small \nvessel ischemic disease. A small intraparenchymal calcification \nadjacent to the left lateral ventricle is unchanged from prior \nstudies. This is of unclear etiology, but given its stability, \nthis is likely benign. No fracture is identified. The visualized \nparanasal sinuses, mastoid air cells, and middle ear cavities \nare clear. \nIMPRESSION: \n1. No acute intracranial process. \n2. Stable mild age-related volume loss and mild chronic small \nvessel ischemic \ndisease. \n\nChest X-Ray\nFINDINGS: The lung volumes are low. There is interstitial \nprominence consistent with mild pulmonary edema. No pleural \neffusion is present. The cardiac silhouette is moderately \nenlarged. There is no consolidation or \npneumothorax.   \nIMPRESSION: \n1. Mild pulmonary edema. \n2. Moderate cardiomegaly. \n\nECHO\nFindings  \nThis study was compared to the report of the prior study (images \nnot available) of ___.  \nLEFT ATRIUM: Mild ___. \n.\nRIGHT ATRIUM\/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Moderately dilated RA. \n.\nLEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Normal LV cavity size. \nOverall normal LVEF (>55%). TDI E\/e' < 8, suggesting normal PCWP \n(<12mmHg). No resting LVOT gradient. \n.\nRIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size. TASPE depressed \n(<1.6cm) \n.\nAORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal \nascending aorta diameter. Normal aortic arch diameter. \n.\nAORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). \n.\nMITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets with trivial MR. \n.\nTRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial \nTR. Borderline PA systolic hypertension. \n.\nPULMONIC VALVE\/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflet. \nNo PS.

Left ventricular wall thicknesses are \nnormal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left \nventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Tissue \nDoppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling \npressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size is \nnormal. Tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion is depressed \n(1.5 cm) consistent with borderline\/mild right ventricular \nsystolic dysfunction. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly \nthickened. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with \ntrivial mitral regurgitation. There is borderline pulmonary \nartery systolic hypertension. There is a trivial\/physiologic \npericardial effusion. \nCompared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable \nfor review) of ___, findings are similar.  \n.\nVideo Oropharyngeal Swallow Study\nSWALLOWING VIDEO FLUROSCOPY: Oropharyngeal swallowing video \nfluoroscopy was performed in conjunction with the speech and \nswallow division. Multiple consistencies of barium were \nadministered. Barium passed freely through the oropharynx \nwithout evidence of obstruction. There was silent aspiration \nwith thin and nectar-thick liquids. Delayed initiation of oral \nphase of swallowing was observed. There was also mild \noropharyngeal residue during the exam. \nIMPRESSION: Aspiraiton with thin and nectar-thick liquids. For \ndetails, \nplease refer to speech and swallow note in OMR. \n.\nDischarge Labs:\n___ 05:28AM BLOOD WBC-5.6 RBC-4.50* Hgb-13.5* Hct-42.4 \nMCV-94 MCH-30.0 MCHC-31.8 RDW-13.2 Plt ___\n___ 05:28AM BLOOD Glucose-58* UreaN-20 Creat-1.0 Na-141 \nK-4.4 Cl-103 HCO3-32 AnGap-10\n___ 05:28AM BLOOD Calcium-9.6 Phos-4.2 Mg-2.0\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nMr. ___ is a ___ y\/o male with a history of poorly controlled \nDM, HTN, recent frontotemporal dementia\/ALS, who presented with \nsyncope and coughs with eating.\n\n#  Syncope:  The patient presented to the hospital after a \nwitnessed episode of syncope.  The differential diagnosis for \nsyncope includes cardiac (arrhythmia, structural heart disease, \nacute MI), vasovagal, orthostasis, or neurological conditions \n(seizures, CVA), and metabolic causes (hypoglycemia).  Given the \nclinical picture, concern for seizure was low.  Chest xray \nrevealed mild pulmonary edema and moderate cardiomegaly; \ntherefore, an echocardiogram was obtained which basically showed \nno significant change from prior exam.  Head CT was negative for \nan acute intracranial process.  It was decided that the patient \nshould be admitted to the hospital for overnight monitoring.  \nThe patient was placed on cardiac telemetry and no abnormalities \nwere noted.  In addition, EKG and two sets of troponins ruled \nout an acute MI.  Since the patient has poorly controlled IDDM, \nBPH treated with tamsulosin, had come out of a shower prior to \nthe syncope, seemed clammy and progressively became \nunresponsive, it is most likely that he had orthostasis or \nvasovagal episode.  He also may have been hypoglycemic at the \ntime as he did not have anything to eat for a while after \ngetting his 58 units of NPH.  IV fluid bolus was not given \nbecause he seemed euvolemic on exam and showed mild pulmonary \nedema on chest xray. Orthostatic blood pressures in the hospital \nwas normal and he had no further syncope or presyncope. \n\n# Frontotemporal dementia \/ ALS:  Patient has been experiencing \nrapid and profound deterioration in cognitive function, mood, \nand speech over the past 6 months.  Decline in cognitive \nfunction dates as far back as ___ years.  He was recently seen by \nDr. ___ in ___ Neurology Unit on ___ his \ncare will be transferred to Dr. ___ as Dr. ___ is leaving \nthe practice.  He has been completely dependent for ADLs and \nIADLs and is minimally verbal.  Patient and family members have \nbeen reporting that he has difficulty swallowing in general and \nespecially liquids.  In the hospital, we obtained a neurology, \nphysical therapy, speech and swallow service consult. A video \noropharyngeal swallow study was obtained which showed silent \naspiration to thin liquid and nectar consistency.  After \ndiscussion with patient and his family, the value they placed on \nhis comfort and desire to eat outweighed potential dangers and \nthey agreed to allow him to continue a diet with safety \nmodifications understanding the risks of aspiration.   \nRecommendations are to pre-thicken all liquids and foods prior \nto eating and to crush medications and mix in apple cause or \npuree.  He will followup in ALS and Cognitive Neurology clinic \nas scheduled for further evaluation and discussion for \nnutritional plan going forward.  Topic of feeding tube was \nbroached but family is not yet ready to pursue this step. Family \ndid see neurology and all members were made aware of likely ALS \ndiagnosis.   \n\n# Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus:  Patient has poorly \ncontrolled insulin dependent diabetes mellitus with last HgbA1c \nof 10.5 on ___. A hypoglycemic episode may have been a \npossible contributing factor in causing his syncope leading to \nthis hospitalization.  Patient did not eat anything after \nreceiving his morning insulin dose until the episode of syncope. \nHowever, given that he returned to baseline soon within a minute \nafter lying on the floor is not consistent with hypoglycemia. \nWhile in the hospital, patient was given 54 units of NPH QAM and \na sliding scale of insulin QID. Patient and family members were \neducated on hypoglycemia and not to have the patient go without \neating for long after receiving his insulin.\n\n# Thrombocytopenia:  On initial CBC, patient's platelet count \nwas 95,000.  In the past year, patient's platelet count has been \nranging between 74,000 and 108,000.  This was viewed to be a \nchronic problem and given no evidence nor concern for active \nbleeding, we did not pursue further workup during this \nhospitalization.  Outpatient work up can be considered depending \non patient's overall picture and multiple competing, life \nthreatening medical problems.  \n\n# Hypertension:  Patient's blood pressure has been WNL and \nstable throughout hospitalization.  We continued his home \nantihypertensive medications which included atenolol, \nlisinopril, and hydrochlorothiazide.\n\n# BPH:  Patient has history of BPH.  This was not an active \nissue during this hospitalization and tamsulosin was continued \nthroughout the hospital course.\n.\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\n1. Discuss nutritional plan and other medical concerns as \npatient's neurological disease progress at followup.\n2.

Laboratory, imaging, and EKG studies showed that you did not have a heart attack, bleeding or stroke in the brain, infection of the lungs or urine, abnormal heart rhythm (while you were under monitoring during hospitalization). You likely had a transient drop in blood pressure in combination with low blood sugar that made you feel dizzy after standing up and\/or coming out the restroom. While in the hospital, your blood pressure going from lying to sitting and then standing was normal. When changing positions, please take time and rest in between positions for few minutes to allow your body to accomodate the changes it is experiencing. Also, always receive help from another family member when you need to ambulate and change position for your safety. As discussed above, another contributing factor to your fall may have been a low blood sugar. It is recommended that you eat your breakfast soon after getting your morning insulin shot to prevent profound drop in your blood sugar. Due to concerns about your coughing and choking when swallowing, we asked the speech and swallow service evaluate you and obtained a video oropharyngeal swallow study. This showed silent aspirations to thin liquid and nectar thick consistency. Please do not eat thin liquids and nectar thick foods to avoid an aspiration event. Any food that is thicker in consistency than thin liquids minimizes the risk of aspiration. Please crush medications and mix with apple sauce; you can easily purchase a motar and pestle from a local pharmacy or online. For example, you can get a set for $5.49 on ___. If you cannot crush a medication, you can put the pill into apple sauce and swallow. You were found to have low platelet count in your blood. It seems to have been low, but stable for a while. As you did not show any obvious signs of bleeding during this hospitalization, we just watched the platelet count throughout the hospitalization and it has remained stable."}

She psychiatrically stabilized with uptitration \nof clozapine, but was found to have neutropenia and thus was \ntransferred to the Medicine service at ___ for neutropenic \nprecautions and count recovery.\n\nACUTE ISSUES:\n===============\n# Neutropenia\n# Clozapine Agranulocytosis\nAs above, Ms. ___ was initially admitted to ___ for \ninpatient psychiatric management of her decompensated \nschizophrenia. On admission, her ANC was ___. However, in the \nsetting of increase of clozapine from 25mg QHS to 150mg QHS, her \nANC was found to be 930. Her last dose of clozapine was \n___. Of note, the patient has a history of DLBCL s\/p 6 \ncycles of R-CHOP ___, however other cell lines have been \nstable. It was felt that her neutropenia was less likely due to \nother medications such as risperidone or INH, though INH was \nlater discontinued due to transaminitis as below. During her \nhospitalization on Medicine, her ANC fluctuated. Per discussion \nwith Hem\/Onc, median time to recovery from clozapine is 12 days \nand up to 3 weeks, with expected fluctuations. It was thus felt \nthat a bone marrow biopsy could be deferred. She received 300mg \nx 1 of GCSF on ___, with recovery of ANC to 5690. \nThroughout her stay, she remained afebrile and without \nlocalizing signs of infection.  Pt was given education and \nanticipatory guidance that any fevers > 100.4 or generalized \nillness would require urgent evaluation.  Pt is scheduled to f\/u \nwith hem\/onc on ___ for follow up labs and possible re-dose \nof neupogen.\n\n# Schizophrenia\nAs above, Ms. ___ clozapine was held. However, she \nremained psychiatrically stable on risperidone 4mg PO QHS and \nrisperidone 25mg long acting injectable q2 weeks. Psychiatry \nfollowed during her stay on Medicine with no change in \nrecommendations. She also received ramelteon and lorazepam as \nneeded for insomnia. Last dose of risperidone long acting \ninjectable ___.\n\n# Elevated transaminases\n# Latent TB Infection, on INH\/Pyridoxine\nMs. ___ was noted to have recurrent mild elevation in \ntransaminase levels beginning ___. Possibly medication \nrelated due to uptitrated clozapine given time course, though \ndid not resolve with cessation of clozapine and per discussion \nwith Pharmacy, would not expect this degree of hepatotoxicity \ngiven previously well-tolerated clozapine as outpatient. More \nlikely due to INH administration; patient was started on this \n___ for projected ___nd INH-mediated \nhepatotoxicity can occur within ___ month time frame. RUQUS \nshowed only chronic hepatic hemangiomas, which was consistent \nwith previous CT A\/P ___. Repeat hepatitis serologies \nnegative.

The patient reported that her right hand \nwas weak at that time, though she denied dizziness, and had no \nother complaints.  The patient, for her part does not recall \nmuch prior to this morning.  According to her, she awoke today \nand got ready for breakfast as usual.  However, as she reached \nfor her walker, she noted trouble moving her right arm.  \nSpecifically, she states that she had difficulty grabbing hold \nof her walker, but could not elaborate further.  She began to \ndress herself, but could not finish, and needed assistance, as \nher right hand was shaking a bit.  She has had intermittent \nright hand shaking for at least the past year, and the last \nepisode known to her daughter was one month ago.  She was seen \nby a physician at that time, but was not admitted to the \nhospital.  The patient is not sure why the episodes come on and \nis not aware of any exacerbating or alleviating factors (such as \nmovement).  The daughter witnessed an right hand shaking at \ndinner several months ago; she was able to suppress it by \nholding the right hand and rubbing it.  \n\nThis morning, her daughter was told by staff at her home that \nshe had right hand weakness and perhaps some left leg pain.  The \nreferral for the patient to the emergency room stated that the \npatient had a \"dizzy\" episode, LEFT arm weakness, and \"trouble\" \nwalking.  Though she does get \"dizzy\" at times, the patient does \nnot recall any of these symptoms today.  EMS apparently reported\nthat her right arm shaking was resolving, but that there was no \ndrift, equal grasps, and clear speech.  On arrival here, the \npatient was noted to have LEFT arm and leg weakness by ER staff. \nHer fingerstick at 10:10 am was 151.  She was given 325 mg \naspirin.\n\nThe patient does report that she has had episodes of \"dizziness\" \nfor quite some time.  She describes it as an unsteadiness with \nposition change, such as when she gets up or reaches for an \nobject.  It occurs only for  a \"moment,\" though she is afraid of \nfalling at that time.                \n\nReview of Systems: She has had occasional numbness and tingling \nin the past but does not recall where.

CT head on admission showed no acute \nintracranial hemorrhage, chronic left occipital infarction, and \nchronic lacunar infarctions in the subinsular regions and \nexternal capsules. MRI\/MRA head showed small areas of \nsubcortical increased signal within the left parietal lobe which \nmay indicate acute infarct. Carotid ultrasound showed minimal \nplaque with bilateral less than 40% carotid stenosis. TTE showed \nLVEF >60%, mild to moderate (___) MR, moderate pulmonary artery \nsystolic hypertension. CEs: CK 62-60, TropT <0.01x2, FLP: Chol \n198, ___ 59, LDL 107, HDL 79, HgA1c 6.0%.\nIt was thought that the most likely cause of her stroke was \ncardioembolic. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation \nwho was previously on Coumadin, which had been changed to ASA 81 \nmg daily at her assisted living ___ ___). The team \ncontacted ___, and determined that her ASA had \nbeen discontinued 3 days prior to admission, after it was found \nher Hct was 25.2. During this admission, the decision was made \nto restart ASA 81 daily for anticoagulation. The team was \nconsidering starting Coumadin, but given her recent anemia, high \nfall risk, and since she was not on ASA for the 3 days prior to \nthe stroke, the decision was made to restart the ASA 81 daily \nrather than Coumadin. She will follow up with Dr. ___ in \nNeurology as an outpatient.\n\n2. Atrial Fibrillation. (see above) The patient was continued on \nAmiodarone 200 mg daily, and ASA 81 mg daily.\n\n3. Hypertension. Her antihypertensives were initially held \nduring this admission, given her acute stroke. She was \ndischarged on her home medical regimen of Norvasc 5 mg daily, \nLisinopril 40 mg daily, and Lasix 20 mg daily.\n\n4. Iron Deficiency Anemia. The patient had a Hct of 27.0 on \nadmission. Iron studies showed Fe 23, ferritin 10, TIBC 326; \nVitamin B12 810, folate >20. She was started on FeSO4 325 mg \ndaily with a bowel regimen.\n\n5. Hypothyroidism: Her TSH was 2.8, and she was continued on \nLevothyroxine 100 mcg daily.\n\n6. Depression: She was continued on Sertraline 50 mg daily\n\n7. Left Hip Pain: She complained of left hip pain upon movement \nduring this admission. Left Hip X-ray showed some osteopenia, \nthough the joint space is quite well maintained; no evidence of \nfracture; extensive vascular calcification and a fibroid in the \nleft side of the pelvis.

The tingling has been happening off \nand on for the last ___ years, but this time it is tingling for \nlonger than usual. On exam, she has a mild UMN pattern weakness \nin the 4+ range in both her arm and her leg. There are no \nsensory changes on formal testing with pin. Given her stroke \nrisk factors (ie having afib but only being on ASA given her \nbleeding risk in the setting of bilateral SDH), she had an MRI \nof her brain looking for a stroke that could have led to her \nright sided weakness. There was no change on her MRI from her \nprior MRI in ___. Chronic small bilateral occipital lobe \ninfarcts were noted and similar to that seen in ___ ___s \nchronic small vessel changes. She also had an MRI of her \ncervical spine, which did not show any abnormal cord signal \nintensity. She has some degenerative changes resulting in \nmultilevel neural foraminal narrowing worse at R C3-C4. \n\nOverall, it is unclear what caused her right sided weakness and \nneuropathy. Given that the weakness has been going on for the \nlast week to 4 weeks, it may have been that she had a small left \nsided stroke resulting in a mild right hemiparesis.

Pt's niece noted no relief with metoprolol \ndiscontinuation. She still reported orthostatic symptoms at \nhome, with shaking, amnesia of the event and occasional fecal \nincontinence. DDx concerning for seizure activity peristent \northostatic hypotension and dehydration.  Other possibilities \nincluded acute drops in cardiac output due to persistent \northostasis, or valvular abnormalities, though unlikely given no \nmurmurs. H\/o vertigo, and she was recently restarted on \nmeclazine, which was held during this admission. Persistent and \nsignificant orthostasis, even following IV fluid hydration and \nthigh high compression stockings. Telemetry showed no evidence \nof arrhythmia.  ECHO showed only grade I diastolic dysfunction \nand pulmonary artery hypertension.  All of the patient's home \nantihypertensives were discontinued in hopes that permissive \nhypertension would help with her orthostasis.  However, the pt \ncontinued to have orthostasis and, in fact, her BP normalized \noff antihypertensives. Her orthostatic vital signs, and \nnormalization off antihypertensives, were concerning for \nautonomic dysfunction given  consistent HR with orthostatic \nblood pressures and history of long-term, uncontrolled diabetes. \n The patient was trialed on fludrocortisone which improved the \northostatic hypotension.

This was held while the patient was in house in an \nattempt to further characterize the etiology of her syncope. \nGiven her persistent orthostatic hypotension with optimal \ntherapy it was felt this was non-contributory and meclazine was \ndiscontinued on discharge.\n\n# Hyperlipidemia: Continued home atorvastatin. \n\nTransitional Issues-\n-The patient's home antihypertensives were discontinued during \nher hospitalization given her persistent orthostasis. It was \ndecided to pursue a strategy of permissive hypertension given \nher orthostasis that was unresponsive to IV fluids and \ncompression stockings.\n-The patient was started on fludrocortisone for her orthostatic \nhypotension during this admission which resulted in improvement \nof orthostatic hypotension.\n-There was no evidence on this admission of decubitus ulcers, \nonly evidence of well healed wounds on the pt's R buttock\n-Pt had ECHO which revealed evidence of grade I diastolic \ndysfunction and mild pulmonary arterial hypertension.\n-___ plan:PLAN: Amb with RW and ___ 3x\/day.

Lung volumes are slightly lower with persistent \nconsolidation at the left base likely reflecting combination of \npleural fluid and left lower lobe atelectasis or pneumonia.  \nStreaky opacities at the right base are slightly worse,\nsuggestive of increasing atelectasis.  No pulmonary edema.  No \npneumothorax. \nGiven the left basilar airspace process, assessment of cardiac \nand mediastinal\ncontours is limited on this study.\n\n___ CXR:\nInterval removal of right internal jugular vascular catheter \nwith no visible pneumothorax.  Stable cardiomegaly.  Slight \nimproved aeration at right lung base, but no appreciable change \nin left retrocardiac opacity with adjacent small left pleural \neffusion.  Small right pleural effusion extending\ninto the minor fissure appears unchanged.\n \n___ CXR: \nDense consolidation and volume loss at the left lung base are \ndiagnostic of left lower lobe collapse, present without \nappreciable change since ___.  Pulmonary vascular \ncongestion persists in the right lung and a small region of \nbasal atelectasis or consolidation has changed in severity and \nprecise location over the past several days but not in overall \nseverity.  Severe enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is \nunchanged.  ET tube and right internal jugular line are in \nstandard placements and an upper enteric drainage tube passes to \nthe upper stomach and out of view.  No pneumothorax.  At least a \nsmall left pleural effusion is present, secondary  to the left \nlowerlobe collapse. \n\n___ RENAL US: \nLimited examination due to poor acoustic penetration. 2.7 cm \nleft kidney upper pole lesion appears consistent with simple \ncyst. \n\n___ CT CHEST:\n1. Bibasilar atelectasis and left basilar mucus plugging of the \nsubsegmental airways. \n2. 7 mm right middle lobe lung nodule. As per the ___ \n___ Pulmonary Nodule Guidelines, followup chest CT is \nrecommended in ___ months for a low risk patient and ___ months \nfor a high risk patient. \n3. Dilated main pulmonary artery compatible with pulmonary \narterial \nhypertension. \n\n___ CT HEAD: \n1. No evidence of acute intracranial process.   \n2. Opacification of the left mastoid and middle ear cavity with \npooled \nsecretions in the nasopharynx are likely related to the \npatient's intubated status. \n3. Evidence of global atrophy \n\n___ CTAB: \n1. No explanation for hypotension. \n2. Nonspecific free fluid underneath both diaphragms and along \nthe right \npericolic gutter. This may be a result of volume resuscitation. \n3. Questionable small bowel wall thickening most likely \nrepresent s \nundermixing of oral contrast and fluid in small bowel loops. \n4. Upper pole left renal lesion does not meet criteria for a \nsimple cyst, but may represent a complex cyst.  Further \nevaluation with ultrasound is \nrecommended. \n\n___ LENIs: \nNo right or left leg DVT.\n\n___ echo: \nThe left atrium is normal in size. The left ventricular cavity \nis unusually small. Overall left ventricular systolic function \nis normal (LVEF 55%). Right ventricular chamber size is normal. \nwith normal free wall contractility. The diameters of aorta at \nthe sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. There are \nsimple atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are three aortic \nvalve leaflets. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral \nvalve leaflets are structurally normal. Trivial mitral \nregurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion. \nIMPRESSION: No ascending aortic dissection. Small LV cavity with \nnormal systolic function.\n\n___ portable abdomen:\nLimited study demonstrates moderately prominent loops of small \nbowel similar to that seen previously, which may be due to air \nswallowing \nversus obstruction.  If there is high suspicion for obstruction, \nan abdominal CT may be obtained. \n\n___ CT HEAD: no acute intracranial process\n\n___ CT abd\/pelvis: no RP bleed or solid organ injury. \n4mm right lung base nodule, ___ f\/u if hx of malignancy or \nsmoking. otherwise, no f\/u needed. hypodense hepatic lesion, \nincompletely characterized, likely cysts or hemangiomas. \n\nMICROBIOLOGY\n===========\n___ 4:03 pm URINE      Source: Catheter. \n\n                            **FINAL REPORT ___\n\n   URINE CULTURE (Final ___:    NO GROWTH. \n\n___ 4:03 pm STOOL     CONSISTENCY: NOT APPLICABLE\n      Source: Stool. \n\n                            **FINAL REPORT ___\n\n   C. difficile DNA amplification assay (Final ___: \n      Negative for toxigenic C. difficile by the Illumigene DNA\n      amplification assay. \n           (Reference Range-Negative). \n\n___ 9:30 am BRONCHIAL WASHINGS\n      PLEASE RUN DESPITE ORAL FLUID .

Required three pressors (norepinephrine, \nphenylepherine, and vasopressin) for maintenance of MAPs>60mmHg. \nThese were down-titrated as tolerated.  The patient was also \nfluid resuscitated with boluses of NS.  He was empirically \nstarted on vancomycin, cefepime, and metronidazole, and \neventually transitioned to meropenem secondary to persistence of \nleukocytosis and fevers.  Antibiotics were discontinued on ___. \n Culture data was all negative.  Echocardiogram revealed normal \nventricular function.  Patient continued to be afebrile and \nwithout leukocytosis throughout the remainder of his hospital \ncourse. \n\n# Respiratory failure: Patient was electively intubated for \nworsening metabolic abnormalities. Mechanical ventilation was \nweaned as tolerated and he was extubated on ___. Following \nextubation, the patient was weaned to room air, but later on in \nhis hospital course, he developed a new oxygen requirement.  \nFurosemide trial was attempted, and incentive spirometry was \nencouraged.  Patient was satting at92% RA on day of discharge \nand no longer had a demand for oxygen.\n\n# Hyperkalemia: Likely elevated in the setting of renal failure. \nHad questionable peaked T-waves in the ED.  He received \ntreatment with D50, insulin, and albuterol at OSH with \npersistently elevated potassium.  He also received kayexelate, \ncalcium gluconate, D50, insulin in fluids in the ___ ED.  Due \nto persistent metabolic abnormalities, he was started on CVVH.  \nHis potassium improved and normalized with return of his kidney \nfunction. \n\n# Acute on chronic kidney injury: Patient with elevated \ncreatinine in the acute setting.  FeNa of 1% which is equivocal \nfor prerenal vs ATN.  Nephrotoxic medications were avoided and \nhis medications were renally dosed. He was started on CVVH as \nabove and nephrology recommendations were followed. Ultimately, \nhis kidney function improved and he did not require any renal \nreplacement therapy. Cr at the time of discharge was 1.5. \n\n# Atrial fibrillation: CHADS score of 3. Required cardioversion \nseveral times secondary to hypotension and RVR with HR to the \n160s. An amiodarone drip was initiated but aborted ___ after no \nimprovement in heart rate.  He was also refractory to diltiazem \ngtt and esmolol gtt.  This likely was exacerbated by metabolic \nderangements, refractory shock, and atrial stretch from \nhypervolemia.  He was digoxin loaded ___ and this was \ncontinued during his hospitalization. Amiodarone was restarted \n___.  As pressors were weaned off and blood pressure \nstabilized, metoprolol was intiated with improvement in his \nheart rate. Further, he was reinitiated on an amiodarone drip \nfor loading for a total of ten grams. His anticoagulation \noriginally was held secondary to supratherapeutic levels. It was \nnot reinitiated at the time of call out from the MICU. \nCardiology recommended call out to the cardiology service for \nfurther management. Once on the cardiology service, the patient \ncontinued to be in atrial fibrillation, with rates into \n100-120s.  Patient was initially maintained on digoxin and \nmetoprolol, but was not well rate controlled. Diltiazem was \nadded, but heart rates continued to be elevated. This lack of \nresponse to oral medications was thought to be due to \nmalabsoption in the setting of large-volume diarrhea discussed \nbelow. As such, efforts were made to better control the \ndiarrhea, and as his bowels slowed, heart rates became better \ncontrolled.  Patient's warfarin was restarted on ___ when his \nINR came back down to 2.7.  It was initiated at a dose of 2.5 \nmg.  Patient's INR will need to be rechecked on ___.\n\n# Diarrhea: At baseline the patient has a protuberant abdomen. \nClinically, there was a concern for intraabdominal process \ncontributing to his refractory shock. His stool cultures, \nincluding C. diff PCR, were negative. He had a Flexiseal placed \nfor rectal decompression.  He continued to have diarrhea that \nwas believed to be non-infectious and related to bowel loss of \nhis normal gut flora.  He was started on loperamide and tincture \nof opium while in the MICU. Once the floor, the patient was \ngiven cholestyramine in addition to loperamide with eventual \nimprovement in his diarrhea.  \n\n# Anemia: Patient with baseline hematocrit in ___.  This has \nbeen downtrending since admission.  Patient has had guaiac \npositive stools this admission, but no overt melena.  Guaiac \npositive stools were not unexpected in the setting of large \nvolume diarrhea.  Iron studies were consistent with anemia of \nchronic disease.  On ___, the patient was experiencing some \nbright blood mixed with stool, likely from active hemorrhoids.  \nHematocrit was stable between ___, and he was not orthostatic. \n He will need daily hematocrit checks and hemorrhoid care.\n\n# Citrate administration: Iatrogenic administration into \nsystemic circulation. Discovered in the ___ of ___ with \ntoxicology consulted for recommendations. Calcium was checked \nq2hrs for monitoring of hypocalcemia with calcium gluconate for \nrepletion. Adverse side effects of citrate toxicity include \nhypocalcemia and QTc prolongation. Ionized Ca++ was monitored \nand was maintained >1 with calcium gluconate administration. Per \ntoxicology, likely cleared from system over 24hrs. Never \nexperienced QTc prolongation.   \n\n# Metabolic acidosis: Likely secondary to renal failure and \ninability to clear hydrogen ions. Lactic acid normal. Patient \nreceived bicarbonate in the ED. Improved with management and \nresolution of shock. \n\n# Toxic metabolic encephalopathy: Following extubation the \npatient's mental status waxed and waned. This continued for a \nmajority of his hospital stay. The cause was thought to be \nsecondary to many of the metabolic derangements discussed above \nas well as disturbances in sleep\/wake cycles. As the ___ \nhospital course became more stable, his mental status improved \nas well. \n\n# Hyperphosphatemia: Elevated on admission likely in the setting \nof renal failure. Improved with CVVH and return of renal \nfunction. \n\nINACTIVE ISSUES\n---------------\n# Diabetes mellitus: Blood glucose monitored and managed with \ninsulin sliding scale.\n\n# Hypertension: Anti-hypertensives initially were held secondary \nto triple pressor requirement. They were restarted as tolerated. \n\n# Hyperlipidemia: On simvastatin\n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\n--------------------\n- 7 mm right middle lobe lung nodule. As per the ___ \n___ Pulmonary Nodule Guidelines, followup chest CT is \nrecommended in ___ months for a low risk patient and ___ months \nfor a high risk patient.  \n- needs follow up with renal in ___ months with ___\n-Please check Chem 10 daily and give IVF if Cr bumps and patient \nappears volume depleted\n- Monitor stool output, loperamide as needed\n- Monitor daily hematocrit to check for stability and please \nprovide hemarrhoid wound care\n- Monitor heart rates, titrate rate controlling agents as needed\n- Monitor digoxin levels every ___ days or if renal function \nworsens to ensure not accumulating toxic levels\n- Please check daily INR and adjust warfarin dose as needed\n- Please d\/c PICC line when not needed for access\n\n \n\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

During your stay you required a number of different antibiotics to help eliminate a suspected infection. You were also found to be in an abnormal heart rhythm, called atrial fibrillation. Due to this abnormal heart rhythm and your infection, your blood pressures dropped and you needed special medications to help you maintain a good blood pressure. In order to help you breathe, you needed to be intubated and you also required a form of dialysis to help remove fluid from your lungs. After an extended stay in the ICU, you eventually were able to be taken off the ventilator and you blood pressure stabilized. You were transferred to the floor.

IMPRESSION: Normal \nventilation \/ perfusion scan.\n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ year old female with a history of CREST syndrome c\/b chronic \nassociated pericardial effusion, esophageal dysmotility, mild \npulmonary artery hypertension, presenting with acute worsening \nof progressive dyspnea on exertion.  \n\n# Hypoxia\/Dyspnea:  Differential included recurrent pericardial \neffusion, pulmonary fibrosis ___ scleroderma, worsening \npulmonary arterial hypertension, chronic aspiration from \nesophageal dysmotility, MAC given age and pulmonary nodules. \nLess likely PNA (normal WBC, no cough, fever), CHF (normal BNP), \nPE (normal D-dimer). The leading causes were sufficiently \ninvestigated via TTE (with bubble), RHC, CT, VQ Scan. Mild \nworsening of pulmonary artery hypertension was observed on right \nheart catheterization and cardiac output improved with \nvasodilating agent. Findings were not enough to explain degree \nof dyspnea.  Ambulation on day prior to discharge after warming \nhands under hot water showed a good pleth and that she was in \nfact not hypoxic with ambulation. The low oximtery values that \nhad motivated the workup up of dyspnea on exertion were then \nthought to be spurious findings, related to her Raynaud's \nsymptoms. With this in mind, her dyspnea was thought to be \nsecondary to chronic reconditioning. \n\n# Sjo___'s syndrome: The patient has chronic sicca symptoms. \nCyclosporine eye drops were non formulary so will need to \ndiscuss with pharmacy in the morning regarding alternative or \nwhether patient may take her own meds. Continued eye drops and \nmouth moistener.\n\n# HTN: Chronic. Continued furosemide daily (likely for chronic \n___ edema). \n\n# GERD: Chronic in the setting of lower esophageal dysfunction \nfrom CREST syndrome. Continued PPI, substituted protonix for \nlansoprazole given non formulary.  \n\n# Limited Scleroderma\/CREST syndrome: Complicated by Raynaud's \nphenomenon, esophageal dysmotility, chronic pericardial effusion \nand pulmonary manifestations. Patient with sclerodactyly and \ntelangiectasias on exam. \n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\n- Warm her hands under hot water prior to receiving any reads of \nher oxygen level. Hypoxia determined to spurious, artifact of \nRaynaud's (ear and forehead do not work) \n- A calcium channel blocker may be indicated for symptomatic \nimprovement of Raynaud's, consider this at followup.\n- Mild worsening of pulmonary artery hypertension was observed \non right heart catheterization. Cardiac output improved with \nvasodilating agent. Findings were likely not enough to explain \ndyspnea but if this were to be progressive, consider pulmonary \nvasodilator in the future.\n- On CT chest: Multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules range up to \n4 mm in diameter, many of which are new since the prior CT from \n___. Follow-up imaging was recommended in 12 months by \nradiology. Will require 3 month repeat chest CT for mediastinal \nlymphadenopathy. Need for additional imaging of pulmonary \nnodules can be determined after that chest CT\n- Deferred starting night time oxygen therapy as home values \nlikely spurious, can be continue to be discussed as an \noutpatient\n- Followup with PCP and pulmonologist in two weeks. \n- Encourage exercise and ambulation.\n\n  \n\n# Code: Full  \n# Emergency Contact: Daughter ___ (cell) ___  \n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

You were evaluated with many procedures and imaging tests which showed no clear reason for your dyspnea and hypoxia. You were found to have a pericardial effusion and mild pulmonary artery hypertension, but not enough to explain your degree of dyspnea. However, we discovered that your Raynaud's was likely the reason for your apparent low oxygen, which was giving us false readings of your oxygen level. In the future you will need to warm your hands under warm water prior to having your oxygen level checked. You should exercise and remain active."}

He was\nsubsequently transferred to ___ for neurology evaluation.\n\nAt ___, the patient seemed somewhat improved per son, but still\nnot back to baseline, and continued to be confused and\ndisoriented, thinking the year was ___. The patient was able to\nprovide some history now, stating that he had had a seizure and\nwas lying on the floor for 4 hours, unable to get up. He does \nnot\nrecall the actual event itself but recalls the period of lying \non\nthe floor. After some time, he was able to get up.

He was actually admitted to ___\nNeurology service in ___ for confusion followed by a convulsive\nseizure for which he was intubated - at that time he had been\nprescribed anticonvulsants which he stopped taking prior to the\nseizure due to financial issues, and was resumed on keppra 750mg\nBID upon discharge. MRI had showed evidence of a prior right\ntemporal\/occipital lobe hemorrhage, which was presumed to be the\nmost likely seizure focus.

Neither he nor his son can tell me why his\nkeppra was switched. The patient endorses full compliance, which\nthe son is unable to corroborate because the patient is in \ncharge\nof his own medications and again does not tend to share\ninformation.

It was felt that these were due to progression of \nher disease, including bilateral pleural effusions. She was \nnoted to be tachycardic which was felt to be related to \ndehydration or hypoxia. She was given one liter of intravenous \nfluids in clinic, and 80mg\/m2 of paclitaxel to help reduce tumor \nburden. During treatment, she became acutely short of breath and \nhypoxic with oxygen saturation in the 80___. She was tachycardic \nwith a heart rate up to 150, respiratory rate of 50-60, and \nsystolic blood pressure of 160.

Her lung exam was reported as \nwheezy with decreased breath sounds. Nebulizers were given \nwithout improvement. She was then urgently intubated with \netomidate and succinylcholine; per the ED, there was no evidence \nof airway edema. After intubation her systolic blood pressure \nremained in the 80-90 range. A left internal jugular central \nline was placed, however this was removed after it was found to \nbe coiled. Due to a right-sided port-a-cath, a right femoral \ncentral line was then placed. She was given 1 gram of vancomycin \nand 4.5 grams of Zosyn. She was on 1 mg drip of versed for \nsedation and was cooperative and alert and denied any distress. \nShe received an additional two liters of intravenous fluids. A \nchest CT was obtained to further evaluate her hypoxia with \npreliminary read of enlarged pleural effusions, but no pulmonary \nembolism (though sub-optimal given right lower lobe collapse). \nHer abdominal implants appear larger. Of note, she had been on \nlevofloxacin as an outpatient since an admission in late ___ \nfor febrile neutropenia. \n\nUpon arrival to the ICU, she appeared anxious, following \ncommands, but in no pain.

She was noted to\nhave a mass on physical examination.\n- ___ CT scan performed at ___: \nSmall nodules in the upper abdomen, up to 1 cm, consistent with\nomental implants.  There was trace ascites and 12 cm cystic and\nsolid mass was noted in the pelvis, intimate with the sigmoid\ncolon.  CA-125 was ___.\n- ___:  Exploratory laparotomy, collection of ascites, \nand\nradical resection of pelvic masses, TAH\/BSO, infracolic\nomentectomy, and an optimal tumor debulking performed by Dr.\n___.  Operative findings included a 14 cm mass which was\nreplacing left ovary as well as several pelvic implants.  \nOptimal\ntumor debulking was performed, with removal of all pelvic \ndisease\nwith the exception of 1-2 mm nodules in the right hemidiaphragm\nand right colon.  There was no ovarian rupture.  Surgical\npathology revealed papillary serous ovarian cancer involving the\nright and left ovaries, 10.5 cm in greatest dimension, grade \nIII,\nwith extensive venous and lymphatic invasion and peritoneal\nmetastases greater than 2 cm in greatest dimension (stage IIIC,\npT3pNxMx).  Of note, the fallopian tube was dilated by luminal\ntumor; thus, although intraepithelial neoplasia was not seen, \nthe\napparent gross continuity of the tube lumen with the ovarian\ntumor mass raised the possibility of tubal origin.\n- ___:  Cycle 1, Day 1 of chemotherapy with intravenous\ncarboplatin (AUC of 5) and paclitaxel 175 mg\/m2.\n- ___: Laparoscopic placement of intraperitoneal port\nfor Cycle 2 of chemotherapy, consisting of paclitaxel 135mg\/m2 \nIV\non Day 1 followed by cisplatin 75 mg\/m2 IP on Day 2 and\npaclitaxel 60 mg\/m2 IP on Day 8.

Her respiratory failure was likely related to IVF in \nthe setting of poor respiratory reserve (she has low lung \nvolumes and also had a large R pleural effusion). While \nintubated her pleural effusion was drained of 1.3 liters and she \nwas extubated on ___.  She did well post extubation and was \noxygenating well on room air.  She remained somewhat tachypneic \nto 26 however this was improved from her preintubation \nrespiratory rate of 60.  She was on antibiotics from ___ to a.m. \nof ___ for possible pneumonia, upon further review of CTA chest \nand CXR and cultures she was not thought to have pneumonia.  CTA \nnegative for PE. Her dyspnea on exertion eventually resolved as \nit seemed the thoracentesis helped her symptoms significantly. \n\nTachycardia: This improved during her ICU stay however she \nremained between 110-120 sinus tachycardia.  She had low grade \ntemperatures, had just rec'd chemo, was anemic and in mild \nrespiratory distress which are all reasons for tachycardia. Her \ntachycardia was eventually thought to be due to her chronic \nfevers. \n\nReported fevers, leukocytosis: Differential includes secondary \nto progressive disease versus infectious process. No positive \nculture data, she was on broad spectrum abx (vanc \/ zosyn) from \n___, these were discontinued on ___ given lack of positive \nculture data and no clear source of infection. With absolutely \nno culture data positive and extensive work ups in the past \nthese fevers were deemed to be due to her ovarian cancer. In \nfact she had been having fevers for several months, and her \noutpatient oncologist concurred with this conclusion. \n\nStage IIIC Ovarian versus fallopian tube cancer: Status-post \nnumerous procedures and chemotherapy regimens. \n\nElevated troponin: mildly elevated troponin as well as MB index \nwith a peak CK in the ___, given low CK elevation and no chest \nsymptoms this was likely related to demand ischemia related to \nhypoxia and tachycardia.  Given aspirin initially but given that \nthis was likely demand the aspirin was discontinued.  \n \nMedications on Admission:\n- Magic mouth wash\n- Metoclopramide 10 mg Q6H PRN\n- Morphine ___ mg PO q4H PRN\n- Omeprazole 20 mg daily\n- Zofran 8 mg Q8H PRN \n- Prchloraperazine 10 mg Q6H PRN\n- Risperidone 2 mg BID\n- Zyrtec \n- Clonazepam 1 mg daily or BID\n- Dexamethasome 4 BID prior to chemotherapy\n- Diphenhydramine 25 mg Q6H PRN\n- Levofloxacin 750 mg Q48H\n- Tyelnol ___ mg Q6H\n- Calcium carbonate 500 mg Tablet three times a day\n \nDischarge Medications:\n1.

You continued to have fevers all day but all of our imaging and cultures were negative for infection. Your fevers are most likely due to your cancer. Because your heart rate was fast, we also obtained an echocardiogram of your heart, which showed reduced function of unknown causes. We started you on a beta blocker drug called metoprolol to help lower you heart rate and improve your heart function.

Overnight into \npost-operative day one he was noted to have hypotension and low \nurine output and was triggered for this. He also had rapid \natrial fibrillation at this time which resolved with Lopressor. \nHe was given 2 liters of IV fluids with some response in blood \npressure and urine output. In the morning of post-operative day \non, his hematocrit was 30, the drain output was stable, he was \nalert and oriented. He met with the wound and ostomy nursing \nteam for colostomy teaching. He was provided a ___ \ninterpreter throughout the day. Overnight, the patient again had \nlow urine output and systolic blood pressures in the 90's. His \nheart rate began to slowly increase. In the early morning, he \nwas noted to have rapid atrial fibrillation and hypotension with \na systolic blood pressure to the mid 80's. He was noted to have \nhematuria which developed overnight as well as some new right \nflank ecchymosis. The right drain output was rather sanguinous \nhowever, was not a concerning amount. A CBC was sent an his \nhematocrit was noted to be 20 from 26 the evening prior. This \nwas acute blood loss anemia related to recent surgery. The \nsubcutaneous heparin and PO aspirin were held. He was ordered \nfor 5mg of IV lopressor and 2 units of packed red blood cells. \nHe responded well to the Lopressor and was rate controlled. As \nsoon as the blood products were made available, they were \ninitiated by the nursing staff. Cardiac enzymes were sent as a \nprecaution and were negative. He was interviewed with a ___ \ninterpreter and was feeling relatively well, his chronic back \npain was irritating him however, throughout the morning this \nimproved. A post-transfusion hematocrit was ordered and was 23. \nAn additional unit of blood was given and the post transfusion \nhematocrit appropriately rose to 26.2. The patient remained \nstable and was started on sips on ___, post op day 5, and was \nadvanced to clears. POD 6 he was started on his home dosages of \nHCTZ and labetalol, although his Coumadin continued to be held. \nHe continued to have evolving ecchymosis over his abdomen and \ngenital area however, hematocrits were all stable and the bleed \nwas thought to have been resolved and the bruising old blood. \nPOD 7 he was tolerating a regular diet and out of bed ambulating \nindependently. Overnight he was found to be retaining urine in \nhis bladder with the bladder scan. He was straight cath-ed and \n700 cc came out of his bladder. Later on in the morning he \ndescribed a fullness sensation just below his umbilicus. He was \nbladder scanned again and was found to be retaining urine again \nand a Foley catheter was inserted. Again 700 cc of clear urine \nwas expelled, though the urine was found to have clots and later \nthe urine had a reddish hue. This was watched closely. A stat \nINR was 1.1 and his HCT remained stable, 28->27.8. His urine \ncleared up on its own and was clear yellow. He had several \nteaching sessions about how to take care of his ostomy as well \nas his Foley in ___ with an interpreter. He was breifly \ntreated for a urinary tract infection, however when the urine \nculture was negative, the Cipro was discontinued. On the morning \nof ___, he was doing quite well. Throughout his stay, the \n___ incision remained intact and did not rain or appear \ninfected, appropriate ___ precautions were maintained. The \nFoley cathter was again removed and he was due to void at ___ \nand a bladder scan should be preformed at ___, a Foley \nshould be replaced if there is more than 400 cc of urine in his \nbladder. Dr. ___ will continue to hold warfarin which the \npatient takes for atrial fibrillation until he is seen in clinic \nand he will order to restart. On ___, the patient was stable \nfrom a neurological and pain standpoint, was hemodynamically \nstable, in no respiratory distress or oxygen support, he was \nstable from a gastrointestinal standpoint, passing air and stool \nthrough ostomy bag. The patient was ready for discharge to \nrehab. We will continue to hold the patient's Coumadin until \nfollow-up with Dr. ___.

She \nwas also endorsing cough productive of green or bloody sputum as \nwell as dyspnea. Given her risk factors for hospital-acquired \npneumonia and MDR organisms, she was started on: CefePIME 2 g IV \nQ12H, Vancomycin 1000 mg IV Q 12H, Levofloxacin 500 mg PO\/NG \nQ24H. She was also started on Tamiflu, which was discontinued \nwhen influenza DFA came back negative. Blood cultures and sputum \ncultures were also sent. Interventional pulmonology was \nconsulted regarding the utility of stenting given her recurrent \ninfections and possible bronchomalacia. She underwent a \nbronchoscopy showing 98-100% collapse of her L mainstem \nbronchus. BAL and suction of LLL was performed and cultures were \nsent. No growth has been seen on blood or BAL cultures to date, \nand sputum culture grew only commensal organisms. The patient \nhas been scheduled for rigid bronchoscopy with placement of a \nsilicone Y-stent as an outpatient on ___. PFTs and a 6-min \nwalk test were performed as a baseline for post-procedure \ncomparison. She will follow up ___ weeks following stent \nplacement to reassess pulmonary function and determine whether \nshe is a candidate for permanent repair via tracheobronchoplasty \nwith mesh placement. At discharge she was afebrile with no \ncomplaint of dyspnea and infrequent cough occasionally \nproductive of yellow sputum. A PICC line was place prior to \ndischarge for continuation of a 10 day course of Vancomycin and \nCefepime as an outpatient. ___ follow up was arranged.\n.\n# Asthma: She was continued on her home asthma medications \nincluding albuterol, singulair, and advair. She was also given \nalbuterol, ipratropium, and mucomyst nebulizers for symptomatic \nrelief of her asthma. \n.\n# Anemia: No previous history of anemia per patient. Crits were \nstable this admission at around 35.  Iron studies were sent and \nwere all within normal limits. Reticulocyte count came back at \n1.6 indicating some degree of marrow suppression. IV Ig products \nare known to induce hemolytic anemia, however her haptoglobin \nand LDH levels were also within normal limits. Her smear was \nabnormal with 2+ hypochromia, 2+ anisocytosis, 1+ \npoikilocytosis, 1+ macrocytosis, occasional microcytosis, \noccasional polychromasia, 1+ schistocytes, 1+ burr cells. As she \nhas been taking many antibiotics over the past three months, \nseveral of which are known to cause anemia, and as it is \npossible she has had recent respiratory viral infections that \ncould have resulted in some degree of marrow suppression, \nsuggest outpatient follow up to reassess her anemia when not \nacutely ill or taking antibiotics.\n. \n# Chest pain: During ___ placement the patient reported the \nsudden onset of a \"fluttering\" in her chest and feeling like her \nheart was racing. She also reported mild chest pain that was \npositional and worsened when she was sitting up. The PICC line \nwas pulled back 1cm with resolution of symptoms. CXR was then \nperformed that showed PICC line tip located in SVC. EKG at the \ntime showed mild STD in lateral leads. The same symptoms \nrecurred several hours later, and a repeat EKG at that time was \nnormal. Cardiac enzymes were negative x2. She was monitored on \ntelemetry overnight. She was asymptomatic for the rest of the \nadmission. This episode was thought to be due either to a \ntransient arrhythmia induced by advancement of the PICC into the \nright heart, or due to tachycardia secondary to anxiety and \nalbuterol tx. \n.\n# Yeast Infection: On hospital day one she reported symptoms of \nvaginal pruritis and burning consistent with prior yeast \ninfections.  She was given a one-time dose of fluconazole with \nresolution of her symptoms by the following day.\n.\n# Urinary frequency: On hosp day one, she reported increased \nurinary frequency and voiding only small amounts of urine with \neach attempt. UA was sent. UA showed few bacteria without \nelevated WBCs or hematuria. Symptoms resolved by the following \nday. \n.\n#Post-nasal drip: She brought her home nasal sprays with her and \nused them as these medications are not on formulary. \n.\n# IgG Deficiency: Stable with outpatient infusions of IV Ig q4-6 \nweeks.\n.\n# Depression: Stable. She was continued on her home meds: \nWellbutrin 150mg, \nCelexa 10 mg.\n.\n# Mood disorder (?Cyclothymia). Stable, continued her on \nOxcarbazepine 150mg.\n.\n# s\/p thyroidectomy.

Prominent ventricles and \nsulci suggest age-related involutional changes or atrophy.  \nPeriventricular white matter hypodensities are consistent with \nchronic small vessel ischemic disease. The basal cisterns appear \npatent and there is preservation of gray-white differentiation.  \n \nNo fracture is identified. There is a partially opacified right \nmastoid, but the middle ear is well aerated. The paranasal \nsinuses are clear. \nAterosclerotic mural calcification of the internal carotid \narteries is noted. No facial or cranial soft tissue \nabnormalities are present. \nIMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.  \n\n# ECHO ___\nConclusions  \nThe left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thickness, \ncavity size and regional\/global systolic function are normal \n(LVEF >55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion \nare normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally \nnormal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis. Mild \n(1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are \nmildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There \nis mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no \npericardial effusion. \n\nIMPRESSION: Normal global and regional biventricular systolic \nfunction. Mild aortic and mitral regurgitation. Mild pulmonary \nhypertension.\nCompared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, \nthe findings are similar.   \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ with Stage 4 CKD, pAfib, HTN, HLD, presented with resting \nchest pain this AM.  \n\nACTIVE ISSUES \n# Atrial flutter\/fibrillation: Pt has history of paroxysmal \natrial fibrillation.  He was found to have atrial flutter based \non the EKG obtained by the EMS at home.  It is possible that the \nchest pain is secondary to atrial flutter, although when the EKG \nwas done, his symptom has resolved.  Pt was subsequently found \nto be in sinus rhythm in both ED and cardiology floor.  His ECHO \ndid not show structural heart disease.  His CHADS score is 2.  \nInterestingly, he was switched off coumadin to lovenox given \nconcerns of lack of INR checks as he travels outside of US.  We \ndiscontinued his lovenox and started him back on coumadin.  We \nalso increased his metoprolol to 150 mg daily.  Pt was also \narranged to have Kings of Hearts monitoring to establish the \ncorrelationship between his arrhythmia and symptoms. \n\n# Chest pain: The presentation of pt's chest pain is more \nconsistent wtih GERD.  Also possible is tachycardia in the \nsetting of atrial fibrllation\/flutter.  His cardiac enzymes were \nnegative.  He was given omeprazole for GERD.  His H.pylori \nserology was negative.\n\nCHRONIC ISSUES \n# CKD: Pt has close to baseline Cr.  We continued his calcitriol \nand nephrocaps.  \n\n# Anemia and thrombocytopenia: Pt was found to have chronic \nanemia and thrombocytopenia.  These issues were not pursued \nduring this admission, however should be evaluated in the \noutpatient setting.

No focal \nconsolidation. No pleural effusion or evidence of pneumothorax \nis seen. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable and \nunremarkable. \n  \nIMPRESSION: \n1. No acute cardiopulmonary process. \n2. Relative stable appearance of multiple radiopaque structures \nprojecting \nover the thorax, question shrapnel. \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n# Atrial flutter and A Fib with RVR: He has a history of atrial \nfibrillation but no previous documented episodes of atrial \nflutter. On admission he was taking 100mg metoprolol succinate \nBID for rate control.  His HR was 130s, which broke with evening \ndose of metoprolol and was continued on 100mg metoprolol \ntartrate BID.  Had previously taken amiodarone 200mg daily for \nrate control, but this was discontinued in ___ for unclear \nreason.  He was given NS IV and monitored on telemetry.  He was \ninitially borderline hypotensive with SBP in 100s, but this \nabated with fluids.  Had one episode of atrial flutter with rate \nin 120s on ___ that broke after 5mg IV metoprolol times three \nand 15 mg IV diltiazem. He ws continued on diltiazem 30mg PO \nQ6hrs following this episode, but had ___ second pauses and \nbradycardia to high ___ that night.  Diltiazem was discontinued \nand doses of metoprolol were held intermittently for HR <60.  \nFor the 48hrs prior to discharge he was in both sinus rhythm and \natrial fibrillation and rate remained mostly ___.  Given the \ncourse, it appears that is rate is somewhat labile.  Though \nfurther rate control may not be needed if her remains euvolemic, \nhe may need to re-start amiodarone if he has further episodes of \nRVR.  Pharmacy suggested that he does not need to take loading \ndoses of amiodarone if it is re-started prior to 50 days from \n___ and can begin 200mg daily.  He will follow-up with his \ncardiologist, Dr. ___ want to consider ablation in \nthe future.\n.  \n# Blood Pressure Control: The patient was intially borderline \nhypotensive, had orthostatic blood pressure changes and was very \ndizzy.  This was thought most likely secondary to dehyrdation in \nthe setting of gastroenteritis and poor PO intake as well as \nmedication effects and atrial flutter.  His record documents \nhistory of autonomic neuropathy, but no further information was \navailable.  He had complained of dizziness ___ after his prior \ndischarge and stopped taking some of his antihypertensives \nincluding lisinopril, amlodipine and isosorbide mononitrate with \nsome improvement.  Prior to this admission, he had re-started \nlisinopril. Furosemide was held on admission along with \namlodipine 10mg, but lisinopril and isosorbide were continued.  \nAfter volume repletion and rate control, his BP began to climb \nto SBP 120s-160s day of discharge.  On discharge, his furosemide \nwas re-started. If further control is needed, he may need to add \nback amlodipine.\n.\n# Abdominal pain: This pain was lower abdomen, dull and crampy, \nthought to be due to viral gastroenteritis and constipation. It \nwas found to resolve with passing gas and bowel movements.  The \npatient was continued on simethicone, acetaminophen, \nondansetron, and bowel regimen for symptomatic management.  He \nhad several episodes of loose stools on hosptial day 2.  \nFollowing this, he did not pass stool until the day prior to \nadmission, and at that point his abdmoinal pain resolved. He \nreported having a colonoscopy last year at ___ that was \nnormal. \n.  \n# CKD: He has known CKD likely from underlying diabetic \nnephropathy and hypertension. His baseline creatinine appears to \nbe 1.3-1.5, and he was 1.6 on admission with hyponatremia to 132 \nand realtive hyperkalemia of 5.2  With IV NS, the electrolyte \nderrangements resolved and his Cr trended down to 1.0. \n.  \n# DM: Followed FSBS and gave insulin sliding scale with \ncontinued home standing 70\/30 25 units BID.  His FSBS were \ntypically ___.\n.  \n# CAD: Has history of MI, wasn't taking isosorbide mononitrate.  \nThis was restarted, and he was continued on beta blocker and \nfull dose ASA while inpatient. He was ruled out for MI with \ncardiac biomarkers.  \n.  \n# Hyperlipidemia: Lipids ___ LDL 97, HDL 37, Total 197, TGs 343. \n Not currently on statin as outpatient. Should be considered by \noutpatient providers.\n \nMedications on Admission:\nMEDICATIONS: per Atrius and patient list\nMetoprolol Succinate 200 mg daily  \nFurosemide 40 mg daily  \nLisinopril 10 mg daily  \nWarfarin 5 mg daily  \nInsulin 70\/30 25units BID  \nASPIRIN 81 MG daily  \n\nPrescribed but not taking\nIsosorbide Mononitrate 60 mg daily  \nNITROQUICK 0.4 MG PRN  \nAmlodipine 10 mg daily  \n\n \nDischarge Medications:\n1. acetaminophen 500 mg Tablet Sig: ___ Tablets PO Q6H (every 6 \nhours) as needed for pain.  \n2. isosorbide mononitrate 60 mg Tablet Extended Release 24 hr \nSig: One (1) Tablet Extended Release 24 hr PO DAILY (Daily).\nDisp:*30 Tablet Extended Release 24 hr(s)* Refills:*2*\n3. docusate sodium 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO BID (2 \ntimes a day).\nDisp:*60 Capsule(s)* Refills:*2*\n4. insulin NPH & regular human 100 unit\/mL (70-30) Suspension \nSig: Five (5) 25 units Subcutaneous twice a day.  \n5. furosemide 40 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day.  \n6. warfarin 2.5 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO daily or as \ndirected.  \n7. metoprolol succinate 100 mg Tablet Extended Release 24 hr \nSig: Two (2) Tablet Extended Release 24 hr PO once a day.  \n8. lisinopril 5 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO once a day.  \n9. aspirin 81 mg Tablet, Delayed Release (E.C.)

Most likely due to decreased tube feeds and possibly \ninsensible losses with resolving PNA. Hypokalemia likely related \nto appropriate aldosterone release. Her TBW deficit on admission \nwas 3.2L, which was corrected with free water flushes via G tube \nover 2 days. Hypokalemia improved with po supplementation, and \nshe did not have EKG changes. \n\n#Leukocytosis: Patient also presented with leukocytosis with WBC \n20K. This was felt to be due to resolving PNA with an element of \nhemoconcentration. After free water flushes, her WBC improved to \n14 at discharge. CXR showed resolving PNA from prior CXR during \nadmission for PNA (___). Urine cultures were negative, \nand blood cultures were pending at time of discharge. CDiff was \nsent due to loose stool on admission but was negative.\n\n#Atrial fibrillation: Hospital course was complicated by afib \nwith RVR, which improved with increased home metoprolol po to 50 \nmg q6h and with IV metoprolol pushes during RVR episodes.  Of \nnote, patient has a high CHADS-VASC score, but per OMR during \nrecent goals of care discussion, anticoagulation is not within \nfamily's goals of care and was felt to be too high risk in this \npatient with prior hemorrhagic stroke.\n\n#H\/o prior hemorrhagic CVAs: non-verbal, quadriplegic at \nbaseline. Patient seen by wound team for recommendations (see \nworksheet for recommendation). \n\n___: Patient's creatinine on admission was 1.4, which is higher \nthan a baseline around 1 but improved from a discharge \ncreatinine of 1.9 from last admission. Her new baseline is \nunclear currently, as she was thought to have possible ATN in \nsetting of septic shock during prior admission.\n\nCHRONIC ISSUES:\n#CAD complicated by recent type 2 NSTEMI: started aspirin and \nstatin this admission for secondary prevention\n\n#Epilepsy: continued home keppra. \n\n#COPD: continued home ipratropium nebs\n\n#HTN: held home amlodipine throughout admission and at discharge \ndue to BPs around 140 and because metoprolol dose was increased. \nAmlodipine may be restarted if indicated.\n\n#H\/o constipation: continued home docusate, bisacodyl, milk of \nmagnesia, polyethylene glycol\n\n#NSTEMI on prior admission: EKG this admission without ST \nchanges. Continued metoprolol as above, and started aspirin 81 \nmg this admission as well.\n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES: \n- Please ensure adequate free water flushes, as hypovolemia is \nthe most likely explanation for abnormal labs; we recommend \n250ml H20 q4h\n- Check chem7 within 1 week of discharge\n- Home amlodipine discontinued during admission and on discharge \ngiven BPs in 140s \n- Home Lasix held throughout admission and at discharge given \nhypovolemia.

He \nreceived high dose Melphalan prior to his transplant. The \npatient became appropriately neutropenic and his ANC>500 on \n___. The patient was given GM-CSF and switched to G-CSF \nbecause he was possibly having fevers related to the GM-CSF. \nDuring his stem cell transplant, the patient required total \nparenteral nutrition because he was not able to tolerate PO \nsince he had severe abdominal pain and nausea. The patient's \nabdominal pain was controlled with a Morphine PCA. The patient \nhad watery, brown diarrhea and was found to be C. diff negative \nx 3. A CT of the abdomen showed typhlitis with colonic wall \nthickening in the proximal and transverse colon. The patient was \nstarted on broad spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin, cefepime, and \nflagyl) and micafungin for neutropenic fever and typhlitis. The \npatient's blood and urine cultures did not show any source. As \nthe patient's counts recovered, he was continued on flagyl and \ncipro to treat his typhlitis.\n\nOn discharge, the patient was given a dose of aerosolized \npentamidine (___). He was started on acyclovir and \nfluconazole for prophylaxis.\n\nGout: The patient has a history of gout and used prednisone and \nallopurinol as prophylaxis prior to his transplant. Normally, he \nuses colchicine. All of his gout medications were stopped during \nhis transplant. As his ANC recovered, the patient developed more \njoint pain in his hands and also right ankle. Clinically, the \narea was not erythematous and the patient described it as his \ntypical gout pain. The patient prescribed high dose prednisone \nat 40 mg for three days and then was asked to take 30 mg the day \nafter discharge and then to go to 20 mg after that. The patient \nwas able to ambulate on discharge.\n\nTyphlitis: The patient was diagnosed with typhlitis. He was \nstarted on the aforementioned antibiotics and as his counts \nimproved, his abdominal pain improved. He had acute worsening of \nthe abdominal pain and a CT of the abdomen\/pelvis was performed \nagain which showed improved typhlitis. He was continued on \nCipro\/Flagyl for 7 days post-discharge.\n\nChronic pain: The patient has a history of chronic pain and \npresented on MS ___ and Morphine. He was unable to tolerate \nPO and he was switched to a Morphine PCA. On discontinuation of \nthe PCA, the patient expressed that his previous pain regimen \nwas not fully controlling his pain. He was started on a fentanyl \npatch with oxycodone breakthrough. The patient was given one \nmonth worth of patches and 30 oxycodone pills. The patient's \npain was controlled for 1.5 days on this pain regimen.\n\nAnxiety\/Depression: When the patient was unable to tolerate PO, \nthe patient was taking ativan for his anxiety instead of \nclonazepam. On discharge, the patient was not given a \nprescription for ativan, however, he requested 30 pills of \nClonazepam\n\nPeripheral neuropathy: The patient has a history of peripheral \nneuropathy and prior to his transplant was taking Neurontin.

CT abdomen&pelvis \nrevealed a high-grade small bowel obstruction with a transition \npoint in the right lower quadrant.  The patient was admitted to \nthe Acute Care Surgery service and, given the findings, was \ntaken to the Operating Room where she underwent Enterolysis.  \nThere were no acute events in the Operating Room (reader, please \nsee Operative report for details).  The patient was transferred \nto the PACU and, once stable, was transferred to the surgical \nfloor for further monitoring.   \n\nOn POD1, the patient self d\/c'd her NGT.  She was started on IV \nlopressor for elevated systolic blood pressure. On POD2, her \nfoley catheter was removed and a urinalysis was sent for \ncomplaints of dysuria.  No urinary tract infection was apparent \non UA or from the urine culture and she remained afebrile and \nher dysuria resolved. \n\nOn POD3, the patient was triggered for systolic blood pressure \ngreater than 200 and she was Enaliprat and hydralazine was \nincreased. On POD4, the patient reported increased abdominal \npain and a chest x-ray and CT abd&pelvis were ordered. Findings \nrevealed no bowel obstruction or evidence of ischemia but did \nshow b\/l small to moderate pleural effusions associated with \natelectasis.  The patient was encouraged to use her incentive \nspirometer and ambulate.\n\nOn POD5, the patient was started on sips which were \nwell-tolerated. Losartan and home aspirin were started. She was \nadministered a fleets and soap suds enema and was disimpacted \nwith good effect. As the patient reported low abdominal pain, a \nUA and UCx were ordered which showed no apparent infection. The \npatient reported this pain greatly improved after having a bowel \nmovement. \n\nOn POD6, the patient was advanced to a regular diet which was \nwell-tolerated.  All IV blood pressure medications were \ndiscontinued and her home carvedilol was started. Blood \npressures were well-controlled. On POD7, the patient was started \non her home Isosorbide.  The patient's systolic blood pressure \ndecreased to the ___ and 110s which she initially tolerated, but \nthen became acutely symptomatic with complaints of dizziness.  a \n1L LR bolus was administered with good effect and her systolic \nblood pressure increased to the 130s. The patient was kept in \nthe hospital for an additional day for further monitoring. The \npatient and her daughter were instructed to hold the patient's \nisosorbide until her follow-up appointment with her PCP.  She \nwas also instructed to check her blood pressure at home and to \nseek medical attention if her hypertension was not controlled. \n\nThe patient was alert and oriented throughout hospitalization; \npain was initially managed with IV pain medication and then \ntransitioned to oral pain medication once tolerating a diet. \n\nThe patient remained stable from a pulmonary standpoint; vital \nsigns were routinely monitored. Good pulmonary toilet, early \nambulation and incentive spirometry were encouraged throughout \nhospitalization. The patient's intake and output were closely \nmonitored.  The patient's fever curves were closely watched for \nsigns of infection, of which there were none.\n\nThe patient's blood counts were closely watched for signs of \nbleeding, of which there were none. The patient received \nsubcutaneous heparin and ___ dyne boots were used during this \nstay and was encouraged to get up and ambulate as early as \npossible.\n\nAt the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile \nand hemodynamically stable.  The patient was tolerating a diet, \nambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well \ncontrolled. She was having soft, formed bowel movements. The \npatient received discharge teaching and follow-up instructions \nwith understanding verbalized and agreement with the discharge \nplan.

Compared \nto the \nprevious tracing of ___ the rate is slower. \n\nCXR ___\nIMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic process though the \ncostophrenic angles \nwere partially excluded. \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nPatient is a ___ homeless man with history of EtOH abuse, \nmyocardial infarction, cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation (not \non coumadin), hypertension, hepatitis B and C, who presented in \nthe ED complaining of left-sided chest pain, and became \ntremulous. \n.\nACTIVE ISSUES:\n# Chest pain: history suggestive of ACS (substernal chest pain, \nleft arm pain), but ECG showed no acute ischemic changes and TnT \nwas <0.01 x3. Pneumonia was unlikiely given the lack of fevers \nand CXR with no infiltrates. Most likely etiology is \ncostocondritis; resolved in the ED.\n.\n# Alcohol withdrawal: In the ED patient became agitated, \ndiaphoretic, and increasingly tachycardic. CXR was unremarkable. \nHe was given 3mg ativan, 15mg of diazepam for CIWA>10, and was \ntransferred to the MICU for management of alcohol withdrawal. He \nreceived B12 and Folic Acid. In the MICU he was afebrile, \nhypertensive to 161\/100, tachycardic to 114, and was somewhat \ntremulous and diaphoretic.  He was placed on Diazepam 5 mg PO \nQ1H:PRN for CIWA > 14. He was otherwise comfortable and stable, \nno longer reported any chest pain, and was speaking in full \nsentences, and was alert and oriented to person, place, and \ndate.  He was restarted on his home metoprolol and diltiazem \ndose, and was started on B12, folic acid, and thiamine.  The \nnext morning the patient was requiring less diazepam  (5mg \nq4H:PRN for CIWA>14) and was no longer tachycardic, \nhypertensive, tremulous or diaphoretic. He was therefore \ntransferred to the floor. On the floor he was initially \ncomfortable and stable, and his diazepam requirement decreased \nto 5mg q8H: PRN for CIWA>10. Social work was consulted given \nfrequent admissions for alcohol abuse. However, on the morning \nof ___ he was dissatisfied with his lunch and became \nagitated. Despite receiving 2 doses of 5mg diazepam q2H, he \ncontinued to be agitated and abusive to nursing staff, and \nstated in no uncertain terms that he wanted to leave.  The risks \nof leaving while undergoing treatment for alcohol withdrawal \nwere explained to the patient, including seizures and death; \nhowever, he insisted on leaving and left the hospital against \nmedical advice. \n.\n# Tachycardia (sinus): unresponsive to IV fluids in ED. Likely \ndue to EtOH withdrawal. Patient was placed on telemetry; home \nmetoprolol, diltiazem were continued; he received maintenance IV \nfluids at 100cc\/hr and Diazepam for EtOH withdrawal (as per \nabove).\n.\nINACTIVE ISSUES\n# Hypokalemia: admission K 2.7, possibly due to long-standing \nalcoholism accompanied by vomiting and diarrhea, as well as this \npatient's use of HCTZ and furosemide. K was trended daily and \nrepleted as necessary.\n.\n# Anemia, thrombocytopenia: Hct was stable in low 30___. Iron \nstudies (___) had shown Iron 203, TIBC 239, Transferrin 184, \nferritin 278, B12 407, folate 15.6. Plt 102, which is \napproximately at the patient's baseline. Both anemia and \nthrombocytopenia are likely due to alcohol-induced bone marrow \nsuppression, though on this admission B12 was wnl (308). CBC was \nmonitored; thiamine, folate were given daily.\n.\n#. Back pain: chronic for about ___ no surgical intervention \nper neurosurg (see last d\/c sum). Pain was controlled with \nlidocaine patches.\n.\n#. Hepatitis B\/C: alcoholic pattern. Has h\/o grade 3 fibrosis. \nOutpatient management was recommended.  \n.  \n#. Atrial fibrillation: not on coumadin due to risks with \nhomelessness. Patient reports receiving prior cardioversion. ECG \nis sinus here.  \n- Continue metoprolol and diltiazem  \n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES\nNone - patient left AMA.\n \nMedications on Admission:\nOne Multivitamin by mouth daily\nToprol XL: one 25mg tablet by mouth daily\nOmeprazole: one 20mg tablet by mouth daily\nHCTZ: one 50 mg tablet by mouth daily\nFolic Acid: one 1mg tablet by mouth daily\nVitamin B1: one 100mg tablet by mouth daily\nDiltiazem XR: one 120mg tablet by mouth daily\nFurosemide: one 20mg tablet tablet by mouth daily\n\n \nDischarge Medications:\n1. multivitamin     Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily). \n \n2. folic acid 1 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).  \n\n3. metoprolol succinate 25 mg Tablet Extended Release 24 hr Sig: \nOne (1) Tablet Extended Release 24 hr PO DAILY (Daily).  \n4. omeprazole 20 mg Capsule, Delayed Release(E.C.)

Patient transfused with 4U pRBCs and IVF, and initially \nrequired Phenylephrine. Over the course of her FICU admission, \nher pressor requirement resolved, lactate normalized to 1.8, and \nCBC remained stable. \n\n#Afib with RVR: During ICU course, pt was persistently \ntachycardic, thought to be related to afib and recent surgery \n(home rate control held). She initially required esmolol gtt for \nrate control but was ultimately transitioned to PO metoprolol. \nShe was transferred to the medicine floor for ongoing rate \ncontrol. She was ultimately uptitrated to metoprolol 200xL and \ndiltiazem 120ER wtih successful rate control. Her apixaban was \nrestarted 9.1.\n\n# Recent Hip replacement revision: Patient has history of hip \nfracture s\/p hemiarthroplasty prosthesis that initially failed. \nThis was converted to a total hip and then to a longer stem type \nof implant. Initially, she had done well, but then presented \nback with large hematoma in setting of chronic anticoagulation \nfor Afib. During surgery, hematoma was noted to be quite \nextensive, involving nearly her entire proximal ___ of her \nthigh. This was extensively debrided and closed. She is s\/p  \nfascia iliaca catheter and incisional wound vac. She was seen by \n___ who advised rehab. She will be discharged to rehab with a \nwound vac and will be scheduled for orthopedic follow up\n\n# Acute blood loss\n# Anemia\nAcute loss in the setting of evacuation of hematoma. Per report \nshe lost 1L of blood during surgery and received a total of 4 \nunits pRBCs, 5L IVF in the ICU. Blood pressures stable. H\/H with \nslow downtrend in the subsequent days on the medicine floor \nrequiring another blood transfusion Reticulocytes increased, no \nclear evidence\nof iron deficiency, and likely component of anemia of chronic \ndisease. \n\n# Risk of infection while wound draining\nKeflex is a new medication to treat pt's risk of infection while \nher hip wound is still draining that was recommended by \northopedics.

Both kidneys are echogenic, \nparticularly left kidney. There is no hydronephrosis of either \nkidney. On the right, there is a 2.4 cm simple cyst of the \nlateral upper pole. No renal calculi are present. The urinary \nbladder is moderately well distended, without abnormalities.\n \nIMPRESSION:\n1. No hydronephrosis of either kidney.\n2. Bilateral increased renal parenchymal echogenicity and left \nrenal atrophy, consistent with history of chronic renal disease.\n3. Simple right renal cyst.\n\nNEEDLE RENAL BIOPSY ___: \nCrescentic glomerulonephritis with low level IgG deposition in \nthe setting of hydralazine use and P-ANCA positivity, see note.\n\nNote:\nLight Microscopy: The specimen consists of renal cortex, but is \npredominantly medulla, containing approximately 4 glomeruli, of \nwhich 0 are globally sclerotic.  One shows a cellular crescent, \nthe remainder are essentially within normal limits.\n.\nThere is widespread interstitial edema and mild-moderate \ninterstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy.  Mild chronic \ninflammation accompanies the scarring.  Intact \ntubulo-interstitium show mild mononuclear inflammation, frequent \nred cell casts, and occasional interstitial hemorrhage.  Tubules \nshow acute injury, as well as proliferative changes.\n.\nArteries show moderate intimal fibroplasia.\n.\nArterioles show moderate mural thickening and hyaline change. No \nvasculitis is noted.\n.\nImmunofluorescence:  The specimen consists of renal cortex, \ncontaining approximately 4 glomeruli, of which 1 is globally \nsclerotic.  There is granular mesangial staining for IgG (1+), \nIgM (0-trace), C3 (1+), Kappa (1+), and Lambda (trace-1+).  \nTrace C1q is seen in vessels.  One glomerulus shows segmental \nfibrin positivity. 1+C3 is seen along tubular basement membranes \nand in vessels. Tubular basement membranes show no IgG \ndeposition.\n.\nAlbumin is non-contributory.\n.\nElectron microscopy:  Findings will be issued in an addendum.\n.\nComment:\n1.  Cortical sample size is limited.\n2.  The amount of immune complex deposition noted is consistent \nwith a pauci-immune process (here most likely hydralazine \nrelated), but does raise the possibility of a second, immune \ncomplex related process. Interestingly, hydralazine is also \nassociated with drug induced lupus like syndrome.  \nUltrastructural studies will be helpful.\n.\nClinical: Chronic renal disease likely due to HTN, on \nhydralazine for many years.  Unilateral renal artery stenosis.  \nPresents with anemia and ARF (SCr from mid 1's to 3.3).  U Pr\/Cr \n= 0.3.  P-ANCA positive.\n.\nGross: Received are needle core(s) of light brown tissue.  The \nspecimen is viewed in the dissecting microscope, identified as \nrenal by Dr. ___, and divided into material for light \n(formalin fixation) and electron microscopy and \nimmunofluorescence studies.\n.\nPAS and ___ stains were done to evaluate basement membranes - \nMasson's trichrome stains were done to evaluate interstitial \nfibrosis. \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ yo F with RAS, baseline CKD III, pAF, HTN presenting with \nacute on chronic renal failure who was found to have + P-ANCA \npossibly related to hydralizine.\n.  \n# Renal failure: Baseline GFR is 30 with Cr 1.6 and pt was last \nseen in ___. She presented to her nephrologist for \nroutine visit with no acute complaints, except for fatigue that \nhas been ongoing. Her Cr was checked was elevated to 3.3. She \nwas admitted for further evaluation. Calc FENA was 1.4 with \nUOSMS of 431 at admission, not particularly suggestive of \npre-renal physiology. Renal US shows no hydronephrosis, or \nbladder retention. Pt was producing adequate amounts of urine. \nSediment analysis reveled blood which was initially thought to \nbe related partially to ___ supratherapeutic INR. The urine also \nhad abnormal RBC morphology, no casts were seen. Lisinopril, \nhydralazine and sotalol were all stopped at admission due to \npoor renal function. She was given fluids with mild decrease in \nCreatine from 3.3->3.0 which she has stayed stable for the last \nfew days. She has been producing adequate amounts of urine \noutput. The serology returned positive for P-ANCA which is very \nsuggestive of inflammatory process, vasculitis GN. This was \nthought to be related to hydralazine.  Her renal biopsy was done \non ___ pt tolerated the procedure well with no \ncomplications. Post biopsy she was started on solumedrol 250mg x \n2 days, once the prelimary pathology report confirmed \npauci-immune glomerulo nephritis she was given 500mg of \nsolumedrol x 1 day. She was then started on prednisone 50mg PO \ndaily until she is further evaluated by nephrologist. Her \ncreatine remained stable at 3.0, but it did not decreased. The \nfinal renal biopsy shows 1+C3 along tubular basement membranes \nand in vessels. Tubular basement membranes show no IgG \ndeposition. The amount of immune complex deposition noted is \nconsistent with a pauci-immune process (here most likely \nhydralazine related), but does raise the possibility of a \nsecond, immune complex related process. Interestingly, \nhydralazine is also associated with drug induced lupus like \nsyndrome. Other labs such ___ and ANTI-HISTONE ANTIBODY were \nalso positive.  \n.\nShe was then started on prednisone 50mg PO daily and on \ncyclophosphamide 75mg daily on the day of discharge. She should \ncontinue these meds until she is further evaluated by \nnephrologist. She will need close follow-up and will need \nmonitoring of her CBC, electrolytes and creatine. She should not \nbe placed on hydralazine and caution should be used when using \nother medications that can also cause pauci-immune \nglomerulonephritis such as: propylthiouracil, allopurinol, \npenicillamine, minocycline. Pt overall states to be feeling much \nbetter by time of discharge her fatigue and poor appetite had \nimproved. \n.\n# paroxysmal AFIB: Patient was on sotalol for ___ years prior to \nadmission and this was D\/ced at admission due to \ncontra-indicated in pt's with GFR<10. Will continue to hold \nsotalol for now. Started on low dose metoprolol 12.5mg BID as \nrecommended by renal since unable to start other meds. On the \nday prior to discharge pt had an episode of A-fib with RVR with \nHR in the 120s she was given an additional dose of metoprolol PO \nwith good effect her HR decreased to 8os, she remained in A-fib. \nHer dose of metoprolol was increased to 25mg BID and her HR has \nremained stable in the ___. Her coumadin was initially \nstopped due to supratherapeutic INR and it continued to be held \nfor the renal biopsy, as recommended by nephrology her coumadin \nshould be held for total of 7 post renal biopsy due to the risk \nof bleeding. She was instructed to start taking her home dose of \ncoumadin on ___. I also spoke to Dr. ___ \noutpatient cardiologist, who she will be following up in 1 week \nand who manages her coumadin. She is scheduled to have ___ \ndrawn on ___ and to have results sent to Dr. ___. \n.  \n# Weight loss: per her report, seems to be undergoing a firly \nthorough evaluation as an outpt which until now has been notable \nfor some pancreatic lesions (info not in our system). She had a \ncolonoscopy and EGD in ___ that were negative, except for \npolyps that were biopsied and overall benign. While hospitalized \nshe had nutrition consult. She was given nutritional shakes with \nmeals. As per patient, her appetite had overall improved and she \nwas eating mod-large amounts of her meals. This may be due to \nremoval of hydralazine that was making her fell sick and the \nlarge doses of steroid that she received. Her fatigue had also \nimproved. She will need to continue to be closely monitor.  \n.  \n# Anemia: Likely ___ CKD. Iron studies not consistant with iron \ndeficiency or anemia of chronic disease. This is likely due to \nrenal failure and decrease epo. Hct sl lower than baseline of \nmid to low ___. Currently trending down at 29->26.8. No signs of \nbleeding. She will need to continue to have Hct monitored.\n.  \n# HTN: Pt had lisinopril and hydralazine held due to renal \nfailure. Her BP was slightly elevated with SBP in 160s-180s, her \ndose of amlodipine was increased from 5mg to 10mg and she was \nstarted on metoprolol as noted above. She was sent home on \nmetoprolol XL 50mg daily. Her BP was well controlled with SBP in \n130s. She will have close follow-up with her primary care \nprovider, nephrologist and cardiologist within the next ___ \nweeks.\n. \n# HyperK: Patient's K at admission was 5.6 with no changes in \nthe EKG. This was likely related to renal failure. She was given \nkayexalate and she was placed in low K diet. Her K remained WNL \nduring the rest of her hospitalization. \n. \n# FEN: She was initially given increase amounts of fluids which \nwas then stopped, regular diet (low Na, low K)  \n.  \n# Prophylaxis:  \n-DVT ppx: heparin SQ, given that she is off coumadin for renal \nbiopsy \n-Bowel regimen  \n-___ consult: pt ambulating independently in the halls\n.  \n# Access: peripherals  \n# Code: full  \n# Communication: Patient and her son ___\n.\n# ___: home with ___, I spoke to her son and \ndaughter-in-law who were trying to arrange for her to have \ncompany on the weekend post discharge.\n \nMedications on Admission:\nsotalol 80mg bid  \nhydralazine 25 tid  \nlisinopril 20 daily  \nnorvasc 5 daily  \nco-e Q  \ncoumadin 4mg 5x\/wk, 2mg 2x\/wk  \n \nDischarge Medications:\n1.

Three vessel coronary artery \ndisease. 2. Patent LIMA-LAD. 3. Successful PCI of the LCX\/OM \nwith drug-eluting stent.\n\n___ CXR: Asymmetric CHF. An underlying infectious infiltrate \nin the right lower lung cannot be excluded. \n\n___ TTE: The left atrium is normal in size. The left \nventricular cavity size is normal. There is moderate regional \nleft ventricular systolic dysfunction with basal to mid \ninferolateral and inferior akinesis. Views are suboptimal so \nregional wall motion could not be fully assessed. Right \nventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The \naortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no \naortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. \nThe mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. An eccentric, \nposteriorly directed jet of at least moderate (2+) mitral \nregurgitation is seen. Mitral regurgitation is not fully \nvisualized. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. \nThere is no pericardial effusion.  \n\n___ CT chest: 1. Moderate, mostly loculated, right pleural \neffusion and small, dependent freely layering left pleural \neffusion. 2. Dense opacity at right lung base adjacent to \npleural effusion likely \nrepresents atelectasis and less likely focal infection. 3. \nBilateral ground-glass opacities with septal thickening and \nbronchial wall \nthickening likely represent hydrostatic edema, but viral \npneumonia may \nproduce a similar pattern. 4. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy with \nthe largest lymph node conglomerate located subcarinally. \nAlthough potentially related to hydrostatic edema or infection, \ngiven the large size of the subcarinal lymph nodes, there is \nconcern for malignancy. Followup CT in 6 weeks after treatment \nof the patients acute conditoin is recommended. 5. Two nodular \nfoci in the right upper lobe may represent focal areas of \ninfection and less likely malignant lung nodules. These may also \nbe reassessed at the follow up CT scan. 6. Small amoung of \nascites is noted. Hypodense lesion in the upper pole of the left \nkidney likely represents a cyst. \n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ with MMP presents with VT storm and ICD firing, transferred \nfrom outside hospital for EP ablation.\n.  \n# Ventricular Tachycardia: \nPatient presented from outside hospital with VT storm, initially \nthought to be of ischemic etiology due to scar tissue. TSH and \ndigoxin level were within normal limits.  Patient had been \nloaded on amiodarone at outside hospital and was continued on \namiodarone drip at 0.5mg\/hr and beta blocker on presentation to \n___. On the night of admission, patient had frequent runs of \nNSVT, longest 15 beats, which started while he was sleeping.  \nWhile awake, patient reported feeling a sensation of \"warmth\" \nduring some of these runs of NSVT. He was started on low dose \nmetoprolol (both patient and daughter do not recall reason for \nlisted atenolol allergy) and amiodarone drip dose was increased \nto 1mg\/hr, after which frequency of NSVT runs decreased quickly. \nDuring attempted EP ablation of VT tract the next morning, \nElectrophysiology team was able to map out patient's left \nventricle and felt that VT was coming from right ventricle.  \nPatient reported having chest pain during EP procedure, so the \nprocedure was cut short, and patient was sent for Cardiac \nCatheterization with the presumption that his VT may have been \nof ischemic etiology. The patient had a PCI of the LCX\/OM with \ndrug-eluting stent, however, felt that this wasn't in the right \nlocation to be causing his VT. The patient had no further runs \nof VT and no further EP procedure was done. If he develops VT in \nthe future he may need his right ventricle mapped to look for a \nfocus of the VT. The patient will follow up with Dr. ___ as \nan outpatient.\n\n# Shortness of Breath: \nPatient experienced worsening shortness of breath during \nhospitalization, likely multifactorial.  He presented with two \nweeks of worsening productive cough and was treated for Right \nlower lobe pneumonia with broad spectrum antibiotics; only \nnormal oropharyngeal flora grew from his sputum culture.  \nPatient appears to have long history of hospitalizations for \nCOPD and CHF exacerbations with prolonged courses of recovery. \nHe was found to have a right sided pleural effusion on admission \nto ___ he was noted to have had this effusion in the past \nwhich was previously drained and found to be transudative.  \nEffusion appeared to be loculated on lateral decubitus films \ntaken during this hospitalization.  Patient's O2 requirement \nincreased post EP and Cath procedures.  He was thought to have \naspirated during the EP procedure, so flagyl was added to his \nantibiotic regimen.  Pulmonary embolism was considered but felt \nto be of low suspicion.  Lower extremity ultrasound was negative \nfor DVTs bilaterally. Ultimately, he was treated for COPD \nexacerbation with steroids, despite minimal wheezing on exam, \nafter which his symptoms improved. He was discharged home with \nservices on oxygen (which he had prior to this hospitalization).\n\n# COPD Exacerbation: \nPatient has prior smoking history, intermittently requires O2 at \nhome, usually with CHF exacerbations.  He has had multiple known \nexacerbations for CHF and COPD in the past with prolonged \nrecovery. His oxygen requirement was variable with up to 6L NC \nand a face tent. He was started on IV methylprednisolone and \nthen prednisone taper. His oxygen requirement decreased to 4L \nNC. He will follow up with his PCP ___ discharge for further \nmanagement. He was discharged with Advair.\n\n# Coronary Artery Disease: \nPatient was ruled out for MI at the outside hospital, and EKG \nwas without evidence of acute ischemia. Patient was continued on \nhome aspirin, statin, plavix, and beta blocker. Patient was sent \nto Cath lab immediately after having chest pain in the EP lab.  \nCardiac Catheterization showed three vessel coronary artery \ndisease, 100% stenosis of mid LAD but patent LIMA-LAD graft, and \nsignificant disease in the Left Circumflex.  The left circumflex \nhad 90% proximal stenosis before the origin of the AV branch and \nan 80% stenosis after the AV and before OM1, and was totally \noccluded distally.  A Drug-eluting stent was placed in the \nproximal-mid Circumflex. The \nSVG-PDA and SVG-OM were known occluded and were not looked at.  \nA femoral bruit was noted post procedure, not known to be old, \nbut femoral ultrasound showed no pseudoaneurysm or fistula.  \nPatient did have a couple of episodes of chest pain in the day \npost catheterization with no EKG changes; he noted that the \nchest pain was similar to pain he experiences at home sometimes \nfor which he does nothing.\n\n# Hypertension: \nBlood pressure was well controlled during hospitalization.  He \nwas discharged on his home low dose of tamsulosin, metoprolol. \nHe will follow up with his primary care physician for further \nmanagement.\n\n# Hyperlipidemia: \nHe was continued on Zetia\/Simvastatin.\n\n# Afib: Well rate controlled, currently A paced. On no \nanticoagulation although CHADS score is 6. He was continued on \naspirin and plavix.\n\n# CRI: At baseline 1.7. He was given mucomyst prior to cardiac \ncatheterization.\n\n# Diabetes:\nPatient was continued on basal glargine plus an insulin sliding \nscale during this hospitalization.  His blood sugars were \nelevated while on steroids for COPD exacerbation. \n\n# BPH: \nHe was continued on his home meds.\n\n \nMedications on Admission:\nLisinopril 2.5mg PO daily\nLasix 40mg PO QOD (last on ___\nKCl 10mEq QOD \nLantus 30U qhs\nNovolog 10U TID \nProscar 5mg PO daily\nFlomax 0.4mg PO daily\nParoxetine 30mg PO daily\nPlavix 75mg Po daily\nDigoxin 0.125mg Po daily\nASA 81mg PO daily\nZetia 10mg PO daily\nSimvastatin 20mg PO daily\nOmeprazole 20mg PO daily\nAmiodarone 400mg PO daily\nColace 100mg PO daily\nSenna 8.6mg Po at bedtime \nAmbien 5mg Po qhs prn\n \nDischarge Medications:\n1.

No left atrial \nmass\/thrombus seen (best excluded by transesophageal \nechocardiography). The right atrium is moderately dilated. The \nestimated right atrial pressure is ___ mmHg. There is mild \nsymmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size \nand global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal \ntechnical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be \nfully excluded. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall \nmotion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, \nascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets \nare mildly thickened (?#). There is mild aortic valve stenosis \n(valve area 1.6cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The \nmitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No masses or \nvegetations are seen on the mitral valve, but cannot be fully \nexcluded due to suboptimal image quality. An eccentric, \ninferolaterally directed jet of moderate (2+) mitral \nregurgitation is seen. Due to the eccentric nature of the \nregurgitant jet, its severity may be significantly \nunderestimated (Coanda effect). Tricuspid regurgitation is \npresent but cannot be quantified. The estimated pulmonary artery \nsystolic pressure is normal. There is an anterior space which \nmost likely represents a prominent fat pad. \n\nIMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Eccentric jet of moderate \nmitral regurgitatio with mildly thickened leaflets.Mild \nsymmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved regional \nand global biventricular systolic function. Mild aortic \nstenosis. \n\nCompared with the prior TTE study (images reviewed) of \n___, the severity of mitral regurgitation is increased, \nbut compared with the TEE of ___, the severity of mitral \nregurgitation is similar. \nNo discrete vegetation identified, but given the eccentric \nnature of the mitral regurgitation, a TEE is suggested if the \nsuspicion for endocarditis is moderate or high. \n\n___ CXR:\nIMPRESSION: \n  \nMild pulmonary vascular congestion.

A list of patient's issues are below. \n\nAcute Issues:\n==============\n# Bacteremia: Patient received multiple studies to identify \nsource of bacteremia including UA, CXR, and joint synovial fluid \nanalysis all of which were not concerning for infectious source. \nPatient had a PICC line, which was removed on admission. Patient \npresented with very poor dentition. Dental was consulted and \nmade recommendations regarding tooth extraction. ID and \nsensitivities returned Klebsiella ESBL and the patient was \nchanged from Zosyn to Meropenem on ___.  Meropenem will be \nswitched to Ertepenem upon discharge and patient is to complete \na 14 day course of Meropenem\/Ertepenem.\n \n#Infected teeth: dental was consulted while patient in house and \npatient taken to OR on ___ and 9 teeth were extracted. \nProcedure was uncomplicated. Dental team had the following \nrecommendations: Amoxicillin for 1 week, no nose blowing for 1 \nweek, pseudoephedrine PRN nasal congestion for one week, nasal \nspray PRN for 1  week, no incentive spirometry postoperatively, \nno straws, sinus precautions, and soft diet for 1 week.\n\n# Recent MRSA bactermia\/Left septic hip\/osteomyelitis: patient \nhas a prolonged history of persistent MRSA left hip septic \narthritis and osteomyelitis since ___ with recent \nantibiotic discontinuation admitted on ___ with evidence of \nsepsis secondary to relapsed. Vancomycin was discontinued on \n___ after cultures were negative for gram positive \norganisms. Patient's hip was evaluated with CT scans during \nadmission and found to not be worsening. Dressing changed and \npacking of open wound were done daily by nursing staff.\n\n# Altered mental status: On the night of ___ the patient \ntriggered for altered mental status likely secondary to narcotic \noverdose. He was receiving MS ___ as well as dilaudid for \npain. His mental status improved slightly with Narcan and \nresolved over the course of the day. Sedating pain medications \nwere minimized and his mental status remained clear.\n\n# Metabolic alkalosis (bicarb 36). Resolved without \nintervention. Patient was likely chronic CO2 retaining secondary \nto asbestosis and body habitus. Bicarb early in admission was in \nlow ___. Possible acute respiratory acidosis secondary to \ndecreased narcotics with metabolic compensation.\n\nChronic Issues:\n================\n# Afib: CHADS2 score is 4 for which patient continued warfarin. \nBecause of the interaction with amiodarone and elevated INR upon \nadmission, patient's warfarin dose was titrated to 4mg daily \nwhich he will be discharged on. Patient continued metoprolol for \nrate control. Patient's amiodarone and digoxin were discontinued \nduring hospitalization because there were not effective in \nmaintaining sinus rhythm.  Furthermore, pt's digoxin level was \nsignificantly elevated on admission with concern for possible \nconduction blocks intermittently on telemetry. Patient will need \nfrequent INR checks once discharged.\n\n# Coronary artery disease: patient continued aspirin, \natorvasatatin, Imdur, metoprolol, lisinopril.  \n \n# Diabetes mellitus complicated by neuropathy: patient continued \nGabapentin 300 mg PO Q8H, insulin sliding scale and a diabetic \ndiet\n.\n# RA\/Adrenal insufficiency: patient continued prednisone 20mg PO \ndaily and Bactrim DS BID which according to infectious disease \npatient will need to continue for life.\n.\n# Asbestosis: patient continued on 3L O2 and Albuterol prn \n\n# Gout: patient continued on Allopurinol \n\n# ? CHF: TTE repeated in house, EF 55-60%.  Lasix discontinued \nas patient did not require this medicine in house to maintain \neuvolemia.

Consider fibroscan or \nfurther workup as an outpatient.\n\nMICU Course\n===========\nPresented after a fall. Evaluated by neurosurgery on arrival who \ndid not recommend surgical intervention. He was initially \nadmitted to the MICU for labs concerning for hypercarbic \nrespiratory failure. He was also hypotensive requiring levo fed \nbriefly. The Levophed was quickly weaned off. He was never \nintubated or put on BiPAP for his respiratory failure. His blood \npressures were persistently in the ___ systolic. He was \nmentating appropriately, with a normal lactate. This is assumed \nto be his baseline. He is s\/p prednisone burst for presumed COPD \nexacerbation ___ s\/p azithromycin 500mg x 3 days \n(___)\n\nWhile in the MICU, he was found to have tachy-brady syndrome. \nElectrophysiology, cardiac surgery, and interventional radiology \nwere all consulted. There was an attempted pacemaker placement \nfor his tachy-brady syndrome on ___ via an attempted \nR-femoral venous access. However, the pacemaker was not \nsuccessfully placed due to difficult vascular access. The \npatient was then transferred to the cardiology floor while \nawaiting multidisciplinary discussion between electrophysiology, \ncardiac surgery, vascular surgery, interventional radiology with \na approach as to how best to implant the pacemaker.\n\nFLOOR COURSE\n============\nOn the floor, there were continued discussion regarding how best \nto place a pacemaker. Consulting teams requested the operative \nreports of his prior surgeries so as to better understand his \nanatomy, however these unfortunately could not be obtained as it \nwas unknown where he had had these surgeries. Consulting teams \ncontinued to discuss best approach for providing patient a \npacemaker, with a tentative plan for access through his tunneled \nline or possible epicardial leads. He continued to be \ntachycardic to the 110s, as well as hypotensive to SBPs ___. \nHe triggered on the floor multiple times for unstable vitals, \nhowever continued to mentate well, and had normal lactate on \neach check. His respiratory status remained stable on his ___ \nbaseline NC requirement. Nephrology attempted perform HD while \non the floor, however patient could only tolerate 1 hr of \ndialysis due to significant hypotension. They stated they would \nnot pursue further dialysis on the floor given his hypotension. \nOn ___, patient began to have episodes of very symptomatic \nbradycardia lasting ___ minutes. He would temporarily lose \nconsciousness, have HRs in the ___, and then spontaneously \nreturn to his baseline tachycardia and mental status. He had \nmultiple episodes of this on the floor over the night, with the \nlast episode requiring a few seconds of transcutaneous pacing. \nThis prompted his transfer to the CCU. Patient's floor course \nwas also complicated by significant pain requiring breakthrough \noxycodone, as well as significant anxiety, which seemed to \nworsen his symptoms. \n\nCCU COURSE \n==========\nIn the CCU, patient was monitored while awaiting pacemaker \nplacement and continued to have several episodes of slow atrial \nfibrillation associated with episodes of presyncope. Through \ncombined efforts by ___ and EP, patient underwent ___ procedure on \n___ to establish venous access through the R groin into the IVC \nwith plan to undergo Micra pacemaker placement on ___. During \nthis procedure, ___ performed angioplasty of the R external iliac \nwhich was found to be occluded ___ scarring from prior access of \nthis vein. A dialysis catheter was placed as a placeholder to \nmaintain vascular access for pacemaker placement. During this \nprocedure, patient require both levophed and vasopressin to \nmaintain adequate BPs in setting of anesthesia. The patient \nremained intubated after this procedure and was maintained on \ntwo pressors while sedated. On ___, he had a permanent \npacemaker placed and remained intubated since his procedure \noccurred late. He was successfully extubated in the AM of ___. \nHe was weaned off vasopressin and levophed before transfer to \nthe floor. He was followed by Nephrology for HD. Of note, \npatient continued to have significant anxiety that was acutely \nexacerbated by his bradycardic episodes in which patient feels \nhe's about to die. Palliative care was consulted to help assist \nwith management of patient's pain and anxiety. He was deemed \nclinically stable for floor transfer.\n\n___ COURSE\n============\nPatient was transferred to the Cardiology service for further \nmanagement after CCU course.

His injuries included: hemoperitoneum, right ___ \nrib fractures, comminuted right sacral fracture, left distal \nfibula fracture, left medial maleolus fracture, and left ___ \nmetatarsal fractures. He was initially admitted to the trauma \nICU and underwent the following course:\n\n___: Hemodynamically stable except for elevated blood pressure \nup to SPB 190-200 which was managed by IV hydralazine, tender \nabdomen and pelvis controlled on current pain meds, Phenobarb \nprotocol for Etoh withdrawal. Got left radial A-line. NPO \n@midnight for OR tomorrow for ORIF APC2 fx, EUA of left \nankle\/foot. \n\n___: OR w\/ ortho for anterior pelvic fixation, L ankle \nfixation, EBL 100cc. AM Hct 23.9 (<-24.2<-25.2) 2PM Hct 24.2. \nActivity: touchdown weightbearing B\/L ___, needs wheelchair. \nGiven additional 20 IV hydral postop for HTN SBP 230->190. Given \nlabetalol 10 IV x1, SBP 150s. DCD hydralazine, switched to 5 IV \nlabetalol q4. Cefazolin 3 doses periop. DCD intermittent \ndilaudid IV, started dPCA. A line DCD.\n\nThe patient was then transferred to the floor on hospital day 3. \nHe was maintained on a phenobarbital CIWA protocol to prevent \nalcohol withdrawal. His blood pressure continued to be treated \nwith IV hydralazine as needed but improved relative to while in \nthe TSICU. His hematocrit dropped to 20 and he was transfused 1U \nPRBC with stable hematocrit after. He was hemodynamically stable \nand did not require subsequent tranfusion, with repeat CT \nimaging at the time showing no increase in size of \nhemoperitoneum or active bleeding. The patient initially did \nwell after transfer to the floor and tolerated regular diet, \nhowever then developed an ileus with increasing abdominal \ndistension and failure to pass flatus. KUB showed markedly \ndilated colon to 8.8cm. He received a dulcolax suppository and \npassed flatus\/BM several days after onset of ileus. Physical \nexam showed improvement of abdominal distension, corroborated by \nserial KUBs showing resolving distension. His diet was advanced \nsequentially to regular which he tolerated well. \n\nAdditionally, the patient suffered from urinary retention with \nfailure to void after repeat foley removal attempts. He was \nstarted on flomax and subsequently voided appropriately after \nfoley removal for the remainder of his hospital course. On ___ \nhe was found to have ecoli in his urine and started on a 5 day \ncourse macrobid. On ___ he was seen and evaluated by \nhematology for thrombocytosis and chronic microcytic anemia \nwhich was determined to be most likely reactive. They \nrecommended iron supplements and outpatient follow up to \ndetermine if he requires Hgb electrophoresis. \n\nPsychology was consulted to assess the patient for capacity to \nmake decisions. They determined he does not have the capacity to \nleave against medical advice. The patient and his health care \nproxy ultimately agreed to be discharged to a rehab facility. \nThey recommended continuing olanzapine for delirium and weaning \nas tolerated. \n\nHe was seen and evaluated by physical therapy who recommended \ndischarge to rehabilitation center.

No fever, \ntachycardida, or leukocytosis. He was given 2 days of \nceftriaxone for presumed UTI, but UCx was negative, so \nceftriaxone was stopped, and the patient remained afebrile and \nhemodynamically stable. He was also anemic to 6.4 on admission \n(baseline Hgb ~7), and received 2 pRBC transfusions on ___ and \n___. His mental status was determined to be at baseline by his \nwife. Because he was having urinary incontinence and had a \nhistory of multiple myeloma, an MRI L-spine was obtained to rule \nout cord compression, which showed spinal canal narrowing at \nL4-5 without signs of cord compression. Ortho spine determined \nthat no surgical intervention was indicated and that \nincontinence was not likely to be due to spinal canal narrowing. \nThe patient was determined to be stable to return home, where he \nlives with his wife.\n\n# Urinary incontinence: Patient has report of urinary \nincontinence and increased frequency.

Per ortho spine, incontinence was likely \nnot secondary to spinal canal narrowing; no surgical \nintervention required. \n\n#Altered mental status: Patient AOX1-2 on exam, though may be \nmore related to word-finding difficulty than to confusion. Per \nhis wife's report, this may be close to his baseline. No other \nfocal neurological deficit on exam. NCHCT without acute process. \nHydroxyzine was held in the setting of altered mental status.\n\n# Multiple myeloma: Unfortunately refractory and relapsed after \nauto HSCT ___. Patient currently on Carlfizomib, C3D2 being \nheld in the setting of infection. IgG 3546 on admission and free \nkappa >60K. Extremely high paraprotein has been approximately in \nthis range since ___ of this year. Outpatient Oncologist \nwell aware and considering pheresis as an outpatient. Unclear if \npatient's depressed mental status, urinary incontinence, stool \nincontinence on admission related to remarkably high paraprotein \nlevels. Light chain deposition disease a consideration, but more \ntypically affects heart, kidneys. \n\n#Anemia: 6.4 on admission; likely secondary to ESRD and multiple \nmyeloma; patient appears near his baseline, though this \nfluctuates.

He and his girlfriend provide an\nexcellent history. \n\nThe patient was last normal on ___ evening and recalls\nawakening on ___ around 5:15 AM in the morning feeling\n\"dizzy\" which he further clarified as feeling as if the \"room \nwas\nspinning\". He could not specify a particular direction. He\nendorses that this dizziness was worse on walking and on\nexertion. During this episode he also felt nauseaous, warm and\nthen developed a gradual left sided total body numbness that did\nnot originate in any particular part of the body. The patient \nwas\nable to recall that this numbness started in one minute of the\nonset of dizziness and lasted about ___ minutes. He also\nnoticed that within 5 minutes of the beginning of dizziness his\nspeech became slurred and lasted about 30 seconds as well. He\ndescribed a novocaine like sensation in his tongue. Upon arrival\nof the ambulance about 20 minutes later, he had felt the \nsymptoms\nbegin to resolve however he still endorsed significant \nexhaustion\nand the new onset of a left sided occipital headache that he\nrated as a ___. He endorsed this headache as a throbbing pain\nthat was localized only to the occipital region on the left and\ndid not radiate. Upon arrival to OSH about 45 minutes later he\nstill endorsed feeling dizzy with a continuation of the headache\npain. \n\nA CT scan was done and found to be negative for intracranial\nlesions and the patient was admitted for observation and further\nwork up. His pain was treated symptomatically. Initially, he\ncould not tolerate MR imaging due to anxiety. MR imaging the \nnext\nday without contrast and with a low dose of ativan came back\nnormal, and the neurologist on staff was consulted and concluded\nthere was no evidence of stroke on imaging. He also received an\nechocardiogram and ultrasound of the left side of his neck\n(versus carotid U\/s? the records are not with us); this returned\nnormal. He was sent home and instructed that he could take\naspirin for headaches. Later that evening the patient endorsed\nfeeling normal and did not have any recurrence of his symptoms.\nThis continued on into ___ when he was able to return to\nwork and functioned in his usual manner. He reiterates that he\nfelt well on ___ (yesterday) and wanted to be with his\ncolleagues at work. \n\nOn ___ morning at 8:30AM, the day of presentation, the \npatient\nwoke up about at  15 minutes later than he had intended to make\nit to work on time and began quickly preparing himself for the\nday. Within 15 minutes, the patient noticed the onset of the \nsame\nsymptoms he had in his initial episode just 3 days prior. He\nfirst recalls being dizzy as if the room were spinning around in\nno particular direction and then feeling numbness on the left\nside of his body. Again he could not recall whether this started\nin a specific focus but endorsed a total numbness of the left\nside. He endorsed blurry vision but could not specify as to \nwhich\npart of the vision field was affected. His girlfriend who was\nwith him at the time endorses that he also had evidence of \nfacial\ndrooping on the left side, slurred speech, and difficulty\nswallowing. Again these events were followed by a left sided\nocciptial headache that came on sooner, about 5 minutes after \nhis\ninitial set of symptoms. This episode lasted 15 mintues until \nthe\nparamedics were able to arrive on the scene. Upon examination,\nparamedics reported a left-sided arm drift. He was then taken to\n___ where the symptoms regressed save for a\nleft-sided nystagmus noted on exam and left sided ptosis. He\nreceived zofran, toradol and reglan initially to no avail. His\nheadache persisted and so he received a dose of DHE. His\nmagnesium was low and so he was given a dose of MgSO4, and sent\nhere for a neurological evaluation. \n\nUpon interview today, the patient endorses the same left\nsided-occipital headache rated at about ___ that comes and \ngoes.\nHe has been taking almost daily ibuprofen several times a day\nsince that event, for headaches in that area. He endorses\nsleeping in a unusual position about three weeks ago on the \ncouch\nand feels that these headaches started around the same time as\nthis incident. He also endorses that he has been having much\ndifficulty with sleep recently predominantly charecterized with\ntrouble staying asleep. He attributes this to anxiety and\nendorses a lot of stress recently due to multiple factors such \nas\nnot having health insurance and financial concerns. He also\nrecalls skipping meals often in the same time frame.

His symptoms \ninitially resolved after the first episode but recurred on the \nmorning of presentation (___). The patient presented to \n___, where he was also noted to have a left \nptosis and left nystagmus on leftward gaze. There, he received \nzofran, toradol, reglan, and DHE, but his symptoms persisted. He \nwas given supplemental magnesium sulfate for low magnesium and \ntransferred to ___ for further management. \nAt ___, the patient's images and results from ___ were \nreviewed by the Neurology team and showed no abnormalities. \nAdditionally, a CTA Head\/Neck was obtained. 3D reconstruction of \nhis neck vessel imaging showed a ___ area suspicious of a left \nvertebral artery dissection with pseudoaneurysm, which was \nconfirmed by fat-suppressed MRI imaging. His symptoms were \nlikely due to a transient ischemic attack from that dissection. \nHe improved clinically throughout the hospital course, but \ncomplained about intermittent headache.\n\nHe was discharged on aspirine 325mg as an antiplatelet agent, \nand we instructed him to go to an emergency room should his \nsymptoms with nausea and vertigo reoccur.\nAt this point we do not see an indication for anticoagulation \nwith warfarin, but will discuss this should he become \nsymptomatic again in the future.\n\nHe was started on nortriptyline 10mg qHS as a headache \nprevention, but also for insomnia and anxiety, which he \ncomplained about while being hospitalized.\nWe instructed him to treat his acute headaches with tylenol \nq6hrs for five days, and to call our office should they not \nsubside.\n\nHe will be followed in our Neurology clinic.\n \nMedications on Admission:\nnone\n \nDischarge Medications:\n1.

Pneumothorax was confirmed on chest CT at the \noutside hospital and reconfirmed at ___. Thoracic Surgery \nevaluated the patient and noted that surgical intervention was \nunnecessary at that time. The patient's pneumothorax remained \nstable on serial chest xrays and the patient's dyspnea improved \nwith oxygen and management of his COPD\/emphysema.\n.\n# COPD \/ EMPHYSEMA: The patient was continued on his home \nregimen of inhaled fluticasone two times daily and \nalbuterol-ipratropium nebulizers every six hours. For \nbreakthrough dyspnea, an additional albuterol nebulizer could be \nadministered every three hours as needed. The patient was weaned \nfrom 4L oxygen upon arrival to his home dose of 2L oxygen upon \ndischarge. When admitted, the patient was on 30 mg prednisone \ndaily that had been started to manage a COPD flare prior to this \nadmission. This was tapered to 20 mg prednisone daily by \ndischarge. The patient was given detailed instructions on how to \ncontinue the taper and this will be managed while he is an \noutpatient. Both saline and fluticasone nasal spray were \nadministered to manage the patient's post nasal drip, with \nmoderate effect. \n.\n# ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: Patient had known atrial fibrillation \nmanaged with digoxin, verapamil and warfarin and had \nreappearance of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular \nresponse in the ___ ED. This was likely triggered by his acute \npulmonary process -- the pneumothorax and possible COPD flare -- \nwith possible contribution from missing doses of his digoxin and \nverapamil prior to admission. The patient's cardiac markers were \nnegative x2 and his most recent TSH was within normal limits \nmaking hyperthyroidism an unlikely cause for atrial \nfibrillation. The patient was maintained on 480 mg\/day total of \noral verapamil, but dosing changed from twice daily to three \ntimes daily dosing to maintain more constant systemic levels of \ndrug. The patient's digoxin was decreased from 0.25 mg to 0.125 \nmg daily given a borderline elevated serum digoxin level. \nTelemetry showed that the patient remained in atrial \nfibrillation but was rate controlled between 85-100 BPM. The \npatient was found to be subtherapeutic on his initial warfarin \ndose of 1 mg (INR of 1.1 on admission) and his warfarin was \nincreased to 5mg by discharge. His INRs will be monitored as an \noutpatient by his primary care physician.\n.\n# URINARY RETENTION: The patient has a benign prostatic \nhyperplasia and was maintained on his home regimen of tamsulosin \n(Flomax) and finasteride. He had a history of a Foley catheter \nin place for 2.5 weeks total, removed only 1 week PTA. He \npresented without a Foley catheter in place and had just \ncompleted a course of ciprofloxacin as prescribed by his \nurologist, but initial urinalysis showed positive nitrites, WBCs \nand many bacteria; however urine cultures did not grow out any \npredominant species. A Foley catheter was placed in the ___ ED \nfor patient comfort as patient complained of urinary urgency, \nfrequency, and straining. Because of concern for UTI, the \npatient underwent several Foley removal \/ voiding trials. \nHowever, post void residual bladder scans showed retention of \nbetween 500-600cc each time and the Foley catheter was replaced \nand remained in place upon discharge. The patient will be \nevaluated by his urologist as an outpatient for further \nmanagement of his urinary retention; an appointment has been \nscheduled.\n. \n# CONSTIPATION: The patient's constipation was likely secondary \nto a combination of decreased mobility and the high doses of \nverapamil needed to manage his atrial fibrillation. As \nconstipation was a likely contributor to the patient's urinary \nretention, he was placed on an aggressive bowel regimen \nincluding Senna, Dulcolax, polyethylene glycol, psyllium \n(Metamucil), and Colace (bisacodyl), with soap suds enema as \nneeded. \n.\n# NUTRITION: The patient's regular diet was supplemented with \ncalcium and vitamin D to treat likely decreased bone density \nsecondary to the patient's current steroid course. \n \nMedications on Admission:\nEnteric coated Aspirin 81 mg daily\nDigoxin 0.25 mg daily\nFinasteride 5 mg daily\nOmeprazole 20 mg daily\nWarfarin 1 mg daily\nPrednisone 10 mg TID\nSenna 2 tablets daily PRN \nAtivan 0.5 mg daily\nFlomax 0.4 mg daily \nFlovent BID (dose unknown)\nFluticasone (Flonase) nasal spray 50 mcg.\nHome oxygen 2L\nDulcolax 5mg daily as needed for constipation\nCiprofloxacin 500 mg twice daily x6 days (had just completed \nprior to admission)\n \nDischarge Medications:\n1.

Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. \nCompared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, the \nrhythm is now atrial fibrillation and the estimated PA systolic \npressure is lower (previously overestimated and 30mmHg + RA on \nreview of the prior study).\n\nCardiac Catheterization- Final report unavailable.  No \nobstructing lesions noted.  No intervention performed. \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n#  Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure:  Patient was \nrecently admitted for acute on chronic CHF exacerbation with \nsimilar symptoms.  ECHO on admission showed \"normal \nbiventricular cavity sizes with preserved global and regional \nbiventricular systolic function, mild pulmonary artery systolic \nhypertension.\"  During her last visit, her home dose of lasix \nwas increased to 40mg daily.  Her symptoms returned and she was \nadmitted for diuresis.  She was started on 40mg IV lasix BID and \nit was increased to 60mg IV BID after monitoring her diuresis \nand renal function.  She diuresed well with improved in lower \nextremity edema and shortness of breath.  She never required \noxygen while here.  She was transitioned to 80mg PO lasix daily \non discharge.  Discharge weight was 85.8kg.   \n  \n#  Atrial fibrillation- Patient rate and rhythm controlled with \namiodarone 200mg daily and metoprolol 200mg PO BID.  She was \nstarted on digoxin on prior hospitalization at 0.125mg daily.  \nIt was discontinued here given her diastolic dysfunction.  She \nremained in atrial fibrillation initially.  It is thought that \nher atrial fibrillation is triggering her acute on chronic CHF \nexacerbations.  Given that, she underwent cardioversion on ___ \n(metoprolol held for procedure but resumed afterward at prior \ndose).  She remained in sinus rhythm initially with frequent \nPVCs but eventually went back into atrial fibrillation.  She was \nmaintained on coumadin while here until it was decided to send \nher to catheterization (INR was 3.1).  Coumadin was held from \n___ until ___.  It was resumed at home dose (2mg \n___, 4mg ___ after cath (INR was 1.4).  She was \ndischarged with 3 day course of lovenox at 120mg\/.8ml once per \nday (estimated creatinine clearance calculated to be 36, so it \ndid not need to be renally-dosed).  Patient to have INR checked \non ___ with results to be faxed to ___'s office.  \n  \n#  Chest pain- Patient describes chest pain of 1 day duration.  \nDescribed as a tightness located near her sternum- denies any \npressure, radiation or syncope.  She was ruled out for MI and \ndid not experience any chest pain during the remainder of her \nhospitalization.  Given her risk factors and recurrent CHF \nexacerbations, she underwent catheterization on ___.  She was \ngiven mucomyst pre-cath.  Cath showed 70% lesion at diagonal and \n60-70% lesion at OM.  There was no intervention performed.  She \nwas continued on daily aspirin and statin.  Upon discharge, she \nwas hemodynamically stable and asymptomatic.\n \n#  CKD- On admission, creatinine was 1.9.  Her baseline Cr is \n1.3-1.5.  It was monitored closely given that patient was being \ndiuresed.  She returned to her normal range.  She maintained \ngood urine output while here and responded very well to lasix.  \nUpon discharge, her electrolytes were within normal limits and \nher creatinine was 1.5.  \n\n#  HTN- She was continued on her home regimen except we \nsubstitute valsartan for avapro given formulary status of \navapro.  Patient's blood pressures remained under good control \nwhile here.  Avapro was resumed on discharge.\n\n#  Foot pain- patient experience bilateral vague foot pain while \nhere.  Patient described it as a sharp pain that was worse with \npalpation.  She was initially unable to even stand up given the \nseverity of the pain.  She does not have history of diabetes and \nsugars were within normal limits.  Her electrolytes were within \nnormal limits.  On examination there were no \nlesions\/ulcerations\/erythema noted on exam.  She had full ROM \nand sensation was intact and symmetric bilaterally.  Pain was \nlocated all over her feet (plantar, dorsum).  She does have a \ndiagnosis of plantar fascitis in the past.  Podiatry was \nconsulted.  They believed the foot pain was secondary to \ndeconditioning which caused scar contraction.  They recommended \nambulation as treatment as it was loosen up the tissue and \nimprove the pain.  We were limited to tylenol and tramadol for \npain given issues with age (for narcotics, amitriptyline) and \nrenal status (for NSAIDs).  Patient worked well with physical \ntherapy daily.  We discussed going to rehab but the patient \nrefused rehab so she was sent home with physical therapy \nservices.  Her foot pain had improved daily and she was able to \nambulate on discharge.  \n  \n# Hypothyroid- continued on home dose of levothyroxin\n\n# FEN:  regular diet- heart healthy\/2gm sodium \n \n \nMedications on Admission:\n1.

Noticeable \nimprovement in the sigmoid colon with loss of vasculature (25 \ncm). Cold forceps biopsies were performed for histology at the \nsigmoid colon (25 cm). Cold forceps biopsies were performed for \nhistology at the rectum (10 cm). \n\nFlexible Sigmoidoscopy (___)\nSegmental erythema, granularity and abnormal vascularity were \nnoted in the rectum and sigmoid colon. There was a 20 mm linear \nulcer and several small ulcers in the distal rectum. Overall, \nthe inflammation appeared to be improved endoscopically.\n\n=============\nOTHER STUDIES\n=============\n\nColonic Mucosal Biopsies (___)\n1. Colon at 25 cm:\n- Chronic mildly active colitis.\n- A CMV immunostain is negative, with adequate controls.\n2. Colon at 10 cm:\n- Chronic moderately active colitis.\n- A CMV immunostain is negative, with adequate controls.\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nMs. ___ was admitted to the hospital for a moderate UC flare: \n2 weeks of hematochezia (>8 bloody stools daily) and severe \nabdominal pain without systemtic symptoms suggestive of a \nmoderate UC flare. Sigmoidoscopy (___) with proctitis. Complete \nstool studies and CMV were negative. She had poor response to 3 \ndays IV steroids (persistent symptoms, slight elevation in CRP) \nand no change on repeat sigmoidoscopy (___). Biologic therapy \nwith infliximab was initated and resulted in marked improvement \nof symptoms: only 1 formed stool, non-bloody stool in last 24 \nhours, no abdominal pain, no nausea. She was discharged on a \nprednisone taper and will continue with infliximab injections as \ndirected by her outpatient GI.\n\n# Ulcerative Colitis Flare: Patient presented with abdominal \npain and hematochezia over the course of 2 weeks in the setting \nof having discontinued medication ~10 months prior and \ndiscontinuation of regimented diet 6 months prior. Most \nconsistent with UC flare given prior dx and recent non-adherence \nto diet and medication. Over 10 bloody stools a day with severe \nabdominal pain. No systemic symptoms. Current presentation \nconsistent with Moderate flare. GI consulted and patient \ninitated on IV methylprednisolone therapy. Sigmoidoscopy \nrevealed granularity, erythema, friability and loss of \nvasculature in the rectum compatible with proctitis (biopsy, \nbiopsy). Patient had continued bloody BMs and abdomnial pain \ndespite >48 hrs of IV therapy. Repeat sigmoidoscopy revealed \nerythema, granularity and abnormal vascularity in the rectum and \nsigmoid colon compatible with colitis. Given her lack of \nclinical and pathologic improvement, patient initated on \ninfliximab therapy. Significant improvement in symptoms was seen \nby the next hospital day. The patient was converted to oral \nprednisone to be tapered as an outpatient and scheduled \ninfusions to be set up with gastroenterology.\n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES\n- Dicharged on prednisone taper \n- Started on infliximab infusions. Will plan for additional \ninfusions at 2 and 6 weeks.

Given your previous diagnosis of ulcerative colitis (UC), these symptoms were most likely the result of a UC flare. While you were in the hospital we performed an imaging study of your colon (flexible sigmoidoscopy) which showed inflammation of the lower portion of your colon (proctitis) consistent with UC. We treated you with steroids but your symptoms did not improve as we had hoped. At this point we began treatment with infliximab (Remicade) which you tolerated well and led to a marked improvement in your symptoms. You will be discharged on prednisone and also continue to receive infliximab. The single most importatnt thing you can do to prevent future episodes is to regularly take the medication prescibed to you by your gastroenterologists. This is critical even when you are feeling well. You should receive a phone call from Dr. ___ to schedule your next infusion of infliximab."}

Patient has some \nrisk for resistent bacteria given that she works at a rehab \nfacility but she has no other risk factors so will require \ntreatment only for CAP.  The patient had a CTA chest performed \nto rule out thromboembolic disease.  No venous thromboembolism \nwas noted, but it did show a left lower lobe pneumonia with an \ninitial read of possible empyema.  Further radiologic review \nsuggested this was not the case, but the patient remained \nhospitalized for two nights for monitoring.  She did have a \nmoderate amount of pleuritic and musculoskeletal pain that was \nmanaged with scheduled tylenol.  Cough suppressants were given \nwith good effect.  The patient slowly improved clinically, \nleukocytosis resolved, and the patient was discharged two days \nafter admission.  She was initially treated with levofloxacin \nduring her course, but her insurance does not cover this \nantibiotic, so she was discharged with a 7 day course of \nazithromycin and cefpodoxime.  She will likely need follow up \nimaging to ensure clearance and if still positive or poor \nresponse to treatment may need repeat CT to ensure no empyema.\nShe was maintained on influenza precautions, as the results of \nher nasal swab were pending throughout her course.  She will \nwear a mask at home while symptomatic until instructed \notherwise.\n.  \n#. Pleuritic chest pain- PE already ruled out as above, unlikely \ncardiac given negative enzymes and EKG and most likely her PNA \nis causing pleurisy.  \n.  \n#. HTN: Atenolol was continued, patient was normotensive.  \n.  \n#. Anemia\/Fatigue: This seems to be a chronic problem for her \nlikely exacerbated by her new infection.  Anemia work up did not \nreveal overt iron-deficiency anemia.  Guaiac was negative.  TSH \nmildly elevated at 4.5.  Patient will discuss further evaluation \nwith her PCP.  It was thought that atenolol, which was recently \nstarted, may have been contributory.\n.\n#.

The \nspleen, both adrenals, both kidneys, pancreas are unremarkable. \nThe patient \nhas a PEG tube in place. There is a small amount of free fluid \nin the abdomen. \nThe small and large bowel loops are unremarkable. No fluid \ncollections are \nnoted. \n  \nCT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: The rectum, sigmoid colon, \nbladder and \nuterus are unremarkable. There is trace pelvic free fluid. No \npelvic or \ninguinal lymphadenopathy by CT size criteria is present. \n  \nOSSEOUS STRUCTURES: The visible osseous structures showed no \nsuspicious lytic \nor blastic lesions or fractures. \n  \nIMPRESSION:  \n1.

Left ventricular wall \nthickness, cavity size and regional\/global systolic function are \nnormal\/borderline hyperdynamic (LVEF >55%). The right \nventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall \ncontractility. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally \nnormal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis. No \nmasses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. Trace aortic \nregurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly \nthickened. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. \nMild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic \nshadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be \nsignificantly UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are \nmildly thickened. Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. \nThere is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. [In \nthe setting of at least moderate to severe tricuspid \nregurgitation, the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure \nmay be underestimated due to a very high right atrial pressure.] \nThere is a trivial\/physiologic pericardial effusion. \n\nIMPRESSION: No echocardiographic evidence of endocarditis or \nhemodynamically significant pericardial effusion. Normal left \nventricular cavity size and wall thickness with borderline \nhyperdynamic biventricular systolic function. Severe tricuspid \nregurgitation. Borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension \n(may be underestimated in the setting of severe tricuspid \nregurgitation). Small left pleural effusion. \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nFROM ___. ___ in the ICU\nICU COURSE:\n=====================================\nAssesment: This is a ___ year-old female with a history of \ndementia who was transfered from ___ in shock which \nwas later thought secondary to pneumonia, possibly aspiration. \nShe was successfully extubated on ___ and weaned off pressor \nsupport. She was transferred to the ward on ___ from the ICU. \n.  \n# Shock: Patient met SIRS criteria with temperature, \nleukocytosis and tachycardia. Likely source was unclear although \nthis was most likely septic shock due to pneumonia despite \nequivocal CXR. She did have a moderately positive UA on \nadmission with ___ WBC and moderate bacteria which latterl, but \nthere was no growth on urine culture.  Cardiogenic shock was \npossible given the elevated CE but unlikely to be associated \nwith a fever to 104.  CT-head and LP were unremarkable. The \npatient received Vancomycin and  Ceftriaxone at the OSH. Her \nlactate rose to 3.1 on ___ and this decreased to 2.0 on ___. She \nhad a central line and A-line inserted and her hemodynamics were \nclosely monitored. She was treated with IV broad spectrum abx in \nthe ICU with Vancomycin\/Cefepime\/Ciprofloxacin and later \ncontinued on cefepime and vancomycin. She had no further fevers \nand she required inoptropic support with norepinephrine for \nhypotension. She was sedated with fentanyl and midazolam. Her \nWBCs were elevated at 13.7 on admission and with therapy this \ntrended down to 9.2 on ___. She was weaned off inotropes and \nreceived IV fluid boluses to maintain her BP. Given a possible \ncardiac cause, she received aspirin and her cardiac enzymes were \ncycled and were stable at 0.26. Echo on ___ showed no evidence \nof endocarditis or pericardial effusion with normal LV size and \nwall thickness with borderline hyperdynamic biventricular \nsystolic function in the setting of severe TR. OSH cultures were \nfollowed; we contacted ___ ___ (___) when \nall cx were still negative, csf neg, wbc 6, rbc 1, 2 sets blood \ncultures neg, no urine cx. BP improved, she no longer required \nfrequent fluid boluses, and she was successfully extubated on \n___. She was transferred from the ICU on ___. She was treated \nwith vanco\/cefepime for HCAP, as we thought she lived in a \nfacility, but it turned out that she lived at home. She improved \nmarkedly so we decided to keep her on an 8 day course of this \nregimen via PICC line. Her code status was confirmed with her \nhusband as being DNR but ok to intubate only while here as means \nto transition her home as we are able. \n.  \n#. Respiratory Failure: Pt was intubated after she was found to \nhave agonal breathing and was not protecting her airway. Her CXR \ndid not show a clear infiltrate but she did have LLL collapse. \nThere was no fluid overload or other acute process that would \nexplain her respiratory failure although given her presentation \nit was felt that this may have been secondary to aspiration or \ncommunity-acquired pneumonia. Her respiratory difficulties were \nmore likely due to decreased consciousness from poor brain \nperfusion secondary to her shock. She was successfully extubated \non ___ and maintained her saturations on 40% O2 with her ABG \n7.44\/28\/113\/20. She was closer to baseline post-extubation and \nwas stable on transfer to the floor on ___.\n.\n#. ___: Pt had elevated ALT and AST with normal AP and \nTBili.  This does not appear to be an obstructive picture and \nlikely represents shock liver. Tox screen negative. LFTs trended \ndown. Final CT A\/P read for signs of chronic liver disease \ndemonstrated mottled enhancement of the liver which may be \nsecondary to congestion. \n \n#. Anemia: Pt Hct on admission was 30.7. Unclear what her \nbaseline is. No evidence of acute blood loss and likely \ncomponent of Fe deficiency and chronic inflammation in the \nsetting of sepsis. HCT trended, stable. No transfusion \nrequirement. Maintained active T&S. Hemolysis labs negative.\n\n# Code status: Her code status was confirmed with her husband as \nbeing DNR but ok to intubate only while here as means to \ntransition her home as we are able.\n\n============================================================\nSINCE ARRIVAL TO THE FLOOR ON ___:\n.\nMs. ___ is a ___ y\/o F with PMhx of Dementia and \nquestion of ___ who was found unresponsive at home.  She \npresented to ___ in septic shock and was transferred \nto the ___ for further management. Of note, at ___, she had \nan LP to rule out meningitis (gram stain negative, WBC 5, RBC 6, \nprotein 47 and glucose 107).  She was started on pressors as \nwell as decadron, CTX and Vanco.  \n.\nIn the ICU here, she was treated with Vanc\/Cefepime for possible \nHAP (it was initially thought that she resided in a nursing \nhome).  She was extubated on ___ in the afternoon and \ncontinued to show clinical improvement.  Her course has been \nnotable for: NSTEMI with elevated troponins in the setting of \nseptic shock, with unremarkable EKGs, as well as radiographic \nevidence of LLL collapse.  A PICC line was placed for IV \nantibiotics and a family meeting was held (per documentation by \nDr. ___ and the family wishes to take Ms. ___ home \nwhen medically stable for ongoing care.  Her antibiotics were \ncontinued through ___.\n.\nOn the morning of ___, she was noted to have some myoclonic \njerking, leg jerking, eye fluttering.  Neurology was consulted \nand they felt these movements were likely in the setting of \nsevere metabolic disturbance and infection. Though seizures were \nunlikely, an EEG was ordered, and it showed diffuse\nencephalopathic changes of a moderate to moderately severe \nnature. It is suggestive, by virtue of the triphasic appearance, \nthat this is probably metabolic although it could be easily \nmetabolic associated with diffuse degenerative disease. No clear \nseizure activity was identified.\n.\nRepeat CXR on ___ confirmed ongoing LLL collapse.  It is \npossible that this this will improve with chest ___ and increased \naeration of the lungs. While this is most likely secondary to \nthe presumed pneumonia, the possibility of an underlying \nmalignancy was raised and discussed with the ___ son ___.  \n___ overall functional status is poor and performing a \nbronchoscopy would not be a trivial matter. Repeat CXR on \n___ was relatively unchanged, and we recommend another \nrepeat CXR in ___ weeks to confirm re-expansion of the LLL.\n\nLastly, her G-tube clogged several times in the last week of her \nhospitalization, each time responding to viokase +\/- bicarbonate \nper protocol. This was discussed with the ___ team, who \nrecommended changing her meds to liquid form when possible (the \nTylenol may very well have been clogging the tube) and \nincreasing her free water flushes. \n\nMs. ___ son ___ ___ was kept \nupdated throughout the hospitalization.\n\n \nMedications on Admission:\nunknown\n \nDischarge Medications:\n1. aspirin 81 mg Tablet, Chewable Sig: One (1) Tablet, Chewable \nPO DAILY (Daily).  \n2. docusate sodium 50 mg\/5 mL Liquid Sig: One (1)  PO BID (2 \ntimes a day).  \n3. senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a \nday) as needed for Constipation.  \n4. acetaminophen 500 mg\/5 mL Liquid Sig: ___  PO every six (6) \nhours as needed for pain.  \n5. metoprolol tartrate 25 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID \n(2 times a day).\nDisp:*60 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*\n6. acetaminophen 650 mg\/20.3 mL Solution Sig: One (1)  PO TID (3 \ntimes a day) as needed for pain.  \n\n \nDischarge Disposition:\nHome With Service\n \nFacility:\n___\n \nDischarge Diagnosis:\n## Septic shock attributed to community-acquired pneumonia\n## left lower lobe collapse: likely secondary to above infection \nbut need to rule out underlying mass\n## myoclonus of multifactorial etiology\n## hypoactive delirium of multifactorial etiology\n## Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation with borderline pulmonary \nartery systolic hypertension\n## Severe Dementia: fed through PEG Ttbe, lives at home with 24 \nhour caretaker and husband\n## ___, attributed to septic shock: resolved\n## acute kidney injury: resolved\n## NSTEMI in the setting of septic shock (Troponin peak 0.26)\n\n \nDischarge Condition:\nMental Status: Confused most of the time.\nLevel of Consciousness: Alert but not interactive.\nActivity Status: Bedbound.","summary":"You were admitted to the hospital with a very severe infection, low blood pressure and required special medication to help keep your blood pressure in a safe range.

We \nattempted to diurese pt with IV lasix bid and metolazone with \nminimal success as pt was unable to maintain a negative fluid \nbalance because of his ESRD.  Pt initially had a thoracentesis \nthat was negative for malignant cells.  Pt then had a CT-giuded \n___ biopsy on ___ which did confirm the presumed \ndiagnosis of malignancy.  Pt will be sent home on PO lasix 80 mg \nbid and metolazone 2.5 mg bid for symptomatic relief of dyspnea \nand orthopnea.  He will also continue albuterol nebulizer \ntreatments every 6h for dyspnea relief.\n\n# Acute on Chronic renal failure - pt p\/w Cr 5.9, worse than his \nbaseline.  His creatinine intially trended downward to a nadir \nof 4.7 before steadily rising to 5.5 on discharge. Discussion of \nhemodialysis had been brought up on last admission with renal \nand was briefly discussed after malignancy diagnosis, but pt was \nnot amenable to this plan.  Pt will be continued on sevelamir \n800 mg tid with meals and calcitriol 125 mcg daily. \n\n# Hypotension -  Pt was hypotensive on non-invasives on \nadmission, but had SBP's in 120's when an A-line was placed.  \nNon-invasive SBP's were persistently in the 90's and 100's \nthroughout the admission, likely representing the pt's baseline \nBP because of CHF.  Chest x-ray's did not show any sign of \npneumonia and pt was afebrile (pt with baseline leukocytosis).  \nHe also denies any cough or sputum production consitent with \nPNA.  Echo did not show any acute worsening of pump function.  \nPt dis not have any s\/s of sepsis (blood cultures were \nnegative).  Imdur and metoprolol were held during admission \nbecuase of low blood pressures.\n \n# Hyperkalemia - Pt had a persistently elevated potassium \ndespite recieving IV lasix bid.  It is possible that kidneys are \nnot able to excrete potassium because of a severely depressed \nGFR.  Pt recieved multiple doses of kayexalate to reduce \npotassium levels with minimal affectiveness.  He will be \ndischarged with daily kayexalate to reduce potassium levels and \nfor contibued constipation. He will also be discharged with \nzofran 4 mg q8h for nausea ___ the kayexalate.\n\n# Pleural effusion and multiple pulmonary nodules- Initial \npleural biopsy results were consistent with malignancy. \n  \n# Leukocytosis - Has had chronic WBC of ___ since ___ most \nlikely ___ lung malignancy.\n  \n# Anemia -  H&H has remained stable during admission around \n___. Does have history of severe bleed into renal cyst and \nwas recently on heparin, however no evidence of active bleed \nthroughout the admission\n  \n# Abdominal pain: Thought to be ___ fluid distention of abdomen \nor MSK in nature as CT scan from ___ showed no evidence for \nan acute process.  Pain was controlled during the admission with \noxycodone 5 mg q3h prn. \n  \n#Diabetes: Pt on insulin at home.  We adjusted his sliding scale \nfor persistent hypoglycemia in the am, as wel as decreasing his \nlantus to 7 units at bedtime.  He was also kept on a diabetic \ndiet.  \n \n#Hyperlipidemia: Pt was d\/c'd from rosuvastatin 20 mg daily on \ndischarge  \n  \n#Atrial fibrillation: Pt on amiodarone with AV pacing.  He will \nbe continued on amiodarone 200 mg daily for rhythm control.\n  \n# Hypothyroid: Pt will be continued on levothyroxine 125 mcg \n\/day for symptomatic relief.  \n  \n# Gout: not active but will continue with allopurinol to prevent \ngout flare.\n\n#Constipation:  Pt had issues with constipation during admission \nand will be discharged with docusate, senna, mirlalax and \nkayexalate.\n\n#CAD:  Pt will continue on aspirin 81 mg daily and SL nitro for \nrelief of chest pain.\n\nTransitional Issues:\n\n-Pt will be discharged to home hospice\n\n-Pt had code status changed to DNR\/DNI on discharge\n\n-Pt opted to have his BiVICD remain on at this time\n \nMedications on Admission:\n1. amiodarone 200 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY  \n(Daily).  \n2. calcitriol 0.25 mcg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO DAILY  \n(Daily).  \n3. omeprazole 20 mg Capsule, Delayed Release(E.C.)

No recent \ntravel, immobilization, family history of thrombophilia, \nsystemic signs or records of malignancy. He denied any recent \nseizures and falls since ___ where he would have been down \nfor a prolonged period. Thrombolysis was not indicated. He was \nstarted on a heparin drip. TTE showed pulmonary hypertension \nwithout classic RV strain (did note some mild RV dilation and \nabnormal septal motion). He was judged not to be a good \ncandidate for the newer oral anticoagulants given multiple AED \ndrug interactions. Neurosurgery was not concerned about \ntraumatic SAH 6 months ago. We transitioned him to a Lovenox \nbridge to coumadin (initiated on 6 mg given warfarin levels will \nbe lowered by phenytoin and phenobarbital). We weaned him off O2 \nand at the time of discharge he had no subjective dypsnea at \nrest or with exertion, ambulatory O2 sats ranged 88-95%. He did \nnot meet criteria for needing home O2. \n\nGiven the high risk of recurrent PE after first unprovoked PE, \nwe recommended that he would need indefinite anticoagulation. \nHis recent fall was due to a seizure, so this will depend on \nfuture assessment of fall risk. \n\n# Seizure disorder: His phenobarbital level was within \ntherapeutic range, but phenytoin was subtherapeutic - 1.8 and \n1.6 on repeat. We did not adjust his dose as it had been \nincreased recently in ___. Albumin level was normal. Free \nphenytoin was pending at discharge.

Paired brachial \narteries \nbilaterally with no evidence of calcification.  Diameters as \nnoted.  The upper extremity veins are as noted above. \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ y\/o woman with type 1 diabetes with multiple recent DKA \nadmissions and DM related complications and resultant stage V \nCKD, who was readmitted with worsening uremia and metabolic \nacidosis, nausea and vomiting who is now s\/p initiation of \ndialysis and s\/o placement of PD catheter. \n\n# Acute on CKD: Admission Cr 8.3 -> 8.8 from baseline in the 5s. \nRenal was consulted and initialy felt that the patient did not \nmeet criteria for urgent dialysis, but on ___ it was felt that \nshe would benefit from dialysis given electrolyte abnormalities \nand worsening metabolic acidosis. Patient's mental status \nremained stable without signs of uremia. On ___ a temporary \ndialysis catheter was placed as ___ did not feel comfortable \nsedating the patient due to continued vomiting. Patient recieved \ndialysis 4 times via temporary catheter. On ___ she was taken \nto the OR by transplant surgery for placement of a PD catheter. \nAdditionally, on ___, the temporary line was replaced with a \ntunneled catheter to facilitate dialysis while the PD catheter \nmatures. Electrolytes improved (see lab values for trends). \nPatient's Fe studies while in house were low normal, Hep \nserologies negative. PPD negative. At time of discharge, \nsymptoms of volume overload were resolved, as was metabolic \nacidosis. She will have outpatient dialysis via tunneled line \nuntil PD catheter matures, dressing over PD catheter should not \nbe disturbed until follow up with transplant surgery.\n  \n# SOB: The patient was initially significantly short of breath \nwith orthopnea, with crackles at bilateral lung bases. She \nrecieved lasix, with appropriate UOP. Her symptoms improved \nafter dialysis, and she was satting 98% on RA at time of \ndischarge. \n \n# Nausea\/vomiting\/gastroparesis: Patient presented with \nsignificant nausea and vomiting. This was felt to be partially \nrelated to uremia but likely multifactorial, given significant \nhistory of gastroparesis. During her stay, her nausea was \ndifficult to control, requiring a regimen of ativan, \npromethazine, zofran, and intermittent IM hydroxyzine. Her home \ndomperidone was held given that it is not FDA approved in the \nUS. Her nausea did begin to improve 2 days prior to discharge; \nwhen discharged she was taking good POs and nausea had resolved. \n \n\n# Metabolic acidosis with elevated anion gap: This was felt to \nbe consistent with uremia; not likely unknown ingestion given \nnegative urine and serum tox screens. Her acute on chronic \nkidney disease was managed as above. \n\n# Labile glucose: Patient has extensive history of complications \n___ DM1 (refer to PMHx) and history of labile blood sugars. \nTherefore, ___ consult recommended lantus 20U QHS and sliding \nscale insulin which helped with FSBG control.\n \n# Anemia: Hct 25 (baseline), consistent with anemia of CKD, and \npatient was asymptomatic throughout her hospital stay. Could \nconsider starting epogen as an outpatient. \n \n# Hypertension: Patient was moderately hypertensive \n150-170s\/80-90s. Her home amlodipine was contined at 10mg daily, \nand labetalol 100mg BID was uptitrated.

The patient completed 8 minutes of a Gervino protocol; ~ \n___\nMETS. Exercise was about to be stopped due to target workload \nbeing\nachieved, however at that point the patient began to report \nsymptoms and\na drop in systolic blood pressure was noted resulting in test\ntermination. At peak exercise, the patient reported an upper \nanterior\nchest discomfort along with a burning sensation in the throat \narea;\n___. The symptoms resovlved with rest and were absent 2 minutes \nand 45\nseconds post-exercise. No significant ST segment changes were \nnoted\nduring the procedure. The rhythm was sinus with rare isolated \nAPBs and\nVPBs. As noted above, a drop in systolic blood pressure was \nnoted at\npeak exercise. The heart rate response to exercise was blunted \nin the\npresence of beta blocker therapy and submaximal workload.\n \nIMPRESSION: Hypotensive blood pressure response with anginal \nsymptoms\nin the absence of ischemic ST segment changes. Nuclear report \nsent\nseparately.\n\nTTE ___\nThe left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is \nseen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure \nis ___ mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular \nhypertrophy with normal cavity size. Regional left ventricular \nwall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic \nfunction is low normal (Quantitative (3D) LVEF = 50 %). Tissue \nDoppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling \npressure (PCWP<12mmHg). There is no ventricular septal defect. \nRight ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. \nThe ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets \n(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No \naortic regurgitation is seen.

A stress test was done which showed no regions of vulnerable heart tissue but you did have chest pain and low blood pressures during the procedure and there was some concern that this was due to severe coronary artery disease. A catheterization (coronary angiography) of your heart was done which showed some no significant coronary artery disease. There was some concern that micro-vessel disease caused your initial symptoms. You kidney function was monitored by the primary team and our nephrologists. Your kidney function remained stable this hospital stay. You were kept in the hospital until your warfarin level (INR) was in the therapeutic range. The two days prior to discharge, you took 10mg and 10mg. Your INRs were 1.9 and 2.3. On the day of discharge, your INR is 2.8. You have not been given any warfarin on the day of discharge.

(injection)Given the bleeding in the mouth ENT was \nconsulted and found a small laceration at the lateral aspect of \nthe tongue that they treated that was likely secondary to trauma \nduring an intubation. This was not the source of bleeding. In \nthe duodenal bulb there was an area of hypertrophied mucosa that \nmay be consistent with brunners gland hyperplasia but biopsies \nwere not obtained in the setting of bleeding. Repeat endoscopy \nwith biopsies and careful evaluation at a later date is \nrecommended.Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum.\n.\nEGD ___:\nImpression:\nNormal mucosa in the esophagus\nNormal mucosa in the stomach\nNormal mucosa in the duodenum\nNo fresh or old blood was seen in the esophagus, stomach or \nduodenum\nUpon endoscopic evaluation of the oropharynx, there was a 2 cm \nclot-like material with overlying exudate which appeared \nadherent to the base of the tongue. This was mobile but could \nnot be removed. Nearby on the soft palate was a white pigmented \n1 cm lesion which also appeared compatible with a healing ulcer. \nThese lesions may potentially explain some of the upper tract \nbleeding which she had but will need further evaluation by ENT.\nOtherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum\nRecommendations:\n- No active bleeding was found and no source for esophageal, \ngastric or duodenal bleeding was present. Thus, lesion at base \nof tongue is suspicious for potential source of bleeding. A \ngastric dieulafoy's is still in the differential given bleeding \nseemed to stop during the prior EGD following epinephrine \ninjection into the fundus. \n- Recommend ENT evaluation for base of tongue lesion, soft \npalate ulcer, nasopharynx given patient complaint of sinusitis \nas well as laryngeal examination given patient's complaint of \nsore throat with still no clear source of upper tract bleeding.\n.\nCT Neck w\/ Contrast (___)\n1. 1.2 x 0.7 cm tongue base mass with peripheral calcification.  \nDifferential would include a malignant lesion of the oral \ncavity, though lack of local extension or adenopathy is noted \nsuggesting alternative diagnosis.  Minor salivary gland tumors \nsuch as adenoid cystic lesion should additionally be considered \nas well as mucoepidermoid carcinoma or adenocarcinoma. \n2. Enlarged thyroid gland without a focal nodule identified.  \nCorrelation with thyroid function tests recommended. \n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nPatient is a ___ with a history of CAD s\/p DES ___, \nhypertension, and reflux who presented with hematemesis. The \npatient was urgently intubated for airway protection and \ntransferred to the ICU. She initially underwent two EGDs without \na clear source of bleeding identified, though visualization was \nlimited due to frank blood in the stomach. Epinephrine was \ninjected into the fundus of the stomach out of concern for a \npossible Dieulafoy lesion. It was also noted that she had a \nlesion or laceration on the base of her tongue, originally \nthought to be from traumatic intubation\/extubation or scoping. \nHer bleeding stabilized spontaneously and she was extubated and \ntransferred to the general medicine floor. She had a third EGD \nonce on the floor which showed no signs of a bleeding source in \nthe esophagus, stomach, or duodenum. However, a lesion\/adherent \nclot was noted on the base of the tongue. ENT evaluated the \nlesion and requested a CT scan of the neck, which confirmed a \nmass but no local destruction\/invasion and no lymphadenopathy. \nENT then biopsied the lesion and the pathology results are \npending. It is notable that the patient has a 40+ pack-year \nsmoking history.\n\nAfter transfer to the floor the patient showed no other overt \nsigns of bleeding, had a rising HCT, and did not have melena. \nShe was continued on a PPI due to concern for an unseen GI \nsource for bleeding, and given her history of reflux.\n\nOther active issues:\n\nA RLL opacity concerning for pneumonia was noted on CT of the \nchest. She was treated with a 5 day course of levofloxacin.\n\nShe was incidentally noted to have an enlarged thyroid on CT of \nthe neck. Her TSH was checked and was normal at 0.97.\n\nChronic Issues:\n\nCAD\/HTN - aspirin, HCTZ, lisinopril, and atenolol were held \ninitially due to the concern for bleeding. Aspirin was restarted \non transfer to the general medicine floor. Atenolol and her \nantihypertensives were started the day prior to discharge.\n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\n[  ] patient will need a repeat EGD in 8 weeks, which our GI \ndepartment will arrange\n[  ] radiology recommended a repeat chest CTA in ___ weeks to \nevaluate an AVM and also to re-evaluate a 0.8 cm solid-appearing \nnodule within left lower lobe in ___ months\n[  ] ENT follow up with the patient regarding the biopsy results \nfrom the tongue mass - Dr. ___, ___\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list may be inaccurate and requires \nfuther investigation.\n1.

Status post sphincterotomy and stent placement. Patient \nstill with\ndelirium.\n \nSTUDY: Complete abdomen ultrasound.\n \nFINDINGS:\nThe liver size and texture are normal in appearance. There is no \ncoarsening\nor increased echogenicity within the liver to suggest fatty \nliver or\ncirrhosis. The contour does not appear nodular to suggest \ncirrhosis either.\nWithin the right lobe, likely within the segment VII near the \nhepatic dome, is\nan oval echogenic lesion that is not completely well-defined \nmeasuring 2.0 x\n1.5 x 1.1 cm. This does not demonstrate flow.\n \nThere are markedly dilated intrahepatic bile ducts. The left \nintrahepatic\nducts and segment IV intrahepatic ducts are filled with \nhypoechoic material\nconsistent with obstructed bile. The bile ducts, however, within \nsegment V,\nVI, and possibly VII and VIII, are filled with echogenic \nmaterial which does\nnot shadow, consistent with sludge and debris as seen on the \nrecent ERCP.\nMultiple round echogenic structures are seen within the \nextrahepatic bile\nducts where visualized, some of which are shadowing, consistent \nwith stones\nand sludge balls. The inferior most aspect of the CBD is not \nwell seen\nsecondary to obscuration by bowel gas and obscuration from the \ngallbladder.\nThe gallbladder is distended but is filled with sludge and \nstones. There is\nnormal gallbladder wall thickness, however, the gallbladder wall \nis striated\nand is edematous in appearance. There is no wall continuity \nevident. There\nis no pericholecystic fluid. The patient did not have tenderness \nover the\ngallbladder at the time of the exam.\n \nVisualization of the pancreas is suboptimal with only small \nportion of the\nbody\/neck visualized which does not show duct dilation. The \nspleen is mildly\nenlarged measuring 13.6 cm in greatest dimension. No focal \nsplenic lesion.\nBilateral kidneys are normal in size, contour, and echogenicity \nwith right\nkidney 10.4 cm and the left kidney 10.3 cm. There is slight \nlobulation of the\nright kidney. The renal parenchymal echogenicity is within \nnormal limits. No\nhydronephrosis. No calculus. There is suboptimal visualization \nof the aorta,\nhowever, its caliber within the visualized portions in the \nabdomen is normal.\nNo ascites.\n \nIMPRESSION:\n1. Marked intrahepatic bile duct dilation with the left biliary \nsystem and\nright anterior biliary system filled with subtle lucent bile but \nthe right\nposterior biliary system filled with echogenic material \nconsistent with sludge\nand debris. Extensive choledocholithiasis incompletely \nevaluated. The left\nbiliary dilation would suggest that the stent placed is not \nproperly\nfunctioning.\n \n2. Cholelithiasis with large amount of sludge within the \ngallbladder and an\nedematous wall. This picture could be consistent with early \nacute\ncholecystitis, however, the patient was not tender during the \ntime of\nexamination. Close followup clinically is recommended and if \nthere is concern\nfor acute cholecystitis, repeat ultrasound or MRCP could be \nperformed as\nclinically indicated.\n \n3. 2-cm echogenic hepatic lesion likely within the segment VII \nof the liver\nis fairly well-defined. This could represent a hemangioma, \nhowever, in this\npatient with a complicated biliary pathology, this is uncertain. \nIf the\npatient's condition worsened, CT or MRI could evaluate further. \nIf the\npatient's condition improves, an MRI is recommended within the \nthree months to\ncharacterize completely.\n \n4. No definite evidence of cirrhosis. Mild splenomegaly is \nnonspecific. No\nascites.\n \n5. Suboptimal visualization of the pancreas, but no duct \ndilation within the\nbody\/neck.\n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ old male, AIDS (CD4 20), has not cared for himself in \nyears, no meds except high doses of methadone for his substance \nabuse, and ativan abuse (off friends) but  none 2weeks PTA, \nincreasing confusion for past year, progressive, jaundice \nX3months, finally told his daughter he is scared to die, so she \nbought him to hospital (___) where he was noted to have CBD \ndilation and LFT elevation, so transferred to ___ for ERCP.  \n.\n\n# Choledocholithiasis, possible cholangitis: At OSH it was noted \npt had cholestatic elevation of LFTs and CBD dilation, so pt was \ntransferred to ___ for ERCP. He underwent ERCP ___, multiple \nstones noted in CBD, so pt underwent sphicterotomy\/stent placed. \nRecommended cipro\/flagyl X7days which pt received. Pt will need \nrepeat ERCP in 4 weeks for stent removal. Pts alk phos and T \nbili began to trend down to 2.0 by discharge, but alk phos \nremained elevated up into the 800s-900s. Per ERCP, this \npersistent alkaline phosphatase elevation is to be expected with \na CBD stent in place. RUQ US ___ comments on sludge in R \nbiliary tree, L biliary tree dilation, sludge\/stones in GB, and \nremaining stones\/sludge in CBD. Per discussion with ERCP fellow, \nplan will be to go back in in 4 weeks for repeat ERCP to clean \nout remaining stones. Given bilirubin has been trending down and \npts mental status has been improving,  ERCP did not want to go \nback in to do any further ERCP procedure at this time.\n.\n# Delirium\/Encephelopathy: Per family, pt has had ongoing \nconfusion for over a year, but worse over the past 2 months, \nunclear how acute his current delirium was. His worsening \ndelirium certainly could be his choledocholithiasis. He \nunderwent ERCP with stone extraction as per above and was \ntreated with cipro\/flagyl, but pt had acute episode of agitation \neven after the ERCP was completed and stones were removed. \nAdvanced AIDS brings up infectious, neoplastic, and AIDS related \netiologies. Note, TSH, B12 were normal. RPR was negative. He had \nno evidence of benzo\/ETOH withdrawl (tox negative on admission \nand daughter\/pt deny recent use; also, stable vital signs). \nUA\/CXR were unremarkable. MRI of the head was not impressive (no \nsuggestion of infection or PML). LP was performed on ___ and \nhad only 3 WBC, unremarkable protein\/glucose. ___ virus PCR was \nnegative in the CSF. CSF HIV VL was 1040. CSF VDRL was pending \nat discharge. CSF cytology was negative for malignant cells. Of \nnote, pt had acute agitation episode ___ am with a CODE Purple \ncalled, required haldol\/ativan and psychiatric evaluation. He \nwas calm the following day. Highest on the differential of pts \ndelirium and intermittent agitation is HIV encephalopathy. ID \nfelt that resuming ___ is the only chance for any reversal, \nbut resuming ___ was complicated by pts social situation as \nper below. Also, given pts h\/o Hep C, cirrhosis and hepatic \nencephalopathy was felt to be possible. He was started on \nlactulose as a trial to see if this would help with pts \nconfusion. RUQ US showed no evidence of cirrhosis or nodular \ncontour to the liver. Lactulose was stopped.  Pts mental status \ndid improve while here, possibly due to either ERCP with \ncleaning of some of the CBD sludge vs. lactulose. He was started \non ___ on ___ as per below. Pt was evaluated by OT, and pt \nhad ___ recall (although delayed), mild impairment in medication \nmanagement, and anxiety over performing complex tasks. It was \nfelt by OT that pt is safe to be discharged home alone ( he was \nable to say what to do in case of fire, in case of injury, etc; \nhe does not use the stove) as long as someone checks in on him \nand helps him with his medications. Pt will have outpatient OT \nhome visits and home safety eval.\n.\n.\n# AIDS: Pt had recent CD4 17, on repeat here was 70. HIV viral \nload here was 283,000. Has refused ARVs in past, even recently \nhad been restarted ___ but never filled his prescriptions. Pt \nnow expressed interest in treatment, especially given concern of \nHIV encephalopathy.  Pt is s\/p LP\/MRI as above to eval \nreversible causes and to eval for PML, CNS lymphoma, TB, \nneurosyphilis, etc. CSF cytology was negative, and culture for \nboth fungal\/bacterial were negative at time of discharge.  He \nwas continued on bactrim prophylaxis and azithromycin \nprophylaxis was started. He received nystatin for thrush. Upon \ndiscussion between pt, ID,and pts outpatient ID Dr. ___, \n___ was made to restart pt on Truvada and Kaletra. \nDiscussion between this hospitalist, pt, SW, and daughter took \nplace in which it was decided that pts daughter would need to \nbring pts ___ medications with her to pts house twice a day in \norder to ensure complicance. Meeting between this hospitalist, \nID, social work, pt, pt's daughter, and case management took \nplace,  discussing barriers to compliance. Pts daughter agrees \nto bring pts ___ meds directly to him twice a day under her \nobservation for at least the first several months. Pt also \ndiscusses sometimes having dysphagia and depression (causing \nbinges on benzos) which are barriers. See below for further \ndiscussion of these. The patient will need to follow up with ID, \nDr. ___, in 4 weeks for lab check and refill on his ___ \nmedications. \n\n# HCV:  LFTs elevated likely ___ choledocholithasis (alk \nphos\/tbili) but transaminitis may reflect chronic active hep C. \nINR is WNL, but albumin low at 2.5. Unclear if TBili elevation \nmay be chronic as well. HCV viral load was 5,360,000. Again, RUQ \nUS here showed no nodular contour to liver or evidence of \ncirrhosis. Pt will follow up with his outpatient ID doctor.\n.\n# Liver lesion:  Following pts discharge, pts final read on his \nliver ultrasound states\" 2-cm echogenic hepatic lesion likely \nwithin the segment VII of the liver is fairly well-defined. This \ncould represent a hemangioma, however, in this patient with a \ncomplicated biliary pathology, this is uncertain. If the \npatient's condition worsened, CT or MRI could evaluate further. \nIf the patient's condition improves, an MRI is recommended \nwithin the three months to characterize completely.\" Thus, would \nrecommend follow up MRI to further characterize this lesions. \nPts PCP, ___ be sent a copy of this discharge \nsummary as well as a fax regarding this finding.\n.\n# Social:  Difficult disposition as pt has not cared for himself \nfor long time exhibiting self-destructive behavior, now \nresulting in encephelopathy (?dementia) with periods of \nworsening delirium. Unclear how much is reversible. ID feels \nonly chance is ___ therapy but needs monitored setting to \nensure compliance. As per above, pt was assessed by OT and felt \nsafe to go home with supervision of his medication management. \nPts daughter has agreed to come to his home twice a day with his \n___ medications. Pt will have home ___, OT, and SW arranged at \ntime of discharge.  \n\n# Polysubstance abuse\/IVDU: Pt is on 149 mg methadone daily at \nhis clinic, confirmed. Pt received 140 mg daily while here.  \nAddictions was consulted, especially given pts abuse of ativan \nand need for ___ compliance. \n.\n# Dysphagia: Pt reports one of his barriers to taking his HIV \nmedications is having difficulty swallowing his pills. ERCP \ncommented on no strictures in the esophagus\/stomach. Per pts \ndaughter, pt has had a negative UGI series in the past. He has \nnot had difficulty swallowing his pills here thus far. Can \nconsider outpatient barium swallow to assess motility if pt \ncomplains of further dysphagia.\n.\n# Depression: Pt admits to feeling depressed, which causes him \nto binge on benzos. We discussed that restarting ___ may help \nsome of his depression. He will have social work visit his home. \nHe agreed to starting celexa, which he was discharged on.\n\n.\n\n \nMedications on Admission:\nmethadone 140 mg po qd\nSupposed to be on bactrim ppx, truvada, kaletra. \n \nDischarge Medications:\n1.

It is most likely that the nausea and vomiting is due to atrophic gastritis (inflammation of the stomach lining). You also have signs of either a small tear in the esophagus or an area of injury that may be contributing to the nausea and vomiting and is probably the cause of the blood in the vomit. Please continue to take pantoprazole (to reduce stomach acid), sucralfate (to line the stomach and protect it from acid) and ondansetron (to treat nausea). There are additional medications that you can take as needed for persistent nausea. You should have another endoscopy in 2 months to further evaluate the stomach and esophagus and to allow for biopsy of the area of injury in the esophagus. Biopsy is essential to know what this area is and to make sure there is not underlying cancer. Avoid all aspirin containing products and non-steroidal anti-inflammatories as these can worsen your symptoms. For now please stick to a full liquid diet."}

Med were \nalso crushed before administering  \n\n# Subdural hemorrhages vs hygromas: found on head CT in the ED, \nappear chronic, likely from past falls. Seen by neurosurg in the \nED who did not feel there was any intervention necessary \n(including decadron).  Patient's neuro exam was monitored \nthroughout the admission  \n)  \n \n# CK elevation: had been essentially bedbound recently, so \nlikely due simply to relative immobilization.

Her insulin regimen \nwas changed from 5OU to lantus and close follow-up was arranged. \nConcern for Munchausen Syndrome was raised in the setting of \nwitnessed sugar consumption and ultimate down-titration of \ninsulin requirement. \n.\nACTIVE ISSUES:\n# Hyperglycemia: Ms. ___ has difficult to control blood \nsugars, possibly secondary to insulin lipodistrophy vs. DMII \ndifficult to control s\/p pancreatectomy vs. Munchausen. She \ninterestingly responded dramatically from 500s to 300s with 10 \nunits insulin in the emergency department which was replicated \non the general medical floor, supporting a diagnosis of insulin \nlipodistrophy. However, the patient was also found eating sugar \npackets while having high blood sugars.  In this scenario, it \nwas difficult to titrate her insulin regimen.  She was given \nextensive counseling from the ___ consult service and general \nmedical team regarding glucose control.  A psychiatry consult \nwas placed given concern for Munchausen in light of her labile \nblood sugars, outpatient glucose regimen for concentrated \ninsulin, witnessed sugar packet consumption and multiple prior \nadmissions for hyperglycemia often complicated by diabetic \nketoacidosis.  The pschiatry consult felt there was \"no clear \nevidence that Ms. ___ was intentionally contributing to \nworsening of her illness; although she may have deficits in \nunderstanding the correct approach to managing her illness, and \nsubtle neuropsychiatric contributions could be considered.\"  She \nwas ultimately discharged on 20 units of lantus with a \nsignificant humalog sliding scale and close follow-up with both \nher primary care physician and ___ providers.  \n.\nIf she were to be re-admitted, consideration for an insulin gtt \nshould be made despite absence of anion gap acidosis for a \nbetter assessment of her insulin requirement in addition to \ndirect observation of her nutritional intake.\n.\nINACTIVE ISSUES:\n# Chronic pain: She has chronic migraine headaches, right face \nand arm complex regional pain syndrome requiring pain clinic \nnerve blocks, and chronic abdominal pain from pancreatitis. She \nwas started on sumatriptan in place of her home triptan not \nprovided through non-formulary, in addition to home gabapentin \nand doxepin. She  was discharged on her home regimen.\n.\n# Chronic nausea: Followed by GI as an outpatient. She was \ncontinued on metoclopramide and omeprazole.\n.\n# Hypertension: She was continued on clonidinde and propranolol.\n.\n# Iron deficiency anemia: She has received IV iron in the past \nwith good result.\n.\n# Migraine headaches: She was continued on topamax and \nnaratriptan.

You were diagnosed with insulin lipodystrophy, which is the formation of scar tissue and crystallization of insulin from repeated injections into one site. The problem with that scarring is that there are very few blood vessels, leading to poor absorption of the insulin that you do inject and escalating doses to achieve the same effect. A consult from the ___ helped to create a new insulin regimen for you on which you will be discharged. Please use several different sites to inject your insulin and rotate between them. Do not inject into your old location on your belly anymore. We were also concerned to note that you were eating sugar packets. If your blood sugar is low, please drink orange juice or eat peanut butter."}

Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system \ndemonstrated no angiographically-apparent flow-limiting \nstenosis. The \nLMCA, LAD, LCx, and RCA all had no obstructive disease. There \nwas \nhaziness in the mid LAD however. \n2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed normal right sided \nfilling \npressures with RA 5 mmHg and RVEDP 7 mmHg and mildly elevated \nleft sided \nfilling pressures with PCWP 11 mmHg and LVEDP 15 mmHg. There was \nmild \npulmonary arterial systolic hypertension with PASP 33 mmHg. \nThere was no \ngradient across the aortic valve upon careful pullback of the \ncatheter \nfrom the LV to the ascending aorta. \n  \nFINAL DIAGNOSIS:     \n1. Minimal disease in the LAD with some haziness that may \nrepresent a \nsite of plaque rupture with superimposed calcium. \n2. Recommend at least aspirin, and possibly clopidogrel. \n\nECHO ___\nConclusions\nThe left atrial volume index is normal. The estimated right \natrial pressure is ___ mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses \nare normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is \nmoderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction in the \nterritory of a mid LAD occlusion (see chart for details). The \nestimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L\/min\/m2). Doppler \nparameters are most consistent with Grade I (mild) left \nventricular diastolic dysfunction. Right ventricular chamber \nsize and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets \n(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and \nno aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve \nappears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. \nThe pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. \nThere is an anterior space which most likely represents a \nprominent fat pad. \n\nIMPRESSION: Moderate regional left ventricular systolic \ndysfunction c\/w CAD in the territory of a mid LAD. Grade I left \nventricular diastolic dysfunction. No clinically significant \nvalvular abnormalities noted.\n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ COPD (no home O2), CVT, anxiety, p\/w SOB and chest tightness \nat OSH, OSH course notable for ini of IV solumedrol for ?COPD \nexacerbation, IV lasix for ?pulm edema, also with new LV \nsystolic dysfunction\n\n# COPD flare - pt presented with SOB, hypoxia, increased \nproductive cough, most consistent with COPD exacerbation.  Pt \narrived from OSH at 4L, she has received doxycyline and IV \nsolumedrol at OSH prior to transfer.  Pt was transitioned to PO \nprednisone for ___s well as doxycyline for 7 day \ncourse.  Pt was kept on standing albuterol and ipratropium nebs, \nwhich was weaned down to prn.  Home advair was restarted after \npt finished the steroid course. Pt had significant improvement \nof breathing status.  On discharge, she was breathing \ncomfortably on room air with good O2 sat at both at rest and on \nambulation. She was discharged home with her home inhaler \nregimen and without her prior daily azithromycin dose. She has \nclose PCP and pulmonary clinic follow up.\n\n# NSTEMI with plaque rupture vs. stress cardiomyopathy vs. \ncoronary vasospasm - Pt presented with chest tightness along \nwith COPD exacerbation.  Troponin T was 0.2 > 0.03, MB was 11 > \n3. ECHO showed new moderate regional left ventricular systolic \ndysfunction c\/w CAD in the territory of a mid LAD. Pt therefore \nunderwent cath.  Cath however did not reveal significant \nocclusion thus no stent was placed. Cath however did find \nhaziness at LAD region, raising the possibility of possible \nplaque rupture.  Pt was discharged home with plavix and aspirin. \nShe was also started on a ace-i, beta blocker, and statin prior \nto discharge. Appointment was made with new cardiologist at \n___.  It is recommended that pt has follow up ECHO in \na few months to eval for possible resolution of systolic \ndysfunction given concern for potential stress cardiomyopathy in \nthe setting of COPD flare.\n\n# Sinus tachycardia -  Initially presented with sinus \ntachycardia, thought to be related to standing albuterol \ninhalers as well as anxiety.  OSH CTA was negative for PE.  Pt \nwas started on metoprolol. She was given ativan prn for anxiety. \n Tylenol was prescribed prn for pain.  Sinus tachycardia \nimproved with resolution of COPD flare and reduction of \nalbuteroil usage.  On Discharge, pt's heart rate was within \nnormal limits.  She was discharged home with metoprolol.\n\n# GERD - stable on home Ranitidine 150 mg PO\/NG BID\n\n## TRANSITIONAL ISSUE\n- ___ HAS BEEN ON CHRONIC AZITHROMYCIN, WHICH WAS D\/C'D THIS \nADMISSION\n- ___ WILL BE BENEFITED FROM ASA 81 LIFELONG AND PLAVIX FOR AT \nLEAST 6 MONTHS - ___ YEAR. DURATION OF PLAVIX SHOULD BE DETERMINED \nAT THE DISCRETION OF OUTPATIENT CARDIOLOGIST\n- ___ WILL BENEFIT FROM OUTPATIENT FOLLOW UP CARDIAC ECHO TO F\/U \nON SYSTOLIC DYSFUNCTION.\n- IT IS POSSIBLE HER PRESENTATION WAS CONSISTENT WITH VASOSPASM \nGIVEN NEW FOCAL WALL ABNORMALITY BUT UNREMARKABLE CATH.

There was also some concern that you may have a problem with your heart because of some blood tests and EKG findings. We did an echocardiogram which showed reduced heart functioning which raised concern that you had maybe had a heart attack. We then did a heart catheterization to see if you actually had evidence of narrow heart arteries which would have caused a heart attack. We saw some slight abnormality in one of the main arteries, but nothing that seemed to be responsible for what happened and nothing that we could fix with a stent. It is likely you had a blockage of that artery in the past and it has opened up a bit since. Alternatively, you may have had stress-induced cardiac dysfunction in the setting of your severe shortness of breath with your COPD flare. We will need you to repeat an echocardiogram in a few months with your cardiologist to see if your heart function improves. We started a new medication called plavix to help blood flow around this area if there is some blockage. You should take this medicine for ___ months."}

He \nwas admitted to the stroke service from ___ to ___.\n.\nAt the time of his arrival at the ___, a code stroke was \ncalled.  His exam had returned to baseline and he was given an \nNIHSS of 0.  To evaluate for contributory lesions, a CT of the \nhead and neck with angiography and perfusion was performed.  The \nimaging was thought to be normal.  To evaluate for evidence of \nstroke, an MRI\/A of the head and neck was done.  The studies \nshowed no evidence of acute infarction and no evidence of \nvascular occlusion, stenosis or aneurysm greater than 3 mm in \nsize. \n.\nA transthoracic echocardiogram was performed to evaluate for \ncardiac contributions to the patient's symptom complex. The \nfinal report was pending at the time of discharge.  It was \nrecommended that he take asprirn 325 mg by mouth daily pending \nthe results of the study.\n.\nTo evaluate modifiable risk factors for stroke, lipids and \nglycosylated hemoglobin were measured.  As the LDL was found to \nbe 92, no changes were made to the statin dosing.  Although the \nHBA1C was 5.4 %, blood glucose was monitored regularly and an \ninsulin sliding scale was instituted to maintain normoglycemia.\n.\nAs there was some concern that the episode could have been a \nseizure, an EEG was done.  Although the final report was pending \nat the time of discharge, an initial interpretation was \nessentially normal.  For his safety, however, it was suggested \nthat he refrain from driving at least until the results of the \ninvestigative bloodwork return.\n.\nUpon further interview, the patient volunteered that he might \nhave taken 1.5 tabs of ambien (rather than 1.5 tabs of \npravastatin) by mistake on the morning of the event.  An ambien \nlevel was added to outside hospital labwork and sent out from \nthe ___ as well.  In the absence of other clear etiologies, \nand the nature of the presenting syndrome, it is thought that \nthe effects of medication could account for the symptoms.\n.\nThe patient was discharged home.\n  \n\n \nMedications on Admission:\nMedications - \nASA 81\nCa\/VitD\nPrilosec 20\nAlbuterol prn\nAmbien prn sleep\n.\nAllergies- none\n\n \nDischarge Medications:\n1.

However, this \nwas not the case as her eosinophil count remained low and her \nLFTs continued to improve.  The medical team and dermatology \nconsultant initially felt the rash was consistent with a \ndrug-induced rash and their highest suspicion for a causative \nagent was ursodiol.  Nonetheless, omeprazole and keppra have \nalso been known to cause rashes.  However, on further \nexamination, dermatology felt the rash was more consistent with \nher underlying eczema and possibile miliaria and her itching \nrelated to dry skin and recent bilirubin elevation.  They \nrecommended several medications which were started in the \nhospital.  Hepatology was also consulted and was fine with \nstopping ursodiol and the anti-pruitic regimen recommended by \ndermatology (fexofenadine, hydroxyzine, petrolatum, and topical \nsteroids).  Neurology was also consulted due to initial concern \nthat the rash could be caused by keppra, however, they had a low \nsuspicion that this was the causative agent.\n    \n# Cholestatic liver failure \/ DRESS: LFTs, Tbili, and synthetic \nfunction were monitored and noted to further improve from prior \ndischarge.  She was continued on prednisone with plan for slow \ntaper as an outpatient.  She will need to be seen by \ngastroenterology.  Due to confusion as to whether she should \nfollow-up with Dr. ___ she had already seen, or a ___ \ngastroenterologist, this decision was deferred to the patient's \nPCP.  Her PCP may also wish to consider referring the patient to \nDr. ___, a local expert in eosinophils and related \ndiseases. \n   \n# Anemia: The patient was noted to be anemic on presentation \n(hct 29) and her anemia was stable during her hospital course.  \nShe did not receive any blood transfusions.  She did have one \nepisode of rectal bleeding following an enema that was felt to \nbe traumatic.  This issue will require additional follow-up as \nan outpatient. \n     \n# ?Seizure disorder: The patient has no clear history of \nseizures, only an unrelated syncopal event earlier in the month \nfor which she was seen at an outside hospital, and myclonus in \nthe setting of hepatic encephalopathy during her last \nhospitalization.  Neurology was consulted and they recommended a \nroutine EEG.  Based on the lack of seizure activity, they were \ncomfortable with stopping keppra and recommended further \noutpatient follow-up.\n  \n# Depression and anxiety: The patient was continued on \nfluoxetine and seroquel.\n    \n# Constipation: The patient was placed on a bowel regimen with \nresolution of her symptoms. \n\n \nMedications on Admission:\nCalcium carbonate-vitamin D3 [Calcium with Vitamin D]\n600 mg(1,500mg) -400 unit Tablet daily\nFluoxetine 20 mg daily\nLevetiracetam 500 mg BID - patient ran out yesterday\nMultivitamin daily\nOmeprazole 20 mg daily\nPrednisone 40 mg daily\nQuetiapine 150 mg QHS\nUrsodiol 300 mg TID\n\n \nDischarge Medications:\n1.

Pulmonary \nvasculature is \nslightly more distended, but there is no pulmonary edema and no \nfocal findings in the lungs to suggest pneumonia nor any pleural \neffusion or mediastinal widening to explain dropping hematocrit. \nTransvenous right atrial and right ventricular pacer leads are \nunchanged in their respective positions since at least ___. \n\n___: EKG\nSupraventricular tachycardia likely of sinus etiology with \ndemand ventricular pacing and a left bundle-branch block \npattern. Compared to the previous tracing of ___ the rate \nhas increased. \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ yo f w\/ N\/V\/diarrhea guiaic +, abd pain; no fevers, recent \nabx use, or other predisposing factors.\n.\n# n\/v\/diarrhea: Given the elevated WBC 25 with 95% PMN, and \nguiaic+, there is concern for infx etiology. Ischemic colitis \nlikelihood seems low given CT neg. She was treated with zofran \nprn and IV protonix for suspect of an occult GI bleed. Her HCT \nwas down to 24 on ___, EGD showed ?ischemic esophagus \n(esophageal mucosa had a whitened appearance), received 1U pRBC, \nfluids, hemodynamics improved, HCT then trended up to 32.0 upon \ndischarge. A number of labs including BCx, UCx, o+p, C diff were \nsent; however, they were all negative. Stool cultures are still \npending. It was felt that the patient did not need an inpt \ncolonoscopy as her HCT improved. She can discuss this with Dr. \n___ her ___ appointment. She may also discuss the \nesophageal biopsy findings and her final stool culture results \nwith him. It was also noted on her CT abd\/pelvis that the \npatient had a new T12 compression fracture, stable autosomal \ndominant polycystic kidney disease, stable rt renal calculi with \nmild hydronephrosis, and stable sub-4-mm bibasilar noncalcified \nlung nodules which probably do not require followup as there is \nlow clinical suspicion. We have held her aspirin 81mg and \nnorvasc 5mg until her HCT are rechecked in a few days as an \noutpatient. If they are normal, she can resume these medicines. \nMoreover, the question of ischemic esophagus led us to hold the \nnorvasc. \n.\n# ARF: Pt has CKD probably secondary to known ADPCKD, baseline \nCr 1.3. Initially she was dehydrated and her renal failure was \nthought to be pre-renal BUN 45, Cr 2.1 (BUN\/CRE > 20:1) with a \ncomponent of hypochloremic metab alkalosis probably secondary to \nn\/v. Urine lytes also c\/w prerenal. Initially her, UOP <50cc, HR \n90-100; however, she has an EF of 25% so the patient received \ngentle IVF. Upon discharge the patient had good UOP, and her Cr \nwas at her baseline of 1.2, and BUN 25.  She should have repeat \nelectrolyte check on ___.\n.\n# Hypertension - patient became hypotensive per above, so we \nheld her home norvasc 5mg. also there was concern for ischemic \nesophagitis per EGD findings. \n.\n# U\/A - Initially, a U\/A showed WBC ___, and in the setting of \n___ ___ hospitalization as well as serum WBC 25 a repeat U\/A \nwas performed but was negative. The patient had a foley placed \ninitially for tight monitoring of UOP. The foley was \ndiscontinued 24 hrs before discharge and she urinated normally. \n.\n# Temp - She also spiked a temp to 101.2 during her first \nhospital night, and given her initial WBC of 25, bcx x2 were \ndrawn but have been negative to date. These results are not \nfinalized and should be followed up as an outpatient.\n.\n# Asthma - On home the patient is normally on room air; however, \nduring her stay the pt was initially on 2L probably secondary to \nlow HCT. We continued her home cont Singulair 10mg daily, Advair \n1 puff daily, and also had to use levo-albuterol nebs x1.

No significant valvular disease seen. \nNormal estimated intracardiac filling pressures with high \ncardiac output.  \n.\nCT head: IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process. Fluid within \nthe sinuses as above, most likely due to intubation. \n.\nRenal ultrasound: IMPRESSION: No evidence of renal obstruction.\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ male w\/ h\/o substance abuse and depression, found altered, \nhypothermic and hypotensive.  After his ICU admission he was \ntransferred to the floor in stable condition although his \ncreatinine continued to rise.  After that improved with no \nintervention other than diuresis, he was discharged in stable \ncondition to a shelter for help with his polysubstance \ndependency issues.\n.\n# Altered mental status: Most likely secondary to an ingestion. \nPatient later admitted to heroin ingestion. Percocet and \nOxycontin bottles found in his room. Urine tox positive for \nopiates (on a screen that does not detect oxycodone) and \ncocaine. Other possibilities would be sepsis, post-ictal phase, \ntoxic\/metabolic encephalopathy, hepatic or renal encephalopathy. \nToxicology was consulted and thought this could be due to \ntylenol overdose or cocaine in setting of elvated LFTs, although \nOSH tylenol was negative. Patient started on ___ protocol and \ncompleted with resolution of LFTs. Patient mental status cleared \nby the time patient was tranferred to the floor. Patient states \nhis only ingestion leading up to admission was his home vicodin, \nheroin (inhaled) and clonipin. Patient MS continued to improve \nbut in setting of worsening renal failure, patient carefully \nmonitered for uremic encephalopathy.  On the floor the patients \nmental status returned to normal, labs improved and the patient \nwas discharged with a normal mental status.\n.\n# Hypotension\/hypothermia: Differential originally included drug \noverdose, hypovolemia and overwhelming infection. Patient had no \nsource of infection as CXR and lung exam clear, UA negative, no \nabdominal pain therefore antbiotics were withheld. Per \ntoxicology, differential of ingestion in setting of initial \nbradycardia includes calcium channel blockers, beta blockers and \ndigoxin. Patient had no change in blood sugars and his digoxin \nlevel was negative. Patient was continued on IVF wide open, \nespecially in setting of rhabdo. Patient was eventually weaned \nfrom pressors that were started in the MICU. Once patient had \nstable BP for 24hrs, patient was transferred to the floor. \nPatient continued to have stable blood pressures for the rest of \nhis admission. \n.\n# Transaminitis: Most likely due such as Tylenol vs shock liver. \nStarted on N-Acetylcysteine in ED, received full course. Believe \nthat LFTs could have been elevated with acute tylenol overdose \nbut hypoperfusion is more likely especially as patient has signs \nof hypoperfusion with his kidneys with evidence of ATN. LFTs \ncontinue to downtrend. INR continues to downtrend as well. At \ntime of discharge his LFTs had normalized, his INR was baseline \nand he did not require further checks of his LFTs.\n.\n# Rhabdomyolysis: Appears to be localized primarily to his lower \nextremities. Could be cocaine, an exercise supplement, or \nprolonged period down. Patient started on aggressive fluid \nresuscitation for his first few days in the MICU. Patient \ncontinued to have downtrending CK with eventual DC of fluids \nespecially in the setting of worsening renal failure.\n.\n# Acute renal failure: Likely a combination of hypovolemia \n(hypoperfusion) and rhabdomyolysis. Patient aggressively fluid \nresuscitated as above, with down trending CK. Urinalysis showed \nevidence of muddy brown casts consistent with ATN, most likely \ndue to hypoperfusion. Renal ultrasound was negative for any \nother acute process. Patient creatinine continued to trend up, \nas well as BUN. Patient was hypervolemic on examination and per \nrenal given large dose lasix to try to improve kidney function. \nPatient was monitered for signs of uremic encephalopathy. \nPatient also had increasing anion gap most likely due to uremia. \nPatient was followed by nephrology and did not require any HD as \nhe reached plateau and then began having downtrending creatinine \nwhich was siginificantly improved at the time of disposition.  \nUrine output remained excellent\n.\n# Elevated lipase: Likely from hypotension, never c\/o abdominal \npain. Lipase trended down with fluid resuscitation.\n.\n# Elevated troponin: Likely from overall hypoperfusion. EKG was \nreassuring. Enzymes were trended and came down without EKG \nchanges. \n.\n# Depression\/substance abuse: Patient has hx of severe \ndepression. It was unclear if patient had suicide attempt. Per \nfamily, patient's depression has been getting more severe and in \nturn his drug abuse more frequent. Social work was involved in \npatient's care early. Once patient's sensorium cleared, patient \nevaluated by psych who thought the patient was stable from a \npsychiatric point of view.  He will be discharged to a shelter \nwhere he can continue his rehabilitation.\n.\nTransitional care:\n1. CODE: Full\n2. Medication changes: No longer on anti-depressants\n3.

He was treated for a \npneumonia with IV antibiotics and transferred to an LTAC for \nfurther care. His hospital course was complicated by tachycardia \nand volume overload.\n.\nACTIVE ISSUES\n# Septic Shock: At outside hospital, patient met SIRS criteria \nwith tachycardia, bandemia and tachypnea.  He was afebrile, but \nhypotensive and not responsive to fluid boluses, and had a \nlactate of >9.  CXR at outside hospital, and confirmed at ___ \nshowed new right lower lobe opacity.  In addition, he had a \npositive urinalysis.  Patient was started on broad spectrum \nantibiotics with vancomycin, levofloxacin and meropenem to cover \nhospital acquired pneumonia and urinary tract infection, with \nhistory of ESBL e.coli UTIs.  Lactate trended down, was 3 on \narrival to ___, and was normal by HD1.  Patient required a \ntotal of 6L NS in fluids, and then was placed on phenylephrine \nfor blood pressure support.  Pressors were weaned on HD1.  \nPatient had a PICC line placed on HD1 for antibiotic \nadministration, with plan to continue broad spectrum antibiotics \nfor 14 days, day 1= ___.  At the time of discharge, urine \nculture was positive for both enterococcus and ecoli, which were \nspeciated to VRE however < 3000 colonies so therfore not \ntreated. Sputum cultures were contaminated but speciated to \npseudomonas and ecoli.  Blood cultures were still pending or \nnegative at the time of transfer. At the time of transfer he was \nday ___ of meropenem for esbl pneumonia.  He completed 7 days \nof vancomycin which was discontinued prior to transfer given \nabsence of culture driven data.\n- Continue IV Meropenem for 6 additional days to complete 14 day \ncourse\n.\n# Hypoxic respiratory distress: Thought to be due to recurrent \npneumonia, likely aspiration despite tube feeds through PEG.  On \narrival to ICU, sat's were in the ___ on tach mask at FiO2 35%. \nABG 7.44\/___.  Patient was treated with broad spectrum \nantibiotics as above, with plan to treat for 14 days.  Patient \nwas at his baseline at the time of discharge.  Interventional \npulmonology saw patient while in-house and were concerned about \nrecurrent aspirations and recommended that G-tube be changed to \nJ-tube.  Head of bed was elevated to prevent aspirations in \naddition to frequent suctioning of oral secretions.  He was \ndiuresed prior to transfer given total fluid balance during his \nhospital stay was over 10 liters.

Patient was evaluated \nfor her subdural hematoma in ED and it was found to be stable \nand not requiring acute neurosurgical intervention. She was \nadmitted to medicine for work up of her fall at home.\n.\n# Fall: Patient herself is giving a story of falling after \ngetting out of the bathroom after urinating in the middle of the \nnight. States that she was unable to get up after falling. \nSuspicion of seizure low as she did not exhibit any postictal \nconfusion, no loss of bowel\/bladder. No focal neurologic exam \nfinding and negative head CT (except for small subdural hematoma \nas below), which makes concern for stroke\/TIA less likely. \nCardiac work up-wise, patient was ruled out for MI\/ACS with two \nsets of negative cardiac enzymes in the hospital. Her EKG on \nadmission did not show any evidence of AV block or other \ndysrhythmias. Pt was monitored on telemetry overnight without \nevent. ? of orthostatic hypotension given patient's complaint of \ndizziness after her fall, but orthostatic vitals were negative \non admission, though it was after receiving 1 L of fluid in OSH \nED. ___ be due to reported weakness (with question of statin \nmyopathy vs. polymyalgia rheumatica) though patient denies \nweakness. Her hydrochlorothiazide was held in the setting of \nconcern for hypovolemia. \n___ consult was obtained to evaluate the patient for fall \nrisk. They recommended rolling walker for the patient as well as \nhome physical therapy. \n\n# Subdural hematoma: first noted on head CT at ___ \n___, and patient was transferred to ___ for neurosurgery \nevaluation. 2mm subdural hematoma stable on repeat imaging here. \nNeurosurgery thought it did not require any acute intervention \nat this time. They recommended holding aspirin for 2 days, so it \nwas held on ___ and ___. Patient will follow up with \nneurosurgery with repeat head CT in a month, and the appointment \nhas been made for her.\n\n# Hypertension: Patient was continued on home verapamil with \nholding parameters given concern for orthostatic hypotension \nleading to fall. HCTZ and potassium supplement were held given \nconcern for hypovolemia and hypotension, as patient's systolic \nblood pressure remained in 110s. It can be restarted as \noutpatient if her blood pressure tolerates it well.\n\n# Osteoarthritis: No complaint of pain, but concern for pain \ncontributing to fall\/weakness. Patient's home pain regimen of \n650 mg tylenol q8 hours prn and celebrex ___ mg qdaily prn were \ncontinued in house.\n\n# ?Osteoporosis: patient reports fosamax as one of her \nmedications, but not on medication reconciliation with Dr. \n___.

CAD: The patient was recently admitted for an NSTEMI and had \n2 drug eluting stents placed.  Her cardiac cath showed patient \nstents and diffuse macrovascular disease consistent with \nunderlying diabetes.  Her chest pain was felt to be most likely \nrelated to uncontrolled hypertension.  On return to the floor \npost-cath, the patient continued to complain of chest pain.  A \nnitro drip was started and her blood pressure was lowered, \nhowever, she continued to complain of chest pain.  Chest pain \nwas relieved by morphine 2 mg IV, however, returned when this \nmedication wore off.  She was restarted on a beta-blocker and \nstarted on isosorbide to improve medical management of her CAD.  \nShe was continued on aspirin, clopidogrel, and a statin.  As the \npatient had initially complained of chest pain radiating to her \nback, had presented to the ED in hypertensive urgency, and a 20 \npoint different in systolic blood pressures between her left and \nright arms, she underwent a chest CTA to evaluate for aortic \ndissection.  No dissection was noted.  As the patient's \nhematocrit had dropped to 25 post-cath, the patient was \ntransfused with a unit of packed red blood cells.  Her chest \npain resolved after this and her hematocrit increased to 28.  \nShe was transfused one additional unit prior to discharge as it \nwas felt that she may have had some ischemia associated with the \nlower hematocrit and wound benefit symptomatically from \ntransfusion. \n \nThe patient was discharged on metoprolol and isosorbide and it \nwas explained to her that she should continue to take these \nmedications to better control her blood pressure, and \nCAD-related symptoms.   \n   \n#. Pump: ECHO on prior admission with LVEF 55-60%.   \n\n#. Hypertension: The patient's medication regimen had been \nchanged since her previous admission.  Notably, her beta-blocker \nhad been stopped.  She was restarted on a beta-blocker at a \nhigher dose as this was felt to benefit her post-MI, \nhydrochlorothiazide was stopped, and isosorbide was started.  \nThe patient had previously been on lisinopril, but did not \ntolerate this medication due to coughing.  Given her diabetes, \nshe may benefit from an ___.  Given the number of medication \nchanges, during this admission, decision to start the latter was \ndeferred to her cardiologist and PCP who will see her in \nfollow-up.  Urine analysis was negative for proteinuria.  \n   \n#. Diabetes, Type 2: The patient's home regimen of glargine 40 \nunits QAM was continued and the patient was placed on insulin \nsliding scale.

On review of her chest \nx-ray with her pulmonologist, Dr. ___ was decided that \nshe was unlikely to have a recurrent or partially treated \npneumonia, so antibiotics were stopped and she was placed on a \nprednisone taper in addition to her usual home medications.  Her \ndyspnea improved somewhat and by discharge she was closer to, \nbut not at, her baseline level of dyspnea.  She was also started \non theophylline 200 mg PO daily, but this may have caused her to \nhave several episodes of tachycardia, so it was stopped.  \nTheophylline levels eventually came back subtherapeutic, making \nit perhaps less likely that this drug was responsible.  She was \ndischarged with a nebulizer for levalbuterol treatments to use \nas an alternative to her levalbuterol inhalers, since she was \nreluctant to only use the nebulizer due to the additional time \ninvolved in treatments.\n.  \nELEVATED BICARBONATE: The patient's bicarbonate was initially \nnormal but rose into the mid to high ___.  According to Atrius \nrecords, this is near her baeline.  It is likely, given her \nCOPD, that she retains CO2 and has a chronic respiratory \nacidosis with metabolic compensation.\n.\nHYPOTHYROIDISM: Continued home levoxyl.  \n.  \nHYPERTENSION: Continued home hydrochlorothiazide.\n \nMedications on Admission:\ncholecalciferol 400 U daily  \nbudesonide-formoterol 160-4.5 mcg 2 inh BID  \nhydrochlorothiazide 25 mg daily  \nlevoxl 50 mcg \/100 mcg daily alternating  \ntiotropium bromide 18 mcg Inh daily  \nlevalbuterol 45 mcg\/actuation inhalation HFA 2 puff QID  \n1 multivitamin daily  \n\n \nDischarge Medications:\n1.

Her insidious onset of dry cough and \nextrapulmonary symptoms such as her diarrhea may be consistent \nwith atypical PNA, but her chest ___ was unremarkable.  Her \ncough was thought be less likely caused by post nasal drip given \nthat the patient denied any rhinorrheia, or sinus congestion. \nBlood cultures were obtained and she was continued on her \nalready ongoing ___. Given her initial dehydration, a repeat \nCXR was obtained after IVF hydration which was again negative \nfor PNA.  Her cough improved and she was discharged on 2 \nadditional doses of her ___ azithromycin course, as well as an \nalbulterol inhaler for hyperactive airways and a ___ course of \nguafenesein.\n\n#Fatigue:  \nHer fatigue was thought to be more likely ___ and \nrelated to her presentation of cough and chills as well as \ndehydration, as patient has been taking very little PO for the \nlast couple of weeks (particularly less fluid intake).  Her \nacute change overnight was also likely secondary to the codeine \nshe was given over the weekend for her cough which was causing \ntiredness and profound weakness in this ___. TSH was within \nnormal limits. She was rehydrated with NS IVF and her fatigue \nsignificantly improved.\n\n#Anemia: Her baseline Hct in ___ was 32.1, remained stable \n___ at 27. Normocytic anemia, iron studies normal, will \nfollow up with PCP as outpatient.\n\n#HTN: Currently normotensive, held home Losartan\/HCTZ for \ndehydration.  The patient remained normotensive, and if needed, \nmay be started back on Losartan as an outpatient but would be \nhesitant to restart HCTZ given she has poor fluid at baseline \nper family, and the patient presented very dehydrated.\n\n#Hypercholesterolemia:  Continued home simvastatin.\n\nTransitional Issues:\n- f\/u anemia ~27\n- f\/u BP; restart Losartan if needed.

There is no hemorrhage, edema, shift of midline \nstructures, or\nevidence of acute infarction.  The basal cisterns are patent and \ngray-white\nmatter differentiation is preserved.  Post-surgical changes from \nprior right frontoparietal craniotomy are noted.  The visualized \nparanasal sinuses, mastoid air cells, and middle ear cavities \nare clear.\n \nIMPRESSION:\n1.  No acute hemorrhage or mass effect.\n2.  Large area of encephalomalacia in the right frontal lobe at \nthe site of\nmultiple prior resections.\n___ MRI Head w\/ and w\/o contrast:\nThere is a large resection cavity in the right frontal lobe \nwithout\nany nodular enhancement.  The postoperative cavity appears to \nhave minimally increased in size.  There is a right frontal \ncranioplasty.  No fluid collection is noted superficial or deep \nto the cranioplasty.   There are no foci of restricted \ndiffusion.  There is a stable infiltrative signal\nabnormality along the margin of the operative cavity and \nextending into the\ncorpus callosum on the left frontal lobe which could represent \ncombination of post-treatment changes and infiltrative neoplasm. \n No evidence for acute\nischemia or hydrocephalus is seen.There is mild meningeal \nenhancement, which could be postoperative in nature, but this \nshould be correlated with CSF studies.  Ventricles are unchanged \nin size and configuration.\n \nIMPRESSION:  Postoperative changes in the right frontal lobe, \nbut no definite evidence for infection noted.  There is mild \nmeningeal enhancement, which could be postoperative in nature, \nbut this should be correlated with CSF studies. \n___ CXR Portable:  In comparison with study of ___, there \nare substantially lower lung volumes, which may account for much \nof the apparent increase in\ntransverse diameter of the heart.  No evidence of vascular \ncongestion.  There is some retrocardiac opacification medially.  \nIt is unclear how much of this could represent some volume loss \nor even consolidation in the lower lobe and how much could \nmerely be a manifestation of low lung volumes and the supine \nportable technique.  If clinically possible, lateral view would \nbe extremely helpful.\n \nThe right IJ catheter extends to about the level of the \ncavoatrial junction or possibly in the upper portion of the \nright atrium itself.\n___ CXR PA\/Lat:  In comparison with study of ___, the patient \nhas taken a much better inspiration.  Again there is an area of \nincreased opacification in the retrocardiac region with poor \ndefinition of the descending aorta.  Although this could merely \nreflect atelectasis, the possibility of supervening pneumonia \nwould have to be considered in the appropriate clinical setting.\n___ MRI C-spine (patient did not tolerate, stopped early): \nSeverely limited study due to motion artifact.  Although there \nare no findings to suggest epidural abscess, the study must be \nconsidered nondiagnostic.\n\n___: Non-Contrast Head CT\nStatus post right frontal craniectomy and drainage catheter \nplacement in a right frontal post-operative cystic collection \nwith interval decrease in size of a fluid collection. \n\n___: Non-Contrast Head CT\nIncreased size of right frontal postoperative cystic fluid \ncollection from the most recent prior head CT of ___ \nwithout significantly increased mass effect. Status post right \nfrontal craniectomy with unchanged position of drainage \ncatheter.  \n\n___ bilateral lower extremity doppler ultrasound\nIMPRESSION: \nNo evidence of deep vein thrombosis in the either leg. \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ year old female with history of recurrent glioblastoma \npresent with worsening headache, nausea, fevers and vomiting.\n\n#Bacterial Meningitis: Patient with worsening mental status \novernight of admission. Complaining of severe neck pain on \nmorning of ___ with difficulty moving without pain. Unable to \ncooperate for Kernig's and Brudzinski's signs. Spiking fevers to \nlow 100s. LP performed ___ showing very high protein (590) and \nvery low glucose (1). Gram stain showed 4+pmns and 1+ GPCs in \nclusters. ID was consulted for help with antibiotic coverage and \netiology of symptoms and meningitis. Patient was started on \nvancomycin and meropenem for broad coverage. Vancomycin was \nadjusted over several days for goal trough level of ___. \nPatient continued to spike fevers during adjustment period as \ninitial troughs were low. WBC count initially elevated but \nreturned to normal on antibiotics. MRI head with and without \ncontrast was performed ___ which did not show any evidence of \nintracranial abscess to explain ongoing fevers in spite of \nantibiotics. MRI of whole spine attempted ___ given ongoing \nfevers and concern for possible epidural abscess but patient did \ntolerate MRI which was non-diagnostic. Culture of CSF did not \ngrow any organisms in spite of fact that patient was not on \nantibiotics prior to LP. Her mental status waxed and waned with \nperiods of alertness and periods of extreme fatigue and \ndifficulty arousing patient. Narcotic pain meds were held as \nthese seemed to worsen her attention and alertness. Patient's \nfevers subsided on ___. \n\nPatient's parietal lobe incision from ___ was seen to be \nleaking on HD1 with fluctuance anterior to incision at level \nparietal bone. This was thought to be likely source of \nmeningitis given communication of CSF with outside world. She \nwas seen by neurosurgery who oversewed the wound where CSF \nleakage was occuring on ___. Her wound reopened with continued \nleakage on ___ and she was again seen by neurosurgery who \nrecommended she lay on her left side (opposite the incision). \nRevision of surgery was initially held given recent Avastin and \nactive meningitis. \n\nGiven concern for ongoing fevers initially while on broad \nspectrum antibiotics, evaluation of other etiologies were \nperformed. Patient was negative for C diff (had had diarrhea), \nhad no clear pneumonia on CXR, and no evidence of malaria on \nthick and thin smear (given recent trip to ___). \n.\n#Anemia: Patient with baseline anemia w\/ hct of 35. Acute hct \ndrop to 30 on admission but stable during hospital course. No \nevidence of bleeding at site of LP. No other source of bleeding. \nWould benefit from follow-up of Hct as outpatient to make sure \nit is not continuing to trend down. \n.\n# History of recurrent glioblastoma: - s\/p radiation, resection \nand chemotherapy, currently on bevicizumab. Last resection was \non ___. Follow-up MRI in ___ showed multifocal residual tumor \nat the resection margins, including possible subpial \ninvolvement, superiorly, and subependymal involvement, dorsally. \nPatient was continued on keppra for seizure prophylaxis. \nBevicizumab and TTF were held while inpatient. Neurosurgery was \nconsulted as above for leakage from previous incision site over \nright parietal lobe. \n.\n# Hyperlipidemia: Patient was continued on home simvastatin.\n\n# Code Status - FULL\nTransitional Issues:\n[ ] Antibiotic course\n[ ] When to restart Avastin and ___\n\nOn ___, patient was transferred to the ___ and taken to \nthe ___ for revision of incision and R craniectomy. There were no \ncomplications intraoperatively. A drain was placed in the R \nfrontal cyst and skin was closed. Patient was extubated and \ntransferred to the ICU for close monitoring. She is HOB>60 \ndegrees and drain is leveled at 10cmH2O. Head CT was done and \nshowed post-operative changes. The bone flap was sent to \nmicrobiology for culture. Gram staining was unable to be \nperformed secondary to the size of the specimen. \n\nOn ___, she remained neurologically stable. There was scant \ncyst drainage into the drain. ID was consulted and recommended \ncontinuing her antibiotics at the current regimen, Meropenum and \nVancomycin for 3-weeks. Sh was also fit for a helmet. \n\nOn ___ her vancomycin was increased to 1gram q8h per ID \nrecommendations and she was started on salt tabs. Her vancomycin \nwas subsequently changed back to 750mg q8hours later in the day. \nOn ___ her vancomycin trough was 8.3 and he dose was increased \nto 1.5mg q12hours. Her drain was clamped. Her incision remained \ndry and her exam remained stable. \nOn ___ PTT was elevated to 44, SQ heparin was decreased to BID \ndosing. Drain remained clamped. She was written for transferred \nto SDU. \n\nOn ___ we discontinued her drain and transferred to the floor.\n\nOn ___ she was stable. She was screened for rehab.

She did not require behavioral or chemical \nintervention. \n\n#Psychiatric:\n-Psychosis NOS:\nUpon admission, patient stated that she felt \"in a fog\" and has \nbeen\nruminating about the voices that she hears. Patient believed the \ncause of\nthe voices has to do with a re-occurring memory involving a \nfamily gathering in ___ in which she observed other people \n\"getting scared\" and during which she \"passed out.\" She also \nstated that for the last couple months she had been unsure if \nher husband was her real husband or her son was her real son. \n___\nhearing voices of her relatives from ___ that made encouraging \nremarks such as \"be strong\" but also enforced her belief that \nher husband was an impostor.\nEndorsed noncompliance with Lexapro at home, but was compliant \nwith Abilify until she had a nosebleed and was concerned that it \nwas related to this medication. Refused to receive Abilify \nMaintena because she felt she did not need it and\ndid not trust her husband. She was amenable to hospitalization \nin so far as that she believed she \"needed answers\" and does not \nfeel safe to return home. In the context of the last few years \nof depression (low mood, crying spells, anergia, trouble \nfocusing\/concentrating, isolation, social anxieties, sleep \ntrouble), the pt has had intermittent bouts of psychotic \nfeatures.  For example, she often\nfeared that something bad will happen to her mother and brother; \nshe heard voices (they used to be persecutory but now are calm \nand supportive voices); ideas of reference (uses \"creativity\" to \ncope - she explains that she puts music and art together when \nshe gets stressed); she believed her eyeballs were changing \ncolors; pt\nwondered if her family were being kept away from her (i.e. she \nwas paranoid about not hearing from her mother as often as she \nused to). Endorsed SI prior to hospitalization in the setting of \nfeeling \"helpless\" and mistreated by the EMTs that brought her \nto the hospital. Denied SI or HI upon admission. Does not have \nconcerns about her safety on the unit. Continued patient's PO \nabilify in addition to administering Maintena injection on \n___. Pt reported no side effects or adverse events. She \ncontinued to endorse auditory hallucinations and demonstrated \nintermittent loosening of associations, but her reality testing \nslowly improved during admission. Patient hesitant to sign ___ \napplication for home services ___ prominent paranoia, but \nacquiesced as symptoms lessened. Both she and her husband agreed \nthat she would benefit from home based support with her \nmedications. Additionally reinforced with patient the importance \nof engaging in the community and social functions to prevent \nisolation in her psychosis. Arranged for follow-up with \npatient's psychiatrys and therapist, in addition to arranging \npartial hospital program after discharge. Submitted ___ \napplication on ___. Also spoke with husband about future \nconsideration of guardianship, in light of patient's recent \nhospitalizations.\n\n-Alcohol abuse vs dependence: Per collateral, patient had been \ndrinking one bottle of wine daily \"for the past few months\" \nprior to admission. She initially minimized her behavior, but as \nadmission progressed, she attributed most of her interpersonal \ndifficulties to her drinking. Believed that she \"just needed \ndetox\" and \"everything would be okay.\" Patient did not show any \nsigns\/symptoms of alcohol withdrawal during admission. Discussed \nwith patient, in presence of husband, the importance for her to \nstay sober upon discharge. Patient agreed and articulated \nunderstanding\n\n#Medical: There were no acute medical issues addressed during \nthis hospitalization.\n\n#Social\/Milieu: Patient was initially isolative in her room but \nbecame more visible as admission progressed. She attended few \noccupational therapy groups. Was not seen interacting with other \npatients.\n\n#Collateral:\nDr. ___ ___ has seen this patient for about ___. \nStates that Mrs. ___ has always presented as very calm, \nintelligent, and well put together during meetings. She is \"slow \nto open up to providers\" but over time, has revealed\nmany concerning psychotic signs\/sx to Dr. ___. Mrs. ___ has a \nhistory of the following psychotic signs: 1)Paranoia (during \nepisodes of decompensation, she accuses her husband of affairs \nand becomes very worried about his intentions), 2)Bizarre \nBehaviors (husband has reported that the pt will start howling \nand growling at home, while posturing - he has reportedly \nvideotaped some of these events, 3) Hallucinations (pt has long \nreported persecutory auditory hallucinations), 4) Negative sx \n(at times she won't take care of ADLs and displays some pmr). \nShe also commented on patient's increasing alcohol consumption \n(drinking appx 1 bottle of wine per night, although she \ncontinues to minimize this use). Much of the above tends to be \ntriggered by the holidays of ___ when the \npatient travels with her husband to visit much family.  This \ntends to amplify her sx and admissions have often been congruent \nwith this time of year. The patient's family have had to come to \n___ to assist her husband in caring for the patient.  \nReportedly, the mother and brother feel overwhelmed and have now \nchosen to disconnect from the pt because of her behaviors. Mrs. \n___ took Risperdal ___ in the past.  She did very well \nabout ___ year ago, when she did not travel for ___ \n___, supplemented regimen with po Risperdal, and did not \nrequire hospitalization . She was noncompliant, however, with \nRisperdal and chose to take Abilify.  She was also noncompliant \nwith this and had refused Maintena since stopping in ___.\n\nHusband characterized patient as always being somewhat \nrebellious and challenging of those in authority, and patient \nadmitted to transferring some of her struggles with her father \nonto her husband following his death. Articulated awkwardness \nrelationships currently as husband is in the position of \nmonitoring patient's medication compliance and how this serves \nas an imbalance in their relationship. Husband stated that often \ntimes when he is not available or is traveling, patient\nwill discontinue her medications. Patient has also been more \nsensitive to him being away and feeling insecure about what \nhusband may be doing when he is not at home. Asked for referral \nto ___ for home based services.\n\n#Risk Assessment:\nPatient carries several risk factors for self-harm including \nseveral recent hospitalizations for psychotic decompensation ___ \nmedication non-compliance, chronic and severe mental illness, \nalcohol abuse, social isolation, unemployment, marriage strain, \nworsening neurovegetative symptoms, lack of insight and \ntransient suicidal ideation. However, she carries several \nprotective factors including her established relationship with \nher psychiatrist, her supportive husband, lack of suicidal \ngestures in the past, desire to improve relationship with son \nand husband, and help seeking behavior, including willingness to \naccept Abilify Maintena injection and desire to connect with \npsychiatrist and therapist post-discharge.\n\n#Prognosis: \nPatient is at low or intermittent risk of self-harm insofar as \nshe remains medication compliant and engaged in outpatient \ntreatment, which includes regular socialization and activities \noutside of her home. However, if she devolves into her psychosis \nfurther due to non-compliance, she will likely require \nhospitalization. Discussed with patient's husband likelihood of \npursuing guardianship in the future.\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

Possible mild interstitial edema but no \ndefinite consolidations. \n.\nCTA HEAD W&W\/O C & RECONS Study Date of ___ 11:55 AM \nCLINICAL HISTORY: ___ woman with brief aphasia. \nCOMPARISON: CT of the head from ___.  \nTECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial images were obtained through the \nbrain without contrast material. An axial perfusion CT run was \nperformed during the infusion of 110 cc of Omnipaque intravenous \ncontrast. Subsequently, rapid axial imaging was performed from \nthe aortic arch to the brain during infusion of Optiray \nintravenous contrast material. Images were processed on a \nseparate workstation with display of mean transit time, relative \ncerebral blood volume and cerebral blood flow, MAP for the CT \nperfusion study in curved reformats, 3D volume-rendered images \nand maximum-intensity projection images for the CTA. \nFINDINGS: \nNON CONTRAST HEAD CT: There is no evidence of hemorrhage, mass \neffect, edema, infarction or shift of the normally midline \nstructures. Ventricles and sulci are normal in caliber and \nconfiguration. No fractures are identified. \nCT PERFUSION: The brain perfusion appears normal with no \nevidence of delayed transit time, reduced blood flow or blood \nvolume. \nHEAD AND NECK CTA: There is mild calcification and significant \ntortuosity of the great vessels. There is medialization of both \ninternal common carotid arteries. There is no significant \nstenosis of the internal carotid arteries, with the left \ninternal common carotid measuring 4.3 mm distally and 4.7 mm \nproximally and the right internal common carotid measuring 4.3 \nmm distally and 4.2 mm proximally. Tandem plaques are seen \nscattered throughout the internal common carotid. A hypoplastic \nleft posterior communicating artery is noted. There is a \ndominant left vertebral artery. There is no evidence of aneurysm \nformation.  \nMultilevel degenerative joint disease is seen, most prominent at \nC4, C5, C6. Calcification of the tracheal rings is noted.  \nCONCLUSION. \n1. No acute intracranial process. \n2. No significant perfusion abnormalities. \n3. Tortuosity of the great vessels along with medialization of \nboth internal common carotids, possibly congenital or due to \natherosclerosis. \n4. Multilevel degenerative disk disease. \n.\nMicrobiology:\nBlood Cultures are pending\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nThis is a ___ year old right handed woman with a history of of \nType II DM on low dose insulin, aortic stenosis, severe OA, ESRD \non HD (q TuThSa), chronic SC vein thrombosis (secondary to \nlines) on coumadin, multiple HD line infections, who developed \ndysarthria and left sided weakness during dialysis on ___.\n\nACTIVE ISSUES:\n# Altered Mental Status\/dysarthria and left sided weakness: The \npatient was taken to the Emergency department and a stroke code \nwas called. Her work up was not concerning for an acute \nintracranial process.  Her left sided weaknesses was resolved \nwhen seen on the floor, although she was still slurring her \nspeech and confused compared to her baseline. The differential \nincluded a toxic\/metabolic vs infectious vs hypoperfusion of the \nbrain.  Given that this happened while she was on HD, and that \nthis is reminiscent of her recent presentation and admission, it \nseems likely that hypoperfusion secondary to hypotension during \ndialysis is the likely cause of her altered mental status. She \nhas known Aortic stenosis, calcifications found throughout her \ncarotids on CT, and a known history of subclavian thrombosis. \nShe is no longer taking clonidine for HTN and was still on her \nlisinopril.  She takes lisinopril on HD days, and in the setting \nof her delicate blood pressures, this could have precipitated a \ntransient cerebral ischemia in the watershed areas.  \n\nInfection was also considered although she has not exhibited a \nfever or mounted a white count. Her LFTs are wnl. She also does \nnot exhibit any signs or symptoms of an infectious process. She \nhas a recent history of a yeast infection, however this is \nunlikely to cause global mental status changes unless she is \nfungemic. She could also have a toxic\/metabolic process, given \nthat she had asterixis on exam. However her electrolytes were at \nher baseline. \n\nNeurologically, though there was no evidence of an obvious \nstroke on Head CT\/A she also could have had a TIA given report \nof focal neurodeficit. She has vessel disease (CAD, DM2, and \ncarotid calcifications). An MRI would better characterize \nlesions, but she cannot get gadolidium due to her renal \nfunction. Per neuro recs: If patient has a return of more focal \nsymptoms that do not resolve with improvement in her blood \npressure, can consider MRI for infarct\/PRES, but no clear \nindication to do so now.\n.\nWe held her blood pressure medication (lisinopril) and other \nsedating medications (gapapentin and clonazepam). The morning on \n___, she was more lucid and at her baseline according to her \nprimary care physician and her systolic blood pressures were in \nthe 100s.\n.  \nINACTIVE ISSUES:\n# Subclavian thrombosis-her INR trended from 1.6-->1.9->2.4. We \ncontinued home dose of warfarin at 3mg qd, and did not start IV \nHeparin.\n.  \n# Right shoulder pain- likely due to degenerative disease and \nunderlying renal osteodystrophy and osteoarthritis given her \nobese body habitus. She was given tylenol for pain control and \nwe avoided NSAIDs given her history of H Pylori.\n.  \n# CAD - She had no chest pain, and her EKG was congruent with \nher baseline.

You were confused, had report of weakness on the left side of your body, and you were sent the ___ Emergency department. They thought that you might have had a stroke, but found that you didn't have evidence of this on a head CT, a strong Xray picture of your brain. You were sent to the medical team to watch monitor your mental status. Your electrolytes were normal for you and you did not seem to have an infection, thus we believe that this episode was caused by hypotension (low blood pressure) which delivered less blood to your brain and caused you to have your symptoms of confusion and slurred speech. Your left sided weakness had resolved by the time you came to the medicine floor. Your mental status improved with your blood pressure and by the time you left you were at your normal self. In recent times, it does not seem that you have hypertension (high blood pressure) and now it seems that you have hypotension(low blood pressure), so we recommend stopping your anti-hypertension medication (lisinopril) because that may be contributing to ___ hypotension(low blood pressure)."}

There is also extension \ninto and obliteration of the left C7-T1 and T1-T2 neural \nforamens.  Its appearance, including partial encasement of the \ncord, heavily favors lymphoma or leukemia. Meningioma is also on \nthe differential, although somewhat atypical in this case given \nless avid enhancement compared to the surrounding meninges. \nNeuroblastoma is unlikely in this age group. \n2.  Mild degenerative changes in the cervical and lumbar spine, \nmost prominent at L5-S1 where there is disc bulging\/superimposed \ncentral protrusion without critical spinal canal narrowing at \nthis level. \nNOTIFICATION:  Preliminary findings were telephoned to Dr. ___ \n___ by ___ on ___ at 12:59PM, at time of discovery. \n\nCT Chest (___): IMPRESSION:\nMinimal bilateral pleural effusion, probably not clinically \nsignificant.

The patient remains in a \nwheelchair or bedbound, with baseline incontinence of both urine \nand stool. The patient had never received any neuraxial imaging \nwhile in ___. Imaging upon admission was remarkable for a 4.3 \nx 1.1cm homogeneously enhancing extradural spinal canal mass \nextending from C7-T3, compressing the spinal cord at those \nlevels. The differential diagnosis for the mass included \nSchwannoma, meningioma, lymphoma, among others. Neurology, \nNeurosurgery, and orthopedic spine services were consulted for \nfurther evaluation and attempt to biopsy the lesion. \nHematology\/oncology provided recommendations for further \nevaluation and instructions regarding biopsy preparation for \npathology. The patient was transferred to the neurology service \nfor further evaluation. Attempt was made to coordinate a biopsy \nof her spinal canal mass with Neurosurgery and Spine surgery in \na combined surgery, but the patient preferred to wait and make a \ndecision as an outpatient for biopsy and further management. \nBaclofen was started prior to discharge for her spasticity.\n\n#Abdominal pain: \nThe patient presented with a history of chronic abdominal pain, \nwhich was worse when patient's lower extremity spasms worsened. \nA CT abdomen\/pelvis demonstrated simple fluid collection in the \nvagina; hCG was negative. OB\/GYN was consulted, and it was felt \nthat this fluid was not contributing to the patient's abdominal \npain, and that a speculum examination should be performed when \nthe patient's spasticity improves to the degree that examination \ncould be conducted. The patient's abdominal pain was attributed \nto cervical\/thoracic cord compression leading to spasticity of \nthe abdominal muscles. The patient's abdominal pain improved \nthroughout her hospital stay. \n\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

This corresponds to an area of hypodensity seen on \nthe CT scan, \nand this area is bright on the FLAIR images.  In addition, there \nis a small \nfocus of slow diffusion in the right posterior frontal lobe.  \nThis is also \nseen on FLAIR images, and also suggests subacute infarction.  \nThere is no \nevidence of hemorrhage.  There are no other findings to suggest \ninfarction.  \nThe FLAIR images demonstrate extensive periventricular white \nmatter \nhyperintensity suggesting chronic small vessel ischemia. \n  \nThe intracranial MRA demonstrates narrowing and irregularity of \nthe M1 segment \nof the right middle cerebral artery and narrowing and \nirregularity of the \nposterior cerebral arteries bilaterally.  There are also \nsuggestions of \nsimilar changes in the M2 branches of the middle cerebral \narteries \nbilaterally.  These findings are likely due to atherosclerotic \ndisease. \n  \nThe MRA of the neck demonstrates a normal appearance of the \nvertebral \narteries.  The origins of the great vessels appear normal, and \nthe common, \ninternal, and external carotid arteries appear normal.  There is \nno evidence \nof internal carotid artery stenosis by NASCET criteria. \n  \nCONCLUSION:  Bilateral supratentorial subacute infarction \nwithout evidence of \nhemorrhage. \n  \nIntracranial vascular narrowing suggesting atherosclerotic \ndisease. \n  \nCervical MRA demonstrates no significant abnormalities. \nRight Wrist x ray: There is generalized demineralization.  There \nare no signs for acute fractures \nor dislocations.  There are moderate-to-severe degenerative \nchanges of the \nfirst CMC and triscaphe joints.  No bony erosions are seen.  On \nthe lateral \nview, there is a dystrophic calcification in the posterior \naspect of the \nradiocarpal joint, which may represent sequela of prior old \ntrauma. \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nThis is a ___ yo. w\/recent CVA in ___ with residual moderate to \nsevere right arm weakness & pain as well as speech difficulties, \nrecently on ___ discharged to rehab from cardiology service \nafter PCI for NSTEMI, also with HTN, dyslipidemia, diastolic \nCHF, who presents with worsening of her right-sided weakness and \nworsening dysarthria and more confusion as well as severe pain \nin her right arm, mostly in her right\nwrist.  \n\n1.

His EKG at the time of admit demonstrated \nAV-dissociation with a ventricular rate of 40, and this has been \nat least intermittently occurring since ___. Cardiology \nmentions that based on the morphology of the ventricular escape \nrhythm, it appears to be in the nodal region and appears to be \nstable. The source of the nodal dysfunction is likely due to his \nprior ischemic cardiomyopathy or structural heart disease or \nfibrosis of the conduction system. Enhanced vagal tone is \nanother consideration, as are medications that interfere with \nnodal conduction, however, he presents on no AV-nodal blockers. \nHe appears hemodynamically stable on admission. His troponins \nincreased from baseline transiently and were trending down at \nthe time of discharge. Cardiology was unconcerendd and he is \nthought to be at baseline. Cardiology was consulted during this \nadmission  and they have no plans for any pacemaker placement \ngiven his overall state of health, and current infection and \nrisk of infection of the pace maker. Thyroid function tests were \nobtained and were normal. He remained hemodynamically stable \nthroughout his MICU stay and tolerated bradycardia into the low \n___.  \n-avoid QT prolongation medications\n-optimize electrolytes\n\n# URINARY TRACT INFECTION - Asymptomatic and already on \nCeftriaxone for his epidural abscess treatment.\n\n# PROLONGED QTC - Patient presents with evidence of QTc of 560 \nmsec. Previously has been in the 450-500 msec range per recent \nEKGs. His Seroquel was discontinued given QTc concerns. In \ndiscussions with the patient it was decided to discontinue his \nfluoxetine as well as he felt that this wasn't necessary at this \ntime given its potential for Qtc prolongation. It is critical \nthat his Qtc be controlled in the setting of his complete heart \nblock to prevent Torsades.\n-aboid QT prolonging medications\n-Stopped seroquel\n-stopped fluoxetine\n.\n# EPIDURAL ABSCESS AND T9 OSTEOMYELITIS - Came in from rehab on \nantibiotics.

Cardiology was \naware and had no acute concerns for active coronary ischemia at \nthis point. While in the MICU he was continued asprinm, \nClopidogrel, and hisstatin medications. He was maintained on \ntelemetry\n\n# DECUBITUS, SACRAL ULCER - this was present on admission\n-on ceftriaxone for his epidural abscess\n-wound care was following\n\n# CHRONIC RENAL INSUFFICIENCY - Evidence of possible chronic \nkidney disease.  Will con't Furosemide 40 mg PO QHS with good \nurine output.  His Cr stayed stable and nephrotoxins were \navoided and medications were renally dosed.  \n\n# CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE - On admission exam and chest xray do \nnot demonstrate significant volume overload. He will likely \nbenfit from an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor given \nrenal insufficiency. Continued furosemide 40 mg PO each day. \nAV-nodal blockers were avoided given AV-dissociation concerns. \nWhile in the MICU daily weights, strict ins and outs were \nobtained.\n\n# CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE - Evidence of COPD and \nstable on inhalers and nebulizers with home oxygen requirement. \nNo evidence of acute exacerbation, stable oxygen requirement and \nno wheezing on exam. While in the MICU we maintained oxygen \nsupplementation, as needed. Albuterol and ipratropium nebulizers \nwere given as needed, and we continued his fluticasone and \ntiotropium as well as incentive spirometry.\n\n# OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP APNEA - Patient has required continuous \npositive airway pressure (CPAP) at home and this has been \ncontinued on recent admissions with oxygen saturations in the \nhigh ___.

No thrombus\/mass is seen in \nthe body of the left atrium (best excluded by TEE). The right \natrium is markedly enlarged. There is no evidence for an atrial \nseptal defect by 2D\/color Doppler. The estimated right atrial \npressure is ___ mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular \nhypertrophy with a normal cavity size. There is normal regional \nand global left ventricular systolic function. Quantitative \nbiplane left ventricular ejection fraction is 56 % (normal \n54-73%). Left ventricular cardiac index is normal (>2.5 \nL\/min\/m2). There is no resting left ventricular outflow tract \ngradient. Mildly dilated right ventricular cavity with normal \nfree wall motion. Tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion \n(TAPSE) is normal. Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function \nis likely lower due to the severity of tricuspid regurgitation. \nThe aortic sinus diameter is normal for gender with a normal \nascending aorta diameter for gender. The aortic arch diameter is \nnormal. There is no evidence for an aortic arch coarctation. The \naortic valve leaflets (3) are moderately thickened. There is \nmoderate aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.0-1.5 cm2). There \nis trace aortic regurgitation. There is a bileaflet mechanical \nmitral valve prosthesis. The prosthesis is well-seated, with \nnormal disc motion and high normal mean gradient. There is mild \n[1+] mitral regurgitation. Due to acoustic shadowing, the \nseverity of mitral regurgitation could be UNDERestimated. The \npulmonic valve leaflets are normal. The tricuspid valve leaflets \nappear structurally normal. There is moderate to severe [3+] \ntricuspid regurgitation. There is moderate to severe pulmonary \nartery systolic hypertension. In the setting of at least \nmoderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, the pulmonary artery \nsystolic pressure may be UNDERestimated. There is no pericardial \neffusion.\n\nIMPRESSION: Moderate aortic valve stenosis with \nthickened\/deformed leaflets and trace aortic regurgitation. Well \nseated, normal functioning bileaflet mitral valve prosthesis \nwith high normal gradient and ?mild mitral regurgitation. \nModerate to severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Mild \nsymmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size \nand regional\/global systolic function. Right ventricular cavity \ndilation with preserved free wall motion.\n\nCXR ___\nIn comparison with the study of ___, there is little \noverall change.  Again there is prominent globular enlargement \nof the cardiac silhouette with only mild vascular congestion in \nthis patient with mitral valve replacement. The opacification at \nthe right base with obscuration of the hemidiaphragm appears \nmore prominent, suggesting some re-accumulation of hemothorax.  \nOtherwise, little change. \n\nCXR PA and Lat ___\nIn comparison with the study of ___.

S\/p\nR-sided chest tube placement by thoracic surgery that was \nremoved\n___. Repeat imaging with stable RP hematoma and improvement in\nnow small, R-sided pleural effusion, which appeared simple on\nmultiple ultrasounds by IP. In discussion with cardiology, home\nASA 81mg was discontinued in setting of spontaneous bleed. Home\nINR goal was narrowed from 2.5-3.5 to 2.5-3.0 for mechanical\nmitral valve. Anticoagulation was resumed without e\/o recurrent\nbleeding, and she will be discharged on lovenox bridge to\ncoumadin for an INR of 2.0 on discharge. She will require daily\nINRs and lovenox bridging until INR is >2.5 x 48h.\nAnticoagulation management to be assumed by PCP after rehab\ndischarge. Hgb 8.7 on discharge. Would repeat short-interval CXR\nto document resolution of pleural effusion.\n\n# Acute calculous cholecystitis s\/p percutaneous cholecystostomy\ntube:\n# Choledocholithasis: \nDeveloped new leukocytosis and RUQ pain this admission with\nhyperbilirubinemia, found to have acute cholecystitis on CT \ntorso\n___.

PTBD \nplacement\nwas not thought necessary. ID consulted for bile cx growing\n___, thought to be a contaminant and not treated. She was\ntreated with CTX\/flagyl for two separate courses given transient\nreturn of leukocytosis. CT abdomen ___ showed possible \ninterval\nbleeding into a fluid collection around the gallbladder, raising\nc\/f for a potential fistula between the gallbladder and\ntransverse colon or second part of the duodenum, ultimately\nthought unlikely given her rapid improvement and stability. She\nwill be discharged with perc chole in place with plan for ACS \nf\/u\non ___ with Dr. ___ to determine whether CCY will be\nperformed. If she is not deemed a surgical candidate, will need \na\ndrain study with ___ to determine whether perc chole can be\nremoved.

Repeat TTE showed mild\nsymmetric LVH with EF 56%, mod AS, well-seated MV prosthesis \nwith\nhigh-normal gradient, mod-severe TR, and mod-severe pHTN.\nCardiology was consulted and recommended diuresis. She was\ndiuresed with IV Lasix to well-below her reported dry weight of\n145-150lbs, and was thought to be euvolemic at 136.9 lbs at\ndischarge. Home Lasix 40mg daily was resumed to maintain\neuvolemia. Spironolactone was trialed, discontinued for softer\nBPs and deferred to outpatient cardiologist. There was no e\/o\nacute COPD exacerbation, and home Incruse Ellipta, Symbicort, \nand\nalbuterol were continued at the time of discharge. She continued\nto require ___ NC at rest and ___ with exertion at the time of\ndischarge. This O2 requirement was ultimately attributed to her\nunderlying COPD and atelectasis, with small residual R-sided\npleural effusion not thought explanatory, and she was discharged\nto rehab on O2. She has been scheduled for pulmonary f\/u on\n___ cardiology f\/u pending at discharge. Would likely benefit\nfrom pulmonary rehab after rehab discharge.\n\n# Mechanical mitral valve (goal INR 2.5-3):\n# Atrial fibrillation:\nHx mechanical mitral valve, for which she is on coumadin.

As above, her INR goal was narrowed to\n___ in setting of spontaneous RP hematoma and hemothorax. She\nwas treated with heparin gtt and coumadin this admission and \nwill\nbe discharged on lovenox bridge to coumadin for an INR of 2.0 on\ndischarge. She will require daily INRs and lovenox bridging \nuntil\nINR is >2.5 x 48h. Anticoagulation management to be assumed by\nPCP after rehab discharge. \n\n# Enterococcal cystitis:\nDeveloped dysuria without systemic symptoms on ___. Received \nCTX\nwith resolution of symptoms, but UCx ultimately grew VRE. Given\nher mechanical valve and risk for infection, she was treated \nwith\nfosfomycin x 1 prior to discharge, which should be adequate\ntherapy per ID curbside.\n\n# Hypertension:\nContinued home diltiazem.\n\n# HLD: \nContinued home atorvastatin. \n\n# Depression: \nContinued home venlafaxine.\n\n# Overactive Bladder: \nOutpatient fesoterodine was non-formulary so was switched to\ntolterodine while inpatient. \n\n# Microscopic hematuria:\nWill need repeat UA as outpatient to document resolution.\n\nCONTACT: ___ ___\nCODE: Full (confirmed) \n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES\n===================\n[] Discharge Weight: 62.1 kg (136.9 lb) \n[] Discharge Cr: 0.6\n\n[] Drain management:\n - Monitor drain output daily.

This seemed to help\nsomewhat, although he continued to have some rhythmic eye\nmovements so he was then given an additional 2mg IV ativan as\nwell as 1g Keppra. The abnormal movements stopped but he \nremained\naltered and there was concern he was obstructing his airway and\nretaining CO2. He was therefore intubated and  started on\npropofol for sedation. It was reportedly a difficult intubation\nrequiring multiple attempts, and he also had to be paralyzed \nwith\nrocuronium afterward due to persistent biting on the tube \ndespite\nsedation. He was then transferred to ___ for further\nmanagement.\n\nCurrently he is intubated and sedated on propofol. No family is\ncurrently available for collateral information.\n\nOf note, he was recently admitted to the neurology service in\n___ for increased seizure frequency and confusion. EEG\nshowed mildly slow backgroun in addition to right sided slowing\nbut no epileptiform features and no seizures were captured.\nToxic\/metabolic work-up was negative and he quickly returned to\nhis baseline. His seizures were thought to be related to\nincreased stress at home and poor sleep. He denied missing any\nmedication doses and AED trough levels were therapeutic.

No acute intracranial abnormalities. \n2. Chronic infarcts with encephalomalacia in the right frontal, \nparietal, and occipital lobes. \n\n___ CXR\nCompared to prior radiograph from earlier the same date, a left \ninternal \njugular catheter has been placed, terminating in the mid \nsuperior vena cava, with no pneumothorax.  Exam is otherwise \nsimilar to the recent study except for improving linear \nbibasilar atelectasis. \n\n___ ECHO\nThe left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. \nThere is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal \ncavity size. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall \nmotion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. There is mild to \nmoderate global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 35-40 %). \nThe aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic \nvalve leaflets (?#) appear structurally normal with good leaflet \nexcursion. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic \nvalve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image \nquality. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic \nregurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly \nthickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. No masses or \nvegetations are seen on the mitral valve, but cannot be fully \nexcluded due to suboptimal image quality. No masses or \nvegetations are seen on the tricuspid valve, but cannot be fully \nexcluded due to suboptimal image quality. The pulmonary artery \nsystolic pressure could not be determined. No masses or \nvegetations are seen on the pulmonic valve, but cannot be fully \nexcluded due to suboptimal image quality. There is an anterior \nspace which most likely represents a prominent fat pad. \n\n Suboptimal image quality. No echocardiographic evidence of \npathologic flow. Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) \nof ___, left ventricular function appears less vigorous.  \n\n___ CTA ABDOMEN\/PELVIS\n1. No intraluminal IV contrast extravasation into the large or \nsmall bowel.  No abdominopelvic hematoma. \n2. Sigmoid and descending colonic diverticulosis. \n3. Heterogeneous micronodular consolidation at the right lung \nbase may \nrepresent sequela of aspiration or pneumonia. \n4. Intraluminal filling defect at the aortic bifurcation \nassociated with \ncalcified atherosclerotic plaque, extending into the origin of \nthe left common iliac artery, has the appearance of noncalcified \natheroma.  This results in moderate to severe narrowing of the \nluminal diameter of the infrarenal abdominal aorta as well as \nthe origin of the left common iliac artery. \n5. Intraluminal filling defect of the right profunda femoral \nartery extending into its branches, associated with calcified \nplaque, also likely representing arterial atheroma.  This \nresults in moderate to severe narrowing of the arterial lumen. \n\n___ LEFT FOOT X-RAY (POST-AMPUTATIONS)\nStatus post transmetatarsal amputation of all digits of the left \nfoot.  There are sharp surgical margins.  An overlying surgical \ndrain is noted.  There is soft tissue swelling and air. \n\n___ TEE\nDynamic interatrial septum. No atrial septal defect is seen by \n2D or color Doppler. Right ventricular chamber size and free \nwall motion are normal. The ascending, transverse and descending \nthoracic aorta are normal in diameter and free of \natherosclerotic plaque to 35 cm from the incisors. The aortic \nvalve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet \nexcursion. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic \nvalve. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve \nleaflets are mildly thickened. No mass or vegetation is seen on \nthe mitral valve. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is \nno pericardial effusion. \n\n IMPRESSION: No evidence of valvular vegetation, abscess or \nsignificant regurgitation. Normal biventricular systolic \nfunction.  \n\n___ EGD\nFindings: \nEsophagus: Normal esophagus. \nStomach:  Mucosa: Erythema of the mucosa was noted in the \nantrum. Cold forceps biopsies were performed for histology to \nevaluate for H.pylori.  \n Excavated Lesions A 4mm clean based ulcer was seen in the \npylorus.  \nDuodenum:  Excavated Lesions Multiple clean based ulcers ranging \nin size from 4 mm to 8 mm were found in the second part of the \nduodenum.  \nImpression: Ulcer in the pylorus\nUlcers in the duodenum\nErythema in the antrum (biopsy)\nOtherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ gentleman with past medical history significant for \npoorly controlled diabetes, CKD, CAD (NSTEMI with DES to LAD and \nLCx in ___, HLD, and ongoing osteomyelitis of his left foot \nwho presented to the ___ ED with altered mental status and \ndiabetic ketoacidosis, subsequently found to have acute blood \nloss anemia from GI bleed.\n\n========================\nACTIVE ISSUES:\n========================\n\n#) Acute blood loss anemia: The patient was initially admitted \nto the ___ ICU. He was then transferred to a ___ \ngeneral medicine floor in preparation for TMA for osteomyelitis \nas below. However on the morning of transfer, he was noted to \nhave a large maroon colored stool, estimated to be 500-1000cc in \nvolume associated with an 8-point drop in hematocrit and \nhypotension to the SBP ___. He was subsequently transferred to \nthe MICU. He was transfused 6 units pRBCs and 1 unit FFP. NG \nlavage was negative. He then began to have hematemesis; it was \nunclear whether this was due to upper GI bleed or trauma related \nto the NG lavage. The patient continued to pass clots per \nrectum, but he remained hemodynamically stable. He was evaluated \nby Gastroenterology, who recommended upper and lower endoscopy. \nThe patient underwent EGD which showed ulcers of the pylorus and \nduodenum.  Colonoscopy was attempted but bowel prep was poor.  \nHowever, GI felt that the most likely source of his bleed were \nthe ulcers seen on EGD.  He will require repeat EGD in 8 weeks \npost-discharge; GI clinic at ___ to coordinate.  H. pylori \nbiopsies pending. \n\n#) Diabetic ketoacidosis: Patient presented with serum glucose \nof >700, anion gap of 31, and venous blood gas with pH of 7.29. \nKetones present in the urine. Precipitant likely a GI source \ngiven vomiting in the days preceding admission and mild \nabdominal tenderness on initial exam. Urine and CXR without sign \nof infection, LFTs unremarkable, and initial troponin negative. \nDKA resolved with insulin and IVF, and patient was restarted on \nLantus w\/ ___. Precipitant likely infection.   Patient \ndischarged on Lantus 18u BID.\n\n#) Osteomyelitis: WBC of 18k on admission, with 90% neutrophils. \nBlood cultures grew back MSSA. Most likely related to \nosteomyelitis in foot. History of osteomyelitis of the left \nfoot, with initial ___ admission from ___. Patient \ntreated with nafcillin, and is scheduled to go to the OR for \namputation of his foot. Additionally, there was concern for \naspiration based on patient's symptoms and bibasilar opacities \non CXR; patient was evaluated by speech and swallow, and made \nNPO to prevent further aspiration events. TTE and TEE \ndemonstrated no valvular vegetations.\n\n#) Altered mental status: Resolved.  atient noted to be altered \non day of admission, and was AOx2 on arrival to the ___. CT \nhead in ED was negative for acute changes. Altered status is \nlikely due to toxic-metabolic derangement in the setting of DKA, \nvs changes related to infection. \n\n#) Acute on chronic kidney disease: Serum creatinine was 0.9-1.1 \nas recent as ___ but then 1.4 in ___ as outpatient. Cr \nelevated at 3.8 on presentation, likely due to hypovolemia in \nthe setting of DKA (with history of recent vomiting, Hbg\/Hct \nalso with hemoconcentration). Creatinine improved with fluid \nrescuscitation, suggesting prerenal etiology. \n\n#) Nutrition.  Patient noted to have significant dysphagia while \nin ICU.  Patient was evaluated by S&S multiple times and \nultimately liberalized to thin liquids\/ground solids diet at \ndiet.  \n\n#) Atrial fibrillation: seen on EKG.

However, trop negx1, no EKG \nchanges, and her chest wall and paravertebral cervical soft \ntissue were tender to palpation, which is most consistent with a \nnon-cardiac musculoskeletal etiology of her pain. The patient \nwas afebrile and had no leukocytosis, and had been on chronic \nantibiotics, making infection less likely.  Her chest CT imaging \nfrom an OSH showed sequela of septic emboli from prior \nendocarditis that were actually improved on more recent imaging. \nTTE showed improving tricuspid valve function with a diminished \nsize of the abnormality, reduced regurgitation, and density \nconsistent with healing tissue. The patient reported her last \nIVDU was prior to her prior hospitalization. Urine and blood \ntoxicology screens were negative. For pain control, the patient \nwas given ibuprofen, acetaminophen and hydromorphone; at \ndischarge these medications were continued, albeit at lower \ndoses.  She has PCP and ID ___.\n\n#Knee Pain: The pain is of unclear etiology, and began after her \nknee and ankle became acutely swollen >1month ago. At that time, \nshe reports her joint was tapped (no information from OMR or \npatient).  She denies trauma.  There is medial joint line \ntenderness with full range of motion, and exam was suggestive of \na medial meniscus tear or medial ligamentous injury.  An MRI was \nperformed on the left knee before discharge, and the patient \nwill require further evaluation as an outpatient.  Report \npending at the time of discharge.\n\n# Vaginal Discharge: The patient complained of thick, white \ndischarge and vaginal irritation consistent with vulvovaginal \ncandidiasis during the hospitalization. Endogenous flora could \nhave been compromised from prior antibiotic use. She denied \ndysuria, and a UA was negative for bacteria or inflammation. \nIrritation resolved after Fluconazole 200 mg was given once.\n\n# History of IV drug use: patient reports last use was prior to \nprevious hospitalization, and toxicology screens were negative.  \nShe was seen by social work, who provided her with a list of \nresources to help her remain sober.\n\n# Nausea: The patient was nauseous before admission and on \nhospital day 2.

Non-small cell lung cancer\n\nONCOLOGY HISTORY: Mr. ___ is a ___ year-old ___ \nmale former smoker (50 pack-years) who presented to medical care \nin ___ with subacute worsening of shortness of \nbreath and cough productive of purulent sputum. He also had low \ngrade fevers. He denied prior cardio-pulmonary complaints or \nconstitutional symptoms. At the time of admission he was quite \nhypoxemic on room air and required supplemental oxygenation. He \nwas admitted to ___ from ___ to ___ for evaluation. \nImaging studies with CT chest from ___ disclosed a \nconsolidation of the lingula, bronchial narrowing, mediastinal \nlymphadenopathy, liver hypodense lesions and a large loculated \nleft pleural effusion. A PET\/CT Scan from ___ disclosed the \npresence of an extensive FDG-avid consolidative process in the \nlingula, lymphangitic carcinomatosis, non-FDG avid pleural\neffusion, FDG-avid lymphadenopathy involving the bilateral \nsupraclavicular regions, mediastinum, subcarinal stations, hilar \nportacaval and retroperiotenal nodes. FDG-avid liver lesions and \nFDG-avid osseous metastases. Head MRI from ___ did not \ndisclose evidence of lesions. The patient was symptomatically \ntreated with antibiotics (completed a course of cefpodoxime - 14 \ndays), supplemental oxygen and a left-sided thoracentesis. The \npatient reported significant improvement of his cardio-pulmonary \nfunction with the pleural drainage. The malignant pleural fluid \nremoved on ___ disclosed a carcinoma. Immunohistochemical \nstains of the tumor cells were positive for CK5\/6, and CK7; and \nnegative for CK20, p63, and TTF-1. This immunoprofile is \nnonspecific but compatible with a non-small-cell lung cancer not \notherwise specified. Since his inpatient discharge, the \npatient's condition has slowly deteriorated. His dyspnea with \nexertion has worsened since his diagnosis. His cough is present \nbut w\/o significant sputum production. He is no longer smoking. \nHe denies much in the way of chest pain. A PleurX catheter was \nrecently placed to manage his chronic left pleural effusion.\n \nSocial History:\n___\nFamily History:\nFather with a stroke; mother with cancer; sister with diabetes, \nhypertension.\n \nPhysical Exam:\nADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAM:\nVS: T 98.5  bp 123\/78  HR 96 RR 20  ___ NC  Wt 160 lbs  \nGEN: NAD, awake, alert  \nHEENT: EOMI, sclera anicteric, conjunctivae clear, OP dry and \nwithout lesion\nNECK: Supple  \nCV: Reg rate, normal S1, S2.

Chronic \nloss of height in the C3 through C6 vertebrae.  Moderate loss of \ndisc height, bridging anterior osteophytes, and mild \nuncovertebral\/facet joint hypertrophy throughout the cervical \nspine.  Broad-based disc osteophyte complexes are mild at C2-3, \nlarge at C3-4, and moderate at C4-5, C5-6, and C6-7.  These \nmarkedly efface the ventral thecal sac and obliterate the dorsal \nCSF space.  There is mild left neural foraminal narrowing at \nC4-5 on the left, and moderate narrowing at C5-6 on the left.  \nAnterior osteophytes impinge on the esophagus. Visualized \nposterior fossa demonstrates atrophy.  Mastoid air cells, middle \near cavities, and maxillary sinuses are clear.  Note is made of \nright palatine tonsillith.  Retained secretions in the \noropharynx.  Thyroid gland is heterogeneous.  Calcifications of \nthe bilateral carotid artery bifurcations. No pathologically \nenlarged cervical lymph nodes.  Moderate \ncentrilobular\/paraseptal emphysema and pleuroparenchymal \nscarring at the lung apices.  Chronic left pleural thickening \nand effusion, better evaluated on accompanying chest CT. \nIMPRESSION:  No fractures.  Severe degenerative disease with \nthecal sac compression at all levels, particularly C3-4 and \nC4-5.\n\nCT HEAD ___\nFINDINGS:  No intracranial hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or \nvascular\nterritorial infarct.  Ventricles and sulci are prominent, \ncompatible with\nage-related involutional changes.  Periventricular and \nsubcortical white\nmatter hypodensities reflect small vessel ischemic disease.  \nCalcifications in the cavernous carotid and basilar arteries.  \nNo shift of the normally midline structures. Non-displaced nasal \nbone fractures (___), with mild overlying soft tissue \nswelling.  There is also minimally displaced fracture of the \nright lamina papyracea (3:10), with overlying focus of gas.  6 \nmm right frontal subgaleal hematoma and mild left frontal scalp \nswelling.  Mastoid air cells and middle ear cavities are clear.\nIMPRESSION: 1. Small subgaleal hematoma.  No intracranial \nhemorrhage. 2.  Non-displaced left nasal and right lamina \npapyracea fractures. ATTENDING NOTE: The fractures described are \nof undetermined age. \n\nCT CHEST ___\nIMPRESSION:\n1. Lingular mass with post-obstructive pneumonitis, \nperibronchovascular and possible lymphangitic spread.\n2. Extensive left pleural and pericardial invasion, with chronic \neffusions.\n3. Innumerable nodal, liver, and osseous metastases.\n4. Right middle lobe inflammation or early infection.\n5. Innumerable osseous metastases, without pathologic fracture.\n\nR SHOULDER XR ___\nRIGHT SHOULDER, AP INTERNAL\/EXTERNAL ROTATION, Y, AND AXILLARY \nVIEWS:  There is an oblique linear lucency along the \nmid-to-distal medial humeral shaft, likely a nutrient foramen. \nMildly prominent deltoid tuberosity.  No\ndislocation. Mild glenohumeral joint space narrowing.  Mild \ncromioclavicular joint spurring.  Right elbow joint is grossly \nnormal.  The right lung apex is unremarkable. IMPRESSION: Mild \ndegenerative changes of the right shoulder.\n\nBILATERAL HIP XR ___\nThere is no evidence of fracture.  Moderate right and mild left \ndegenerative changes are seen with osteophytes, sclerosis of \njoint surfaces, and decrease in the joint space.  There are \nvascular calcifications.  There are surgical clips in the left \npelvis.\n\nMR HEAD ___\nFINDINGS:  The study is compared with the recent NECT dated \n___, and\n(motion-degraded) enhanced MR examination dated ___.  \nThere is\nsignificant image distortion of the diffusion-weighted sequence, \nparticularly at the vertex and a second acquisition is even \nfurther degraded, for unclear reasons (with no additional \nnotation by the MR technologist). Allowing for this artifactual \nlimitation, and comparing the two acquisitions, there is no \ndefinite focus of slow diffusion to suggest acute ischemia.  The \nprincipal intracranial vascular flow voids, including those of \nthe dural venous sinuses are preserved, and these structures \nenhance normally. Again demonstrated is both discrete and \nconfluent FLAIR-hyperintensity in bihemispheric, subcortical and \nperiventricular, as well as central pontine white matter, likely \nthe sequelae of chronic small vessel ischemic disease. There is \nonly mild bifrontal cortical atrophy, the midline structures are \nin the midline, and there is no intra- or extra-axial \nhemorrhage.  There is no pathologic parenchymal, leptomeningeal \nor dural focus of enhancement.  There is no space-occupying \nlesion, and the sella, parasellar region and remainder of the \nskull base, and orbits are unremarkable. The mastoid air cells \nand included paranasal sinuses are grossly clear. The regional \nbone marrow signal is overall preserved, with no suspicious \nosseous lesion.  Incidentally noted is severe degenerative \ndisease involving the limited included upper cervical spine with \nmarked ventral canal narrowing at the C2-3 and C3-4 levels, and \nfrank compression and angulation of the cervical spinal cord at \nthe latter, as on the recent NECT of ___ this has likely \nprogressive since the MR examination of ___.\nIMPRESSION:\n1. The diffusion-weighted sequence is very limited, particularly \nat the\ncranial vertex, likely due to technical factors (unclear, at \npresent);\nhowever, there is no definite large focus of slow diffusion to \nsuggest acute ischemia.\n2. No pathologic focus of enhancement or cerebral edema to \nsuggest\nintracranial metastatic disease.\n3. Bifrontal cortical atrophy and moderately severe sequelae of \nchronic small vessel ischemic disease.\n4. Severe degenerative disease in the limited included upper \ncervical spine, with significant compression and angulation of \nthe spinal cord at the C3-4 level.\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ year old male with metastatic NSCLC presenting s\/p \nunwitnessed fall at rehab. He was recently discharged on \n___ for an admission for nausea, vomiting and anion-gap \nmetabolic acidosis.\n\n#FALL\nMr. ___ fell off the side of his bed after reaching for the \nurinal. He recalls the entire event and denies any loss of \nconsciousness. He was advised by nursing to call for help if he \nneeded to use the urinal. He ignored this advice. The fall \nappears to be mechanical, however the patient reported right \nupper extremity weakness after the event. His weakness was \ndifficult to assess initially due to pain in his right shoulder, \ngrip strength was decreased to ___ on presentation. He sustained \na minor amount of head trauma. CT scan in the ED revealed a \nsmall subgaleal hematoma, no intracranial hemorrhage and \nnon-displaced left nasal and right lamina papyracea fractures. \nHis most significant complaint after the fall was right shoulder \npain. XR in the ED demonstrated no fracture or pathology of the \n___ joint. He received IV morphine with good effect. He used a \nsling during the early part of his hospitalization. Pain control \nwas provided with morphine ___ and morhpine IV PRN. After he \nwas unable to swallow, he was placed on morphine oral \nconcentrate 5q3h standing and ___ PRN.\n\n#RIGHT ARM WEAKNESS\nMr. ___ presented with right arm weakness which was initially \ndifficult to assess because of his right upper extremity pain \nafter the fall. On the second day of his hospitalization his \nstrength improved, however was clearly different from the left \nupper extremity. His right upper extremity strength remained at \n___ and he later developed right lower extremity strength. A \nfacial droop was noted by the pulmonary consult team, but was \nfelt to be facial asymmetry with preserved function of all \nfacial nerves and muscles by the medicine team. An MR head was \nobtain on ___ which showed no evidence of stroke and evere \ndegenerative disease in the upper cervical spine, with \nsignificant compression and angulation of the spinal cord at the \nC3-4 level. This was thought to be the culprit lesion. Full \nC-spine MR imaging was not obtained as the patient was \nsubsequent made CMO, therefore a compressive metastatic lesion \ncould not be totally excluded. The patient responded well to \ndexamethasone 10mg IV x1 followed by 4mg IV Q6hrs. His extremity \nstrength improved to ___. It remained unclear whether the fall \nand associated neck trauma precipitated further cord compression \nor if the weakness was present before the fall. Dexamethasone \nwas discontinued when the patient became unable to swallow.\n\n#FACIAL FRACTURES\nNon-displaced left nasal and right lamina papyracea fractures. \nCase discussed with ENT; non-operative, antibiotics recommended. \nPatient was started on a 7 day course of amoxicillin, which was \nlater discontinued with initiation of post-obstructive pneumonia \ntreatment.\n\n#SHORTNESS OF BREATH\nMr. ___ complained of shortness of breath since his discharge \non ___. He was admitted on 24hr nasal cannula oxygen. He \nhas a chronic cough which is unchanged. He denied sputum \nproduction, worsening chest pain, fevers and chills on \npresentation. His SOB is likely related to his primary lung \ncancer and large, malignant effusion on the left. The patient \nreceived a dose of levofloxacin in the ED, which was not \ncontinued on the floor. Chest CT noted focal RML ___ \nopacities suggestive of inflammation or early infection. He had \nno lower extremity swelling or other evidence of DVT. The \npatient developed low grade temperatures on his ___ and ___ \nhospital days; treatment for post-obstuctive HCAP was started \nwith cefepime and vancomycin. His fevers resolved, however his \nshortness of breath did not significantly change. His PlearX \ncatheter was drained as necessary. Output was quite poor \ncompared to his previous admission, <250mL per 2 days. The \npatient was made CMO and his IV was not replaced. Cefepime and \nvancomycin were changed to levofloxacin, but this was \ndiscontinued when the patient became unable to swallow. He was \non morphine oral concentrate as above for dyspnea as well.\n\n#METASTATIC NSCLC \nPatient presented with dyspnea, cough and community acquired \npneumonia in ___. Imaging studies included CT chest on \n___ which disclosed a consolidation of the lingula, \nbronchial narrowing, mediastinal lymphadenopathy, liver \nhypodense lesions and a large loculated left pleural effusion. A \nPET\/CT Scan from ___ disclosed the presence of an extensive \nFDG-avid consolidative process in the lingula, lymphangitic \ncarcinomatosis, non-FDG avid pleural effusion, FDG-avid \nlymphadenopathy involving the bilateral supraclavicular regions, \nmediastinum, subcarinal stations, hilar portacaval and \nretroperiotenal nodes. FDG-avid liver lesions and FDG-avid \nosseous metastases. Pleural fluid removed on ___ disclosed \na carcinoma. Immunohistochemical stains of the tumor cells were \npositive for CK5\/6, and CK7; and negative for CK20, p63, and \nTTF-1. This immunoprofile was nonspecific but compatible with a \nnon-small-cell lung cancer not otherwise specified. Extensive \ndiscussions between family, patient and primary oncologist lead \nto the decision for no further cancer directed therapies, \nincluding palliative chemo, radiation or surgery. \n\n#AG METABOLIC ACIDOSIS\nIssue on previous admission, attributed to lactic acidosis from \nmalignancy, and metformin. Metformin discontinued on previous \nadmission. Lactate on ___ 6.6. Anion gap stable, no \nimprovement with IVFs.  \n  \n#TYPE II DIABETES MELLITUS\nMetformin and glyburide discontinued during previous \nhospitalization due to reports of hypoglycemia and lactic \nacidosis. Insulin sliding scale continued during hospitalization \nin the setting of dexamethasone administration. Aspirin \ndiscontinued after CMO decision was made. \n  \n#HYPERTENSION\nBlood pressures well controlled this admission. Diltiazem 15 mg \nPO\/NG QID continued until CMO decision was made.\n\n#PROLAPSED HEMORRHOIDS\nStable issue. Outpatient follow up suggested during prior \nadmission. Patient ordered for an aggressive bowel regimen.\n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES\n*******************\n-PleurX catheter care, drainage PRN\n-Continue concentrated morphine solution for dyspnea and pain, \nmay increase to 5mg q5min as needed\n-Continue inhaler for shortness of breath\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

Given \npatient's history and exam, including wet rales, elevated \njugular venous pressure, and lower extremity edema, likely acute \nheart failure exacerbation in the setting of worsening renal \nfailure. Pneumonia unlikely given no history of cough, sputum \nproduction, or fever, and no suggestive findings on CT.  The \npatient's EKG showed no changes suggestive of ischemia and \ncardiac enzymes were negative.  The patient was treated with \nfurosemide and responded with diuresis with improvement in his \ndyspnea.  His supplemental oxygen was discontinued and his \nrespiratory rate and oxygen saturation remained normal \nthroughout his course.\n.  \n#. Right flank\/inguinal pain: Possible etiologies include \nnephrolithiasis, urinary tract infection\/pyelonephritis, \nmusculoskeletal spasm, hip arthritis\/bursitis, or hernia.  Early \nzoster outbreak was also considered as pain seems to be in a \ndermatomal distribution. CT scan was negative for stones, does \nshow stranding on the right, but this appears stable from prior \nscans status post ruptured renal cyst.  Urinalysis was negative \nfor infection and patient had no other symptoms. Patient had no \nsigns of hernia on exam. Because pain seems to be relieved with \nposition (bed to couch), muscle spasm or hip bursitis most \nlikely etiology at this point.  The etiology of the patient's \npain was never discovered, but his pain remained well-controlled \non hydromorphone as needed, and he was discharged with three \ndays' supply.   \n.  \n#. Acute on chronic renal failure: Patient with worsening \nchronic kidney disease over the last several months, creatinine \non admission 5.3 from 4.1 one month prior to admission. CT scan \nshowed bilateral renal atrophy and chronic changes from cyst \nrupture in ___. Acutely worsening renal function likely as a \nresult of decompensated heart failure.   The patient was \nfollowed by Renal while in-house; venomapping was performed so \nthat an AV fistula could be placed in the near future if \ndialysis becomes necessary. Potassium restriction was added to \nthe patient's diet and he was placed on a phosphate binder. He \nwas also placed on 1.5 liter fluid restriction. The patient's \ncreatinine improved with diuresis and was at 3.9 on the day of \ndischarge.  He will follow up with Nephrology upon discharge.\n.  \n#. Lung nodules: Based on CT scan read, new nodules most likely \nmalignant, and patient has 40 pack year smoking history. Nodules \nunlikely to be contributing to acute decompensation.  This is \nlikely contributing to reported appetite loss as well.  \nCT-guided pleural biopsy was scheduled for outpatient workup. \n.  \n#. Leukocytosis: Patient with WBC of approximately 20 throughout \nthe course of his hospitalization.  He was afebrile and is not \non any immunosuppressions.  There were no symptoms of infection, \nno signs of infection on exam.  Urine culture was negative, with \nblood cultures pending.  Chest x-ray did not show pneumonia, CT \nscan abdomen\/pelvis was negative, and patient had no spinous \nprocess tenderness concerning for osteomyelitis or abscess.  \nThere were no murmurs or other sequelae of endocarditis.  There \nwas no headache or neck stiffness so there was low concern for \nmeningitis.  Lung nodules may be atypical infection, however \nbased on shape, size, more likely malignant. Vital signs were \nmonitored and the patient remained afebrile thoughout his \nhospitalization. He had a single episode of vomiting but no \nother symptoms.  Blood cultures are still pending at the time of \ndischarge.\n.\n#. Hyperkalemia: The patient developed hyperkalemia to 5.9 in \nthe setting of acute-on-chronic renal failure.  He had no \nsymptoms and EKG showed no changes from prior.  He was started \non Kayexalate, continued on furosemide, put on a \npotassium-restricted diet, and his losartan was discontinued.  \nOn the day of discharge, his potassium had normalized to 4.1\n.  \n#. Acute hematocrit drop: On Day 2 the patient's hematocrit \ndropped approximately 3 points.  This was thought to be unlikely \nto be dilutional as he was not getting fluids.  There were no \nsymptoms of bleeding.  Chronic anemia was likely secondary to \nhis chronic kidney disease but is unlikely to account for his \nacute drop.  There was no retroperitoneal bleed seen on \nadmission CT.  Hematocrit was trended and remained stable \nthroughout the course of his admission, and the etiology for his \nacute drop was never discovered. \nINACTIVE ISSUES:\n#. Diabetes: Continued patient's insulin regimen.  \n.  \n#. Hyperlipidemia: Continued statin.    \n.  \n#. Atrial fibrillation: Continued metoprolol, amiodarone. \nPatient off coumadin since renal hemorrhage. Patient reports he \ndoes not take aspirin per his PCP's recommendations following \nhis renal hemorrhage.  \n.  \n#. Hypertension: Continue metoprolol\/losartan\/isosorbide.  Per \nattending's recommendations, isosorbide mononitrate dosing \nshould be changed on an outpatient basis to daily instead of \ntwice daily so the patient does not build up tolerance to the \ndrug.  \n.  \n#. Hypothyroid: Continued levothyroxine.  \n.  \n#. Gout: Allopurinol was held given renal failure.\nTRANSITION OF CARE:\nFollow-up:  patient will follow up with his primary care \nprovider and with ___ upon dishcharge.

Your shortness of breath was most likely due to worsening of your heart failure and worsening of your kidney disease. We treated your shortness of breath with furosemide (Lasix), which helped remove some of the extra fluid from your body. While you were here, you also mentioned you had some abdominal pain. The cause of this is still not clear, but a CT scan of your abdomen did not suggest any problems with any of your abdominal organs. The CT scan of your abdomen did reveal some changes in your lungs, specifically some new nodules and a thickening of the pleura, the covering of your lungs. As we discussed with you, there are several causes that could be responsible for these changes, one of which is cancer."}

Resp \nwere not labored. crackles noted at bases bilaterally, no \nwheezes or rhonchi. No dullness to percussion.\nExt: 1+ pitting edema No c\/c. No femoral bruits. \n \nPertinent Results:\nChest X-Ray ___: There is a large right pleural effusion with \nadjacent atelectasis. There is stable mild pulmonary edema. \nThere is concern for locuated left pleural effusion. Cardiac \nsilhouette is difficult to evaluate due to summation of shadows. \nEvaluation of lung apex is suboptimal. Cluster of calcified \nlymph nodes again appreciated at the right hilus, and axilla, \nand has midline sternotomy wires. There is likely hearing device \non the right. \n  \nIMPRESSION: \n1. Moderate right pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis, \nand chronic \nelevation of right hemidiaphragm. \n2. Concern for questionable left loculated pleural effusion. \nRepeat \nradiograph, non-rotated to evaluate further is recommended. \n3. Mild pulmonary edema. \n\nTTE ___: The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular \nwall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is \nconsiderable beat-to-beat variability of the left ventricular \nejection fraction due to an irregular rhythm\/premature beats. \nRight ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. \nThe diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels \nare normal. A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is present. \nThe aortic valve prosthesis appears well seated, with normal \nleaflet\/disc motion and transvalvular gradients. The mitral \nvalve leaflets are severely thickened\/deformed. There is severe \nmitral annular calcification. There is moderate valvular mitral \nstenosis (area 1.0-1.5cm2). Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation \nis seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral \nregurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The \ntricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] \ntricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is severe pulmonary \nartery systolic hypertension. The end-diastolic pulmonic \nregurgitation velocity is increased suggesting pulmonary artery \ndiastolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.\n\nCompared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, \nthe severity of mitral stenosis is similar. The severity of \nmitral and tricuspid regurgitation has increased. Pulmonary \nartery systolic hypertension has worsened \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nPatient is an ___ year old female with a pmh significant for CAD, \nsevere MS, afib, bioprosthetic AVR (___) and CVA who presented \nwith with SOB likely due to diastolic congestive heart failure.\n  \n#. Pump: Acute on Chronic Diastolic Congestive Heart Failure: \nTTE on ___ showed EF 55%-60%. During her prior admission even \nafter rate control for her afib RVR, patient was not able to \nautodiurese, and continued to be fluid overloaded. Lasix was \ntitrated to acheive a stable, oral dose that would be able to be \nmaintainned at home. On admission she had an increased JVP, \nfluid in her lungs noted on X-Ray and lower extremity edema \nsuggestive of decompensated heart failure although BNP was not \nelevated. Last ECHO showed moderate valvular mitral stenosis \n(area 1.0-1.5cm2) therefore will not aggressively diurese. Her \nblood pressures had been tenuous especially after lasix \nadministration. TTE on ___ revealed the severity of mitral and \ntricuspid regurgitation had increased and that pulmonary artery \nsystolic hypertension has worsened. She had a thorocentesis on \n___ which removed about 700cc of serosanguinous fluid. Based on \nlight's criteria the fluid was consistent with a transudative \neffusion. She reported feeling much better immediately after the \nprocedure and she required less oxygen. Her home regimen of \nlasix was changed to 80mg in the morning and 60 in the \nafternoon. She should have close follow up with focus on her \nblood pressure and electorlytes. \n\n#. Rhythm: Persistent Atrial Fibrillation: She was cconsistently \nin afib however she was rate controlled on 120mg diltiazem bid. \nHer coumadin was held and she was started on a heparin bridge \nfor her thorocentesis. Prior to discharge she started back on \nher coumadin and sent home with lovenox until her INR is checked \nas an outpatient. It should be noted that she is listed as \nhaving a heparin allergy however she tolerated heparin during \nher admission.\n\n#.CAD: She has a history of CAD s\/p PCI with successful LAD\/D1 \nbifurcation PTCA in ___.

She reportedly had not \nbeen taking her amiodarone due to confusion about whether she \nshould be taking the medication, which was thought to be the \nlikely instigating factor. There was no evidence of hemodynamic \ninstability and volume status was euvolemic after dialysis. \nIschemia was considered unlikely with flat troponins. The \npatient remained in a-fib\/flutter on telemetry on the floor \n(maximum rates in the 130s), and was relatively asymptomatic \nwith occasional sensation of palpitations, no chest pain, SOB or \nlightheadedness. She was given fractionated metoprolol for rate \ncontrol and started on a heparin drip for anticoagulation for a \nsub-therapeutic INR of 1.5 at presentation. She was noted to \nspontaneously convert to sinus rhythm on ___ at 0700, \nwhere she remained until discharge.\n- Resumed amiodarone 200mg daily\n- Discontinued metoprolol tartrate on ___ due to bradycardia; \nthe patient noted that she had been on Toprol in the outpatient \nsetting which was discontinued for low heart rates.\n- INR was 1.8 at discharge, heparin gtt was continued until d\/c. \nPatient was instructed to follow-up with her PCP who monitors \nher INR\n- Will need close follow-up for INR check\n- Notably, INR was therapeutic until ___ last check at ___, \nnot therapeutic on admission\n- ___ consider ablation in future\n- TSH was checked and was normal at 1.2 on admission\n\n# Chest pain, resolved\nThe patient noted a history of chest pain that had been \nintermittent for a somewhat extended period of time, most likely\nrelated to her rates related to a-fib\/ flutter with RVR. In \n___ she had a that showed stress w\/ infarct, no \nreversible findings. She had normal HRs at recent office visit \nand was reporting similar CP, unclear if paroxysmal fib resulted \nin CP vs underlying vascular disease. The patient has \nsignificant risk factors for CAD, so this must remain on the \ndifferential, although there was no concern for ischemia this \nadmisison. Could also be microvascular vs atypical. Of note, CP \nresolved with rate control and troponins remained stable.\n- Resumed amiodarone prior to discharge, d\/c'd metoprolol\n- Home BP meds were continued as per below\n- Consider repeat nuclear stress test at future time if patient \nhas repeat symptoms\n\n================\nCHRONIC ISSUES:\n================\n# ESRD on HD\nThe patient was seen by the Nephrology HD consult service during \nhospitalization and received HD on ___ per her usual \nHD schedule.\n- Medications were dosed by HD guidelines and nephrotoxins were \navoided\n- Home Velphoro non-formulary, was given sevelamer inpatient\n\n# HTN\n- Home felodipine was held and patient was given amlodipine \nwhile inpatient\n- Continued home hydralazine\n- Continued home clonidine\n\n# HLD\n- Continued home atorvastatin\n\n# T2DM\n- Home glipizide was held during hospitalization and resumed at \ndischarge\n- ISS given while in-house\n\n# COPD\n- Continued home albuterol inhaler\n\n# PTSD\n- Continued home clonazepam\n\n# Gout\n- Continued home allopurinol\n\n#CODE: Full Code\n#CONTACT: HCP: ___, Daughter, Home: ___, \nCell: ___\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

His aspirin is most likely going to be \nindefinitely held given his amyloid angiopathy.\n\nUpon admission, Mr. ___ home aspirin and heparin were \nheld, while he was continued on home simvastatin, Metoprol, \nKeppra, and Lamictal. MRI head with and without contrast \nre-demonstrated a heterogeneous intraparenchymal hematoma in the \nright temporal and right parietal lobes measuring approximately \n40 x 46 mm in transverse dimension, causing mild mass effect and \neffacement of the sulci and right occipital ventricular horn. \nFor several days he had a fever of unknown etiology. However, \nblood cultures, chest X ray, and urine analysis showed no signs \nof infection. In additional, he had no leukocytosis and no \nadditional signs of sepsis. Fever was believed to be central \nrather than infection, and fever was monitored daily and by \ndischarge had resolved (afebrile for > 24 hours). During his \nstay Mr. ___ also developed hyponatremia with labs that \nsuggestd it was secondary to SIADH, and he was fluid restricted \nto 1 liter. His sodium gradually improved.  On the day of \ndischarge, his Na was 134 but he will likely need some level of \nfluid restrictions for the time being.\n\nMr. ___ was evaluated by ___ and OT during his stay.

We think that your brain bleed is due to a condition called amyloid angiopathy which causes abnormal protein deposition in your bleed vessels, making them more prone to bleeding. Neurologically, you continue to remain stable. You were found to have low blood concentration in your blood which is likely secondary to the brain bleed. The treatment for the low sodium is to limit the total daily fluid intake to less than one liter. Your sodium level is expected to improve as you improve neurologically.

Overall unchanged appearance of the aortic \nstent graft and the size of the aorta. New 13 x 7 mm \ncalcification between the stent graft and the right mainstem \nbronchus is of unclear etiology. Calcified hematoma is a \npossibility. New small left pleural effusion and adjacent \natelectasis.\n\nPortable TTE (Complete) Done ___ at 9:20:00 AM\nThe left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric \nleft ventricular hypertrophy. Regional left ventricular wall \nmotion is normal. Left ventricular systolic function is \nhyperdynamic (EF>75%). There is a mild resting left ventricular \noutflow tract obstruction. There was no change in the left \nventricular outflow tract gradient with Valsalva maneuver. There \nis no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size \nand free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly \ndilated. The aortic arch is mildly dilated. The aortic valve \nleaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not \npresent. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral \nvalve leaflets are structurally normal. There is no mitral valve \nprolapse. Mild to moderate early systolic (___) mitral \nregurgitation is seen. Moderate late systolic [2+] tricuspid \nregurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery \nsystolic hypertension. There is a trivial\/physiologic \npericardial effusion.\nCompared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___ \nleft ventricular systolic function is now hyperdynamic and with \nthis there is a mild resting LVOT gradient that does not \nincrease with valsalva. Ascending aorta is slightly more \ndilated. Overall findings are suggestive of hypertensive heart \ndisease. Other findings are similar.\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ year old woman w history of COPD, tracheobronchial malacia, \nthoracic aorta aneuryism s\/p graft, and chronic hypercarbemia \nwith multiple recent admissions for high CO2, now presents with \nacutely low O2 saturation with some symptomatic confusion, \nresolved by the time of arrival to the MICU.\n\nACTIVE ISSUES\n\n# Hypoxemic respiratory failure:\nUpon arrival to floor with BIPAP at FiO2 30%, she was satting \n100% and comfortable, alert, awake, without complaints.  She was \nsubsequently weaned to 2 to 3LPM NC during the day and BiPAP \n___ at night. However at one point during the daytime, while on \n4L NC, she became more somnolent with paCO2 of 116. She again \nimproved with BiPAP. Overall her chronic hypercarbia (secondary \nto severe COPD with likely component related to airways \ncompression from aneurysm) was challenging to carefully manage. \nHer FiO2 was kept as low as possible and ETCO2 was measured \nintermittently, as has been done at her rehab facility. She was \nplaced on BiPAP during the day when becoming more somnolent or \nwith napping, and this kept her free of very marked rises in \nCO2. It does not seem likely that she can go for a whole day \nwithout BiPAP, and this pattern was confirmed with rehab \npre-admission. It is hopeful that her chronic respiratory \nfailure will improve with stenting by IP in the near future, \nthough this remains uncertain. For PAP she was also trialed on \nAVAPS at night, with mean inspiratory pressures around 18, which \ncould be considered at rehab as well.\n\nRegarding the stent placement, Interventional Pulmonology was \nconsulted and recommended clearance from vascular surgery (see \nbelow), pulmonary hypertension service, anesthesia (as an \noutpatient), cardiology (to rule out HOCM) and interval \nfollow-up with IP before the procedure. An ECHO was performed \nwhich showed LV outflow obstruction not increased by Valsalva, \nwhich was not consistent with a diagnosis of HOCM. Cardiology \nrecommended maintaining euvolemia and avoiding any diuretics. \nThe pulmonary hypertension service was consulted and cleared her \nfor rigid bronchoscopy, no need for specific PAH therapy at this \ntime, to avoid CCBs (as this may exacerbate her VQ mismatch) and \nregular ABGs from an arterial line during the stenting \nprocedure. She is set to have the custom Y-stent placed in a few \nweeks by IP pending clearance and follow-up.\n\n# Abrnormal EKG\nShe was noted to have peaked T waves on telemetry on routine \nmonitoring. She was asymptomatic (no chest pain, palpitations, \nacute respiratory compromise). EKG was performed which showed \npeaked T waves, most pronounced in V2-3, with corresponding high \nvoltage in these leads. There was no evidence of ischemia and \nthese changes were unchanged from several prior studies.\n\n# Thoracic aortic aneurysm s\/p rupture with graft\nVascular surgery was consulted regarding clearance for surgery \n(upcoming stent placement) and possible revision of the graft to \nimprove her respiratory status. She deemed stable for surgery \nfrom this standpoint with no vascular surgery intervention \nrequired at this time.\n\n# Hypertension\nNorvasc held on admission given reported history of allergy \ndespite listed on her home medication list. Continue to hold \ngiven the potential for amlodipine causing a worsening of her \nrespiratory status due to V\/Q mismatch exacerbation with \namlodipine causing pulmonary vasodilation. Systolic blood \npressures occasionally spiked to 170s during admission on \nmetoprolol and hydralazine so her hydralazine was increased from \nBID to TID with good control.\n\nCHRONIC ISSUES\n# Hypothyroidism: Continued on home levothyroxine. \n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\n- Would ensure euvolemic volume status leading up to stent \nplacement; discharge weight is 54.2 kg\n- Given patient's severity of COPD and pulmonary hypertension, \nplease avoid calcium channel blockers as it may worsen V\/Q \nmismatch in her lungs. Her amlodipine was stopped for this \nreason.\n- Patient should adhere as much as possible to her nebulizer and \ninhaler treatment to optimize her COPD.\n- She was discharged on BiPAP with settings of ___ cmH2O. While \nshe was here, she was trialed with AVAPS on a Triology device. \nHer average inspiratory pressure was 18 cmH2O. Please consider \nincreasing her BiPAP settings if she has inadequate ventilation.\n- She was hypertensive this admission, and her hydralazine dose \nwas increased to 50mg TID.\n- She will have follow up with Interventional Pulmonology, Dr. \n___, 1 week prior to the stent placement. Dr. ___ \n___ will contact her for follow up.\n- She was need a repeat CTA and follow up with Vascular Surgery \nin 3 months regarding her thoracic aneurysm.\n- She will need anesthesia clearance prior to procedure.\n- Her diet was changed to pureed solids\/thin liquids for comfort \ngiven report of dysphagia, likely secondary to compression of \nher esophagus by the thoracic aneurysm. She will need ongoing \nevaluation after treatment of her tracheal compression.\n \nMedications on Admission:\n1. Albuterol Inhaler ___ PUFF IH Q4H:PRN cough \n3.

This is likely secondary to her \nmalignancy. Since the patient stopped coumadin approximately 3 \nweeks prior to admission after completing a 6 month course of \nanti-coagulation for a previous PE, she is likely to need \nlifelong anti-coagulation. It is recommended that the patient \nstay on lifelong Lovenox, as studies have shown this medication \nis a more efficacious anti-coagulant in cancer patients than \ncoumadin. Since the patient's insurance company will not pay for \nthis treatment, we are forced to start coumadin in this patient. \nDuring her hospital course, she was maintained on a heparin drip \nand transitioned to coumadin successfully.

Since the surgery the \npain has worsened and this is her second admission post-op for \npain control. Last admission an MRI showed no evidence of cord \ncompression. CT A\/P this admission demonstrated persistent \nseroma\/mass that could be compressing several nerves. OB\/Gyn \nevaluated her and determined that there was no role for surgical \nremoval. Anesthesia determined she would not benefit from a \nnerve block. Radiation oncology evaluated her and thought that \nsystemic chemotherapy would be more beneficial, and would \nreassess for any role of radiation therapy after chemo. Patient \nhad PICC line placed and was started on C1D1 carboplatin ___ \nwith dexamethasone and tolerated well. She was continued on \ndexamethasone due to ongoing issues with pain control and \nfluctuating weakness in the lower extremity. Palliative care \nteam recommended pain control with methadone, morphine PRN, and \ngabapentin. Her antidepressant was switched to duloxetine for \nadditional neuropathic pain control benefit. With this regimen \nher pain and weakness were stabilized. She will follow up with \nDr. ___ in clinic and is scheduled for her next chemo treatment \nat the end of ___.\n\n# Leukocytosis\n# UTI\nMinimal urinary symptoms but UA consistent with infection. Given \nshe was initiating chemotherapy she was treated with ceftriaxone \nx7d (___).\n\n# Stage III C2 endometrial cancer\ns\/p recent debulking surgery and now s\/p ___ \ncarboplatin, next due in 3 weeks. Had TTE here for treatment \nplanning. She had a PICC line placed for in-house chemo. This \nwas removed at discharge. She will have a chemo port placed \nlater this month prior to her next dose of carboplatin. She has \nfollow up scheduled with Dr. ___.

There is mild posterior leaflet mitral valve \nprolapse. A late systolic jet of Moderate (2+) mitral \nregurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic \npressure is normal. There is a trivial\/physiologic pericardial \neffusion.\n\nIMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with \npreserved regional and global biventricular systolic function. \nMild posterior mitral valve prolapse with moderate mitral \nregurgitation. \n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ past medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, \nhypothyroidism, T2DM, with recent admission for palpitations who \np\/w weakness and found to be in tachyarrhythmia and concern for \nCHF on admission CXR.\n  \n# Paroxysmal weakness and AVNRT: Collateral information from \npt's daughter and husband suggests that her weakness is more \nparoxysmal and sudden in onset, not ongoing stable weakness as \nshe had described at admission. Given that she was in AVNRT at \nadmission during one of these episodes of weakness, this is the \nmost likely cause for her symptoms.  She had recently \nself-discontinued her metoprolol which was started for AVNRT \nduring a previous admission, it is not clear why she stopped \ntaking this medication.  We restarted her on metoprolol tartate \n25mg bid which will be changed to 50mg of metoprolol succinate \nat discharge.  She continued to have a few episodes of what \nappeared to be AVNRT on telemetry this admission which all \nself-resolved without intervention.  Her HCTZ-losartan was held \nthis admission and she remained normotensive.  TSH was mildly \nsuppressed and T4 was at the high end of normal, so her \nlevothyroxine was decreased from 112mcg to 100mcg.\n     Her admission CXR showed concern for pulmonary edema, \nalthough clinically there was no evidence of heart failure (no \ncrackles in lungs, no peirpheral edema, no JVD, satting high \n___ on room air).  She had a TTE which showed a preserved \nEF and 2+ MR.  ___ ruled out for MI, trop was slightly elevated \nafter her tachycardia in the ED but CK-MB was normal.  She will \nfollow-up with Dr. ___ discharge.\n \n# Subcarinal lymphadenopathy and granulomatous changes: \nPathology from recent biopsy of stage IV lymph node was \nconsistent w\/ granulomatous lymphadenitis. Sarcoidosis is in \ndifferential and most likely ___. This may be the etiology \nfor some of her underlying fatigue and nightsweats. This is also \nthe likely explaination for the interstitial changes seen on her \nadmission CXR given that there was no clinical evidence of \npulmonary edema.  Was supposed to see Dr. ___ week for \nPFTs.  Her appointment with pulmonology and outpatient PFTs were \nrescheduled.\n\n--Inactive issues--\n  \n# Anemia: Hct remained within baseline this admission, slight \ndecrease likley dilutional after she received fluids in the ED.  \nThere was no clinical evidence of bleeding. \n  \n# Hypothyroidism: As above, TSH slightly low but free T4 \nhigh-normal.  Levothyroxine decreased to 100mcg 6 days\/week.\n  \n# HTN: Was somewhat hypotensive in the ED while she was in \nAVNRT.  HCTZ-losartan was held this admission and will be held \nat discharge, BP remained well controlled.\n  \n# Hypercholesterolemia: Simvastatin 20 mg daily\n  \n# T2DM: Held glyburide 5 mg and covered with HISS.  Will restart \nglyburide at discharge.\n\n# Code status this admission: Full (discussed with patient)  \n\n# ___ issues:\n-Restarted on metoprolol succinate 50mg daily for control of her \nAVNRT\n-Holding HCTZ-losartan and BP remained well controlled, BP \ncontrol should be reassessed as an outpatient\n-Levothyroxine dose decreased to 100mcg 6 days per week, repeat \nTSH and free T4 in ___ weeks\n \nMedications on Admission:\nPreadmission medications listed are correct and complete.  \nInformation was obtained from PatientwebOMR.\n1.

Lung \nvolumes are low \nlimiting assessment.  There is mild left basal atelectasis which \nappears \nunchanged.  There is likely mild hilar congestion with mild \nstable \ncardiomegaly.  The aorta is calcified and somewhat unfolded.  No \nconvincing \nevidence for pneumonia, large effusion or pneumothorax.  \nVisualized osseous structures appear intact. \n  \n___ CT HEAD W\/O CONTRAST\n1. Right cerebral subdural hematoma containing acute and \nsubacute hemorrhagic \ncomponents, measures up to 8 mm an causes 4 mm of leftward shift \nof midline \nstructures.  Minimal change from prior. \n2. Expected evolution of the subacute infarct in the right \nfrontal cortex. \n\n___ CHEST (PORTABLE AP)\nIn the setting of chronic moderate cardiomegaly and persistent \npulmonary \nvascular congestion, new opacification at the lung bases should \nbe treated as possible edema.  Alternatively this could \nrepresent aspiration, particularly in the right lower lobe. \n  \nSmall left pleural effusion is new.  No pneumothorax. \n\n___ CT HEAD W\/O CONTRAST\n1. Evolution of the subdural fluid collection on the right, \nwithout evidence \nof new hemorrhage. \n2. Minimal right-to-left midline shift with effacement of the \nsulci and right \nlateral ventricle, unchanged from prior. \n3. Evolving infarct involving the right frontal lobe, better \nvisualized on the \nprior MRI. \n\n___  CTA HEAD W&W\/O C & RECONS\n1. The mixed density right subdural hematoma is stable in size.  \nThe small \nfocus of hyperdense blood within the anterior aspect of the \ncollection appears \nslightly denser than on the prior CT, but this is most likely \nartifactual \ngiven the lack of enlargement.  This may be reassessed on \nfollow-up \nnoncontrast CT. \n2. Stable appearance of evolving subacute infarction in the \nright frontal \nlobe. \n3. High-grade stenosis at origin of the left vertebral artery \n4. Mild short-segment stenosis of the proximal V4 segment of the \nleft \nvertebral artery. \n5. At least mild narrowing of the proximal left subclavian \nartery. \n6. No evidence for carotid stenosis. \n\n___ ECG\nSinus rhythm or ectopic atrial rhythm with one eposide of block \nwith a \nconsistent P-R complex before and after the block. Left axis \ndeviation. Left anterior fascicular block can also be considered \nbut the Q wave that is noticeable in leads I and aVL on this \ntracing is quite diminutive. Clinical correlation is suggested.  \n\n___ CHEST (PA & LAT)\nIn comparison to study of ___, there is an placement of a \nsingle lead pacer that extends to the apex of the right \nventricle.  Lower lung volumes with continued enlargement of the \ncardiac silhouette and persistent pulmonary vascular congestion. \n Opacification at the left base is consistent with volume loss \nin the lower lobe and pleural fluid. \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nMs. ___ is a ___ RH F w PMHx of prior left occipital \nsubdural hematoma in ___ and mild dementia who is readmitted to \n___ currently in Neurology Stroke Service after presenting \nwith a breakthrough seizure at her rehab facility. Ms. ___ \nwas recently admitted to the medicine service with neurology \nconsults following from ___ to ___, for new onset \ncomplex partial seizures which was thought to be secondary to an \nacute right subdural hematoma s\/p fall.  \n\nHer seizure was most likely secondary to a missed dose of \nlacosamide at the ___ center. We did not consider \nthis a failure of AEDs. While in the hospital, she was found to \nhave second degree heart block. We discontinued her lacosamide \nand phenytoin for concerns that these medications could be \ncontributing to her heart block. She was seen by cardiology, who \nintroduced the possibility of placing a pacemaker. That evening, \nthe patient experienced an episode of asystole and was \ntransferred to the cardiac ICU. SHe underwent placement of a \npacemaker with EP cardiology. She tolerated the procedure well. \n\nShe was restarted on lacosamide, as the concerns for heart block \nare resolved with the pacemaker in place. She will start on \nlacosamide 100mg BID, to be advanced to 150mg BID in 7 days. \n\nShe was also noted to have evidence of cerebral edema on CT \nhead, for which she was started on dexamethasone. She will be \ndischarged to rehab with a taper schedule: \nPlease take 2mg (2 tabs) every 6 hours for 2 days, \nthen 1mg (1 tab) every 6 hours for 2 days, \nthen 1 mg twice a day for 2 days,\nthen 1mg daily for 1 day (your final dose). \n\nShe will be discharged to rehab for further care and \nrecuperation. \n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\n* dexamethasone taper for cerebral edema\n* on lacosamide for seizures - will take 100mg BID x 7 days, \nthen 150mg BID ongoing\n* s\/p pacemaker placement by cardiology - will follow up with \ncardiology\n* follow up for CT head noncontrast and outpatient follow up \nwith neurology\n\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

Patient has a history of heavy vaginal \nbleeding that has continued to worsen. This was felt to be the \nsource of her blood loss. No evidence of GI losses or hemolysis. \nPer gyn, patient has presumed adenomyosis that has been treated \nwith IUD placement x2. First IUD at previous admission was found \nto be expulsed. This admission, ultrasound and KUB did not \nidentify the second IUD placed by gyn. Given patient failed 2 \nattempts at IUD placement due to spontaneous expulsion, patient \nwas started on oral medroxyprogesterone for systemic therapy. \nEndometrial biopsy was performed that did not show evidence of \nmalignancy. Patient was referred for uterine artery embolization \nper ___. Unfortunately, urterine arteries were too small, and \nembolization procedure was unsuccessful. She was initiated on \nprogesterone and had resolution of her bleeding. See management \nof anticoagulation and antiplatelet as below.

She was discharged on \ntriple therapy (ASA, Plavix, and Coumadin) for 1 mo, with plan \nthen transition to Plavix\/Coumadin (no ASA) for at least 3mo. \nPatient did not develop new chest pain or L axillary pain \n(anginal equivalent). EKG upon arrival did not show evidence of \nnew ischemia. She did show a mild troponin elevation, which \ndowntrended, likely due to CKD with possible demand ischemia due \nto severe anemia. Given her anemia, warfarin was held, and \npatient continued on ASA, Plavix. Once bleeding stabilized her \nCoumadin was restarted. Once she reached therapeutic INR on \nwarfarin her aspirin was discontinued to reduce her risk of \nbleed. She will continue on Plavix and Coumadin as outpatient. \nShe required higher doses of Coumadin than previous home doses \nto get INR back in range. Will be d\/c'd on Coumadin 15mg daily. \nPlease keep a close eye on her INR, especially in the week after \narriving home, and dose adjust as necessary w\/ goal INR ___. \nPatient is high bleeding risk as highlighted in problem above.\n\n#ESRD on PD: Reported weight gain following missed PD. Renal was \nconsulted for adjustment of PD ordered as needed to remove \nfluid. Continued calcitriol, calcium acetate, sevelamer. Of \nnote, patient on two forms of calcium as outpatient, continue \nmonitoring Ca levels, and if elevated, d\/c calcium carbonate. \n\n#Chronic Diastolic Heart Failure: Dry weight of 126-128 kg, now \nweight up given missed PD (reported 12lb weight gain on \nadmission). Patient noted to be very sensitive to fluid shifts.  \nPatient denied SOB. Volume status was managed with PD per renal \nand she was started on torsemide 100 mg daily. Continued on home \nmetoprolol. \n\n#Fall: Patient fell while trying to sit on the toilet in the \nbathroom when in radiology dept for pelvic ultrasound. She \nreported headstrike but no LOC. Likely mechanical fall due to \nvision loss. Following the fall, patient had multiple \nmusculoskeletal complaints including L ankle\/knee pain, right \nchest wall pain, HA. She had multiple studies including X-rays \nof L foot\/ankle, L knee, L wrist and rib films that all showed \nno acute fracture. CT head was negative for acute intracranial \nbleed, but did show evidence of intra-ocular hemorrhage. Per \ndiscussion with ophthalmology and comparison to Mass Eye and Ear \nrecords, this is a known\/expected post-procedural finding. \nAdditionally, bilateral LENIs showed no DVT but did show a 2.8 \ncm mixed cystic and solid mass in the region of the left \npopliteal fossa, not seen on prior exam from ___. Pain \nwas controlled with tylenol, oxycodone, lidocaine patches.  \n\n#DMII: On U500, lantus, humalog sliding scale per previous \nhospitalization. Follows with ___.

Although he was given ampicillin \nand has a history of penicillin allergy, it is very unlikely \nthis contributed to his shortness of breath given that he had \nnot had ampicillin for over a week prior to presentation.  He \nappeared significantly volume overloaded on admission with \nvascular engorgement on CXR consistent with CHF and JVP of \n11-12cm therefore diuresis was initiated with TID IV lasix. He \nhad excellent urine output, diuresing greater than 8L per day \nfor several days. A TTE was unable to be performed due to body \nhabitus, therefore EF is unknown, but patient likely has acute \non chronic diastolic heart failure. He was discharged on 80mg \noral lasix. Of note he had previously been on lasix and \nself-discontinued because of what he believed to be excessive \nurination. Patient was re-educated on symtpoms and management of \nheart failure and agreed to reinitiate this medication. His \ndyspnea had improved at the time of discharge and he was satting \nwell on room air. Patient will hopefully have continued diuresis \nwith net fluid losses over the next several weeks as an \noutpatient.\n.  \n# CAD: Patient ruled in for NSTEMI with positive cardiac enzymes \nin the setting of heart failure. Patient denied chest pain or \ndiscomfort. Although heparin was started in ED, he was insistent \nthat it be stopped. Patient not a candidate for cardiac \ncatheterization at this time due to morbid obesity therefore he \nwas medically managed with aspirin, plavix, beta blocker and \nstatin. His risk factors need to be aggressively modified \nincluding blood sugar control, blood pressure control, as well \nas increased physical activity and weight loss, if possible.\n.  \n# HTN:  Sub-optimal control throughout entire admission although \nslight improvement with uptitration of medications. He was \ncontinued labetalol which was increased to maximum dose of 800mg \nBID. He was continued on maximal doses of norvasc and HCTZ. \nLisinopril was increased to 60mg daily  \n.  \n# UTI:  Urinalysis consistent with infection, culture \nunfortunately not performed. He was started on bactrim (day 1 = \n___ and should complete a 14 day course    \n.  \n# ? Drug reaction: Patient likely had allergic reaction to \nampicillin however exposure was greater than 1 week prior to \nadmission and rash was resolving at time of admission. Patient \nwas given solumedrol in ED given history of penicillin allergy, \nbut not continued on steroids wduring admission.  \n.  \n# ARF: Unclear if CKD or ARF given baseline creatinine unknown. \nHe has multiple risk factors for chronic kidney disease \nincluding diabetes and hypertension. This remained stable \ndespite aggressive diuresis.\n.  \n# DM:  Poorly controlled at baseline and was not optimally \ncontrolled while inpatient. He was continued on 70\/30 insulin \nand the dose was uptitrated to 75 units ___ and 110 units in AM  \n.  \n# Dyslipidemia:  His LDL was in the ___'s therefore he was \nmaintained on low dose statin  \n.  \n# ___ edema:  Patient has significant lower extremity edema to \nthe sacrum likely from total body volume overload secondary to \nheart failure as well as chronic venous stasis. He also has \nseveral areas of shallow ulceration on anterior and medical \nsurfaces of lower legs. Wound care and podiatry were consulted \nfor recommendations regarding skin care. Clinical examination \ndid not appreciably improve with diuresis, however continued \ndiuresis will likely help. \n \nMedications on Admission:\nNovolog 70\/30 70 units QHS, 100 units QAM  \nRegular insulin sliding scale BID  \nNasonex 2 sprays daily  \nLactulose 30mg BID PRN  \nHCTZ 50mg daily  \nLactaid 2 tablet QAC PRN  \nPrevacid 30mg daily 30 minute before meal  \nLipitor 10mg HS with food  \nColace 100mg BID PRN  \nNorvasc 10mg daily  \nLisinopril 40mg daily  \nMVI daily  \nASA 81mg daily  \nLabetalol 400mg BID with food  \nVitamin B12 100mcg daily  \nTylenol ___ BID and PRN  \nAlbuterol Q4-6H prn  \nImodium 4mg daily prn  \nMilk of Magnesia 30ml prn  \n?

Cr on admission 3.5 elevated from \nbaseline ___, now improving to 1.6 (on ___. Based on urine \nspin on ___, appears to be interstitial nephritis from NSAIDs. \nNo evidence of ATN. Renal ultrasound showed no evidence of \nhydronephrosis. No indication for dialysis during \nhospitalization. Lasix and spironolactone were initially held on \nadmission but restarted prior to dc.  Lisinopril  was held on \ndischarge and pt will have creatinine checked on dc. Pt was \nadvised to avoid NSAIDs. \n\n# Chest Discomfort. Most episodes of discomfort were on \n___. Patient believed it was due to GERD and felt very \ndifferent from when he has had a heart attack. After drinking \nliquids he developed dyspeptic symptoms, which would then \nresolve. Symptoms were not exertional and not associated with \ndiaphoresis.  EKG done on ___epression in \nV5, new from prior EKGs. His ___ EKG as well showed increased \nST depression in V5. There was no other evidence of possible new \nischemia on EKG. Out of an abundance of caution, obtained two \ntroponins on ___, both were 0.03, improved from 0.12 at \nadmission and with CK-MB of 2.\n\n# Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis. Patient presented with AGMA with \nAG 20, now 15. Most likely in the setting of acute renal failure \nand uremia. Slowly improving as renal function returned to \nbaseline.\n\n# Acute on Chronic Anemia. H\/H ___ on admission, below \nbaseline Hgb ___ in ___. No evidence of acute bleed. Likely \ndilutional given patient at baseline. Iron studies consistent \nwith anemia of chronic disease, which may be attributed to his \ndiabetes and renal failure.

His furosemide and spironolactone were restarted on \n___, can consider restarting patient's lisinopril as \noutpatient if renal failure improves. Would continue standing \nweights as outpatient, modification of diuretics if needed.\n\n# DM Type 2 and Hypoglycemia:\nGlucose on admission 40, s\/p juice with improvement to 58. \nPatient takes Glyburide at home. Hypoglycemia is a common side \neffect of oral antidiabetic medications and glyburide is renally \ncleared. Likely exacerbated by decreased PO intake. At discharge \nheld glyburide given that renal failure not fully resolved. \nPatient received only intermittent doses of insulin for blood \nsugars 177-210 on sliding scale. Would continue to hold \nglyburide at discharge, pending improvement in renal function \nand check glucose daily. Can restart as outpatient after \ndiscussion with PCP. Alternatively can use agents such as qHS \nlantus which may be safer and lead to less hypoglycemia.\n\n# Diarrhea: Non bloody and small volume. Occurring after \nIbuprofen use. C diff was negative. Resolved by time of \ndischarge with presence of mild constipation, improved with \nbowel regimen. \n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\n====================\n- 6-month followup renal MRI for reassessment of the left lower \npole renal complex cystic lesion. \n- Please avoid taking baths and prolonged water exposure to the \nright foot for next 2 weeks\n- Narcotics are TEMPORARY for foot pain, advise down-titration \nand patient counseled extensively on red flags of worsening \ncellulitis, knows to call PCP\/podiatrist if any worsening. \n___ PMP checked, and no aberrant prescribing.

The patient is confident that this is similar to \nprior episodes of pancreatitis. Her exam was  remarkable for \ngeneralized tenderness without signs of acute abdomen, and her \nexam remained stable throughout her stay. It slightly improved \nwith symptomatic management. Lipase was normal which was \nconsistent with her prior presentations, though unlike prior \npresentations, her other LFTs were also unremarkable save for an \nelevated alk phos. The patient did meet SIRS criteria based on \nheart rate and leukocytosis, though her white count appears to \nbe chronic and has been attributed to her splenectomy. She did \nnot have any fevers or chills. Cholangitis was ruled out with \nnormal LFTs; other etiologies of mid-epigastric pain have been \nconsidered including gastritis, ulcer disease, AAA, and \ninfection, though they were less likely at this time. Her \nhyperglycemia was likely exacerbating her symptoms as elevated \nsugars can worsen GI motility. She did have some diarrhea during \nthis stay, but she endorses alternating constipation and \ndiarrhea at home, and this was not significantly different than \nbaseline. She was able to tolerate a regular diet at the time of \ndischarge. She was continued on a low-fat, low-residual diet, \nwith her supplementary dietary enzymes (Zenpep). Her pain and \nher nausea were addressed, and she should continue on her home \npain regimen as well as her home anti-emetic regimen. \n\n#Hyperglycemia, diabetes mellitus type II, uncontrolled: Patient \nwith long history of diabetes mellitus that has been poorly \ncontrolled. Her last A1c was 11.5% in ___. The patient is \nseen at ___ by Dr. ___. She reports hyperglycemia beyond \nbaseline for the past several weeks. She was seen at ___ on \n___ at which time she was started on 25 units of U500 three \ntimes daily with sliding scale. However, with the syringe she \nhas been using, this dose is actually 125 units of U-500 TID. \nHer blood glucose in the ED was 545; she was continued on her \nhome regimen, and ___ on the floor were in the 160s. She was seen \nby ___ who suggested she simply continue on her \npre-admission regimen. She should continue on her home 125 units \nU-500 TID, in addition to her home Pioglitazone and Metformin. \nShe has close follow-up scheduled on ___ with ___, \nat which time her insulin can be further adjusted if necessary.\n\n#Hyponatremia: Sodium was 126 on presentation, but when \ncorrected for blood glucose was noted to be 133. Her chloride \nwas also low on initial presentation which was somewhat \nsuggestive of volume depletion; she recevied 3L IVF in the ED \nwhich did not continue on the floor. \n\n#Leukocytosis, chronic: The patient has had a chronic \nleukocytosis attributed to her history of splenectomy. Some \ncomponent of her leukocytosis may represent hemoconcentration as \nher HCT was borderline high. Patient remained afebrile \nthroughout her stay, and her abdominal exam continually \nimproved. She was tolerating a regular diet at the time of \ndischarge. Lipase was WNL. Bloodstream, pulmonary, or urinary \ntract infections were not acute concerns at this time. \n \n#Hypertension: Patient was continued on her home Clonidine and \nLosartan.\n\n#Chronic pain, complex regional pain syndrome: Patient has \nsignificant generalized pain at baseline. She was continued on \nher home Lidocaine patch, her home Gabapentin regimen, and home \nTizanidine.

Selective coronary angiography of this right \ndominant system revealed LAD, Ramus intermedius, SVG-OM \nocclusions. The site of the previous LMCA stent and the previous \nLCx stent was found to have no angiographically apparent flow \nlimiting stenoses. Please see interventional addendum for full \ndetails. In shoft, the ramus intermedius was found to be \noccluded and was crossed with some difficulty. Angioplasty was \nperformed with 2.0, 2.5, and 2.75 mm balloons and there was a \nresidual 20% stenosis\nwith normal flow.  2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed \nnormal systemic arterial pressure at 117\/60.\n\nFINAL DIAGNOSIS:    \n1. Occlusion of the previously stented Ramus branch (ISR vs \nthrombosis)\nof undetermined age.\n2. Successful POBA.\n3. If recurrent symptoms, stenting would be possible from the \nfemoral\napproach. Evidence of viability in this territory would be ideal \nprior\nto re-intervention.\n4. DAPT minimum 1 month, ideally ___ year.\n\nRepeat Cath ___:  Coronary angiography:  right dominant  \nLMCA:  Widely patent.  LAD:  Occluded proximally  LCX:  There \nwas a 20% stenosis in the proximal LCx at the prior stent sites. \n  There was a ___ stenosis in the ramus branch at the site of \nPOBA yesterday.  There were two layers of prior\nstents in this region and incomplete balloon expansion \nconsistent\nwith vessel rigidity.  RCA:  Co-dominant\/non dominant by prior \ncath  SVG-LPL:  Occluded on prior angiography  LIMA-LAD:  Widely \npatent.  There was a 50-60% stenosis in the LAD just after the \ntouchdown of the LIMA-LAD that is essentially unchanged from \nprior examination.   The mid to distal LAD was a\nsmall-medium sized vessel.   Interventional details  There were \nno culprits for rest pain or EKG changes which would be \nconsistent with small vessel disease.  Maximal medical therapy \nwill be pursued. \n\nAssessment & Recommendations\n1.Three vessel coronary artery disease\n2.Patent LIMA to the LAD with intermediate disease in the LAD\n3.Patent ramus at the prior POBA site performed for in-stent \nrestenosis\n4.Occluded SVG to LPL by prior examination\n\nPrevious Cath ___:  \nCoronary angiography:  right dominant\nLMCA:  Distal 40% into Ramus and OM.  \nLAD:  Occluded ostially.  Mild luminal irregularities after LIMA\ntouchdown with serial 40% lesions.\nLCX:  Ostial and proximal restenosis with 70% disease involving\nbifurcation with Ramus.\nRCA:  Known small and nondominant.  Not injected.\nLIMA-LAD:  Widely patent.\nRamus:  Ostial 70% stenosis into previously placed stent.\n--> drug eluding stent placement x2 to ramus and LCx \n(bifurcation stenting)\n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nBRIEF SUMMARY STATEMENT:  \n\n___ w\/ CAD s\/p 2v CABG (LIMA-LAD, SVG-LPL) in ___ and multiple \nstents ___ Tetra stent ramus intermedius; ___ BMS to LCx \nand \nballoon angioplasty to ramus; ___ DES x2 to ramus and LCx \n(bifurcation stenting)), bicuspid aortic valve s\/p ___ \n___ AVR ___ on coumadin, atrial fibrillation\/flutter on \namiodarone, and tachy-brady syndrome s\/p PPM placement in ___ \npresents with intermittent substernal chest pain x1d, trop leak \nof 0.32, and EKG w\/ t-wave inversions V2-V4 with 1mm ST \ndepressions V3-V4 c\/w NSTEMI.  The patient was placed on a nitro \ngtt for chest pain and BP control.  Cath on ___ showed patent \nLMCA, LAD w\/ proximal occlusion, occluded SVG->LPL (seen \npreviously), and LCX Ramus w\/ occlusion.  Pt. had LCx Ramus \nballoon angioplasty performed for in-stent re-stenosis vs. \nthrombosis.  Patient was sent back to the cath lab on ___ for \npersistent chest pain; no new culprit lesions were demonstrated, \nLIMA-LAD SVG remained patent.  The patient did well post-cath \nand was continued on Plavix (no stents placed).  Medical \noptimiziation was pursued, his Imdur was uptitrated from 60 to \n120 mg PO QD.  Because he is now on triple anticoagulant \ntherapy, his goal INR for his mechanical valve should be \n2.5-3.0.\n\nACTIVE ISSUES:\n \n# NSTEMI: Pt presented with intermittent substernal CP \nassociated with a troponin leak of 0.32 and EKG changes \nincluding t-wave inversions V2-V4 with 1mm ST depressions V3-V4 \nmeeting criteria for NSTEMI.

Pt. had TTE which revealed LVEF 50% \nsecondary to hypokinesis of the posterior and lateral walls (new \ncompared to prior TTE on ___ int he region of the rams \nwith preserved function in the LAD territory) with a higher than \nexpected transaortic gradient higher than expected for his type \nof prosthesis (chronic and stable).  Pt. underwent cath on \n___ which revealed showed patent LMCA, LAD w\/ proximal \nocclusion, occluded SVG->LPL (seen previously), and LCX Ramus w\/ \nocclusion.  Pt. had LCx Ramus balloon angioplasty performed for \nin-stent re-stenosis vs. thrombosis.  Patient was sent back to \nthe cath lab on ___ for persistent chest pain; no new culprit \nlesions were demonstrated, LIMA-LAD SVG remained patent.  Pt. \nremained chest pain free 24 hours prior to discharge.  His \nmedical regimen was continued with an increase of his imdur to \n120mg Daily.    \n\n# Leukocytosis: WBC count 14 on admission with neutrophil \npredominance thought to be ___ stress response to NSTEMI.  His \nWBC count continued to increase in the setting of receiving \nmethylprednisone for pre-allergy treatment of anticipated \ncontrast for cath.  WBC was downtrending at time of discharge.  \nThroughout the hospital course, the pt. had no signs or symptoms \nof infection.\n \nCHRONIC ISSUES:\n\n# Afib\/Aflutter:  Stable.

Home medication overdose, which led to bradycardia, relative \nhypotension, and dysarthria.  As mentioned in HPI, patient \nreceived 0.5 mg atropine and calcium carbonate and responded \nwith transient improvement of her bradycardia.  Her home \nmedication Cartia XT and lisinopril were held.  It is unclear if \nthe extra small pills that she took were lisinopril or aspirin, \nbut it was certain that she took extra Cartia XT.  She was also \nsupported with IVF.  Her HR, BP, and dysarthria gradually \nimproved during the remainder of her hospital stay.  Her serial \nneurological exam was without focal findings.  Her blood sugar \nwas monitored closely as overdose of calcium channel blocker can \nlead to inhibition of insulin release (hyperglycemia after OD is \na poor prognostic indicator).  Her blood sugar remained below \n200.  Her vital signs remained stable, and patient was \ndischarged with instruction to restart her lisinopril and Cartia \nXT on the day after discharge.  Home services were arranged to \nassist patient in medication arrangement as well as physical \ntherapy.  This should be followed up by her primary care \nphysician.  \n\n2. Acute vs. chronic kidney disease.  Crt was found to be \nelevated at 1.6 as compared to 1.2 in ___.  Unclear if this \nis chronic or acute given her length of stay since there is no \ndata point between ___ and ___.  However, she did receive IV \nfluid (NS) for presumed pre-renal state as a result of the \nhypoperfusion state secondary to Cartia XT and possible \nlisinopril OD.  This can be further evaluated by patient's \nprimary care doctor.    \n\n3. Thyroid goiter.  This is an incidental finding on chest \nX-ray.  Patient has no known history of goiter, but this likely \nhas been present for some time.  Given the likely chronic nature \nof the goiter, this can be further evaluated by patient's \nprimary physician in the outpatient setting.  \n\n4.  Hyperkalemia, likely secondary to overdose of home \nmedication and poor forward flow.  This resolved with treatment \n(D50, 10 units of regular insulin, 30 g of Kayexelate, 2L IVF) \nfrom the emergency department and holding of her home \nmedications.  EKG did not show changes typical of hyperkalemia.  \nThis can be followed up by patient's primary care physician.\n\n5.  Fall, witnessed.  During the hospital stay, patient's health \naid reported that patient was sitting on the side of the bed and \nslipped slowly to the floor.  The aid was able to catch and \nsupport patient and lower her to the floor (hips on the ground). \n Thus, patient was unharmed.  She did not hit her head or lose \nconsciousness.  She denied any pain, tenderness, \ndizziness\/lightheadedness, chest pain, palpitation.  Her \nphysical exam after the incident was unremarkable and \nessentially the same as prior.  Her neurological exam was also \nunchanged.  No further work-up was done.  She was instructed to \nget out of bed and ambulate with assist only.  Physical therapy \nalso recommended home ___.  This can be followed up by patient's \nprimary care physician.  \n \nMedications on Admission:\nCartia XT 240mg PO daily  \nlisinopril 40mg PO daily  \nAspirin 81mg PO daily  \nVitamin E  \n \nDischarge Medications:\n1.

See note.\nNote: Tumor cells have a Hurthle cell appearance consistent with\nspread from a Hurthle cell\ncarcinoma. Tumor cells are positive for PAX8, cytokeratin\ncocktail, TTF-1, thyroglobulin (weakly),\nand CD10. They are negative for Glypican, Heppar, CK20,CK7,\nSynaptophysin, and chromogranin.\nDrs. ___ have reviewed this case.\n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ female with a past medical history significant for newly \ndiagnosed metastatic thyroid cancer, panic disorder with \nagoraphobia, depression, psychosis, near-complete refusal of \npreventative care, obesity, and chronic pain. She was recently \ndischarged (___) after being admitted for pain control and \nfor bone biopsy under anesthesia, admitted again for further \npain management, found to have unstable C-spine in setting of \nmass compression.\n\n#Metastatic thyroid cancer\n#C-5 metastatic lesion\/pathologic fracture: Biopsy from her \niliac bone from her last admission demonstrated Hurthle cell \nthyroid carcinoma. MRI obtained ___ showed effacement of C5 and \nC5 pathological compression fracture as well as multiple \ncalvarian brain mets. She has L hand numbness\/weakness thought \nto be a consequence of the brain lesion vs. the cervical spinal \nlesion.  Per rad onc, the C5 area is very precarious and \nradiation without surgical stabilization first could cause \nfracture and\/or paralysis. She was started on IV dexamethasone \n4mg q6h which was switched to PO on discharge. We had many \ndetailed discussions with the patient and her husband with \nneurosurgery, rad-onc, palliative care, ___, and medicine \nteams in which patient and husband were informed about the risks \nand benefits of cervical stabilization surgery, radiation vs \ncomfort care. The patient understands that if she leaves the \nhospital without surgical stabilization of the cervical spine, \nshe is at risk of c-spine fracture, paralysis, and death. The \npatient understands these risks and would like to leave the \nhospital to enjoy this time with her family and discuss with \nthem to make a decision about her treatment moving forward. She \nunderstands that there really are two options 1. Surgical \nstabilization of the cervical spine followed by radiation \ntherapy vs. 2. A more palliative, comfort focused approach. She \nhas been consistent throughout all of these meetings in her \nabsolute refusal to proceed with any surgical intervention.  Per \nthe ___ team, further management of her widely metastatic \ncarcinoma would include thyroidectomy surgery and thyroid \nsuppression.  Either way, in order to pursue more aggressive \ntreatment, she would need to first proceed with extensive \nC-spine stabilization surgery.   Pt and husband expressed \nunderstanding of her difficult situation and precarious cervical \nspine.   However, they did not feel ready to have hospice come \ninto their home and wanted to first discuss her situation with \nher sons and extended family.  We have set up ___ services \nwith the plan for bridge to hospice when she feels they are \nready.  She will follow up with Dr. ___ (appointment \npending), palliative care (appointment pending), and pending \nfurther discussions, rad\/onc and\/or neurosurgery as well.\n\n# CHRONIC PAIN ___ METASTATIC DISEASE Patient was recently \nadmitted (discharged on ___ for pain management & inpatient \nbiopsy under anesthesia from ___ to ___. During this \nadmission her home Oxycontin was increased from 10 mg to 20mg \nBID and she was continued on PRN oxycodone. Palliative care also \nmet with patient to assist with pain control and goals of care \ndiscussions. She was admitted this admission due to uncontrolled \npain on that regimen. Palliative care was involved the entire \ntime. We initially tried a PCA pump of dilaudid, which was not \neffective because the patient was not pressing the button enough \ndue to anxiety about overdosing. We then switched her back to \nall oral pain medications, replacing some prn doses with \nstanding doses, which resulted in excellent pain control for the \npatient without her having to worry too much about asking for \nprn's. On discharge, the patient feels almost completely pain \nfree, even when up walking around with ___. It seems that the \npatient gets confused about prn doses and does much better with \nhigher doses of standing doses. The patient preferred that we \nkept the regimen exactly the same for discharge. We have also \noutlined above the exact times she should take all of her \nmedications to simplify it for her. This regimen is:\n- Oxycontin 30mg TID\n- Oxycodone 10mg q6h standing\n- Oxycodone 10mg q4h prn breakthrough pain (has not used)\n- Gabapentin 300mg PO TID\n- Acetaminophen 650mg Q6hrs standing\n\n# CHRONIC MICROCYTIC ANEMIA \n# HISTORY OF ___ DEFICIENCY \nPatient has a history of anemia (likely multifactorial in \nsetting of ___ deficiency and anemia of chronic disease in setting \nof malignancy). It has downtrended during this admission, with \nHb low of 6.3. There were no signs of active bleeding. Patient \ndeclined blood transfusion as she has always declined in the \npast. There is likely a component of iron-deficiency given \nferritin of 17 in setting of extensive disease. She was given IV \nferric gluconate 125mg x 2 days. PO ferrous sulfate 325mg BID \nwas held due to concern for GI side effects. Can consider \nrestarting as outpatient.\n\n# HYPERKALEMIA\nK elevated to 6.0 on ___. Gave calcium, insulin, and dextrose \nwith decline of K to 4.3.  Ace-inhibitor was stopped and renal \nfunction remained stable with mild CKD.  Potassium on discharge \nwas 5.0. We suspect there is a component of hemolyzing, as she \nhad many blood draws with mildly elevated potassium in the \nmorning and the whole blood potassium recheck returned within \nnormal range without any intervention.\n\n# Depression, anxiety, psychosis: \nPatient endorses panic attacks and trauma associated with\nhospitals. She gets very anxious about bad news. We continued \nher home sertraline, seroquel, and valium. Her anxiety also \nimproved significantly with pain control as well. The Paient was \nin communication with her psychiatrist Dr. ___ while in \nhospital. Per patient's request, the team initially told the \npatient's husband about any big news first, and allowed him to \nrelay it to her in a more \"gentle\" way. However, as time went \nby, the patient came more to terms with the fact that she has \ncancer and is now more accepting of news about her cancer.

We started prilosec (omeprazole) for acid reflux and you can continue taking tylenol (acetaminophen) for costochondritis. The presence of jaw pain, however, is somewhat concerning for a heart problem. We recommend a stress echo test of the heart to rule out this possible cause of your symptoms."}

She was \ndriving her car into a parking lot when she hit another car that \nwas crossing her path.  She had on her seatbelt but her airbag \ndidn't deploy.  Per the patient she did not hit her head or pass \nout but she did hit her knee on the dashboard and felt herself \ngo forward then get caught by the belt and get pulled back.  She \nimmediately noticed knee and neck pain, but thought these were \nrelatively minor so she didn't seek medical care immediately.  \nApproximately two days after the accident she began to notice \ncentral chest pain from approximately the the neck down to just \nabove her breasts.  This never radiated to her arms, back, or \nneck.  It worsened with reaching above her head. It was not \nassociated with exertion.  She denies any diaphoresis or \ndyspnea.  She denies any fevers\/chills\/or night sweats.  She \ndenied orthopnea, PND, syncope, presyncope, and exertional \ncalf\/leg pain.  She denied any history of stroke like symptoms, \nDVT or PE.  She denies ever having chest pain on exertion.  \n.\nHer knee pain has worsened since the accident with it now going \nto 6 or 7 when she bears full weight on it.  For this reason she \nhas not been bearing full weight on it.  She denies any locking, \ncatching, or clicking.  She denies any loss of stability or \ngiving out.  She has noticed some swelling that has increased.  \nShe has never injured the knee in the past.  \n.\nShortly after her accident she made an appointment with her \nprimary care provider to be seen for her knee pain.  As it was \nlate in the evening she was sent to the ED to obtain radiographs \nto rule out acute fracture.  In the ED all vital signs were \nstable.  They took knee and chest radiography, which showed no \nfracture or acute pulmonary process, but since she had \ncomplained of chest pain and had a history of diabetes she was \nadmitted to rule out myocardial infarction. On the floor she \ndenied any chest pain but continued to complain of right knee \npain.   \n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Patient denies abdominal pain, melena, \nhematochezia, nausea, constipation or diarrhea.

Initially, the \ndiagnosis was thought to be acute pyelonephritis with sepsis and \nearly DIC given a pelvic CT read on admission in conjunction \nwith fevers, chills, and pancytopenias. She was started on IV \nantibiotics and Heme\/Onc was consulted. They felt DIC was \nunlikely given blood work and the appearance of a peripheral \nsmear. Urology was consulted who suggested a concern for renal \nvein\/artery thrombosis due to the appearance of multifocal \nnecrosis in the kidney. An MRI revealed no acute thrombosis but \nwas suggestive of an acute infarction involving much of the \nupper pole and interpolar region of the left kidney without \nbeing able to rule out coexistent pyelonephritis. All cultures \nremained negative and a TTE for vegetations was negative, but \nshe completed a 14 day course of antibiotics for suspected \npyelonephritis. In the interim, her blood counts rebounded. \nVasculitis was also considered as an etiology for her SIRS but \nno clear evidence for a particular syndrome was found. Finally, \na PFO was detected raising concern for paradoxical embolization, \nparticularly given a history of Factor V Leiden, but work up was \nunremarkable. Ultimately, despite no clear reason for \nhypercoagulability, the patient was anticoagulated on Coumadin \nwith a Lovenox bridge as the benefits of anticoagulation were \nfelt to outweigh the risks. \n\n \nPast Medical History:\n- PFO\n- sinus tachycardia\n- Endometriosis\n- Chronic anemia\n- Migraine headaches\n- R radial nerve damage, causing a wrist drop, from compression\n- Melanoma in situ, excised from left leg, ___\n- TAH\/Right oophorectomy, ___ (complicated by bleeding post op \nrequiring 3u pRBC's)\n- Ex-lap for ruptured ovarian cyst, 1980s\n \nSocial History:\n___\nFamily History:\nFather has a history of mesenteric vein thrombosis s\/p small \nintestine resection; with h\/o factor V leiden with unknown \ngenetic profile.

A copy of her PCP \nvisit note accompanies her paperwork and describes that she has \nlost about 35 lbs, and possibly has been vomiting.

The \nmediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged and within normal \nlimits. The \npulmonary vascularity is normal. The lungs are clear. There is \nno focal \nconsolidation, pleural effusions or pneumothorax. Right upper \nquadrant \nabdominal surgical clips denote prior cholecystectomy. \nIMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality. \n\n___ KUB:\nThere is no evidence of ileus, obstruction, or free air. There \nis \nnormal bowel gas pattern. Clips are seen in the right upper \nabdominal \nquadrant likely from previous cholecystectomy. There is a single \nclip in the left lateral mid abdomen. \nIMPRESSION: No evidence of obstruction or ileus. \n\n___ TTE:\nThe left atrial volume is markedly increased (>32ml\/m2). The \ninteratrial septum is aneurysmal. Left ventricular wall \nthickness, cavity size and regional\/global systolic function are \nnormal (LVEF >55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall \nmotion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly \nthickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic \nregurgitation is seen.

Persistent mild \ncongestive heart \nfailure and bilateral lower lobe air space consolidation. \n.\n___ digoxin level 1.8, WBC 3.8, HCT 28, Na 140, K 4.4, HCO 33, \nCr 0.6, BUN 12\n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nHYPOTENSION:\nUltimately Ms. ___ hypotension was thought to be due to \nprofound volume depletion in the setting of poor ___ intake.  Her \nbaseline SBP was noted to be low in the 100's, according to \nout-patient records. On arrival she was admitted to the ICU. She \nwas started on vancomycin and zosyn for presumed sepsis, though \nshe remained afebrile and no infectious source was identified \n(CXR was unremarkable, abd exam benign, UA\/UCx negative, no \ndiarrhea, no skin lesions).  MAPS's were maintained greater than \n65 on norepinephrine upon admission.  She was gradually weaned \nfrom pressors by ___ and maintained SBP in the 90-100 range \nwhile awake (pressures dropped slightly to the 80's while \nsleeping).  \n.\nOther causes of hypotension were ruled out.  There was no \nevidence of bleeding.  She has known hypothyroidism and is on \nlevothyroxine, but TSH\/free T4 were normal.  She was not \nadrenally insufficient, as she passed a CortStim test.  TTE did \nnot show worsening valvular disease or focal wall motion \nabnormalities; although she had a slight troponin elevation on \nadmission, CK-MB fractions were normal and there was no evidence \nof ischemia on EKG's.  PE was considered unlikley given the \npatient's supratherapeutic INR on admission and good \noxygenation.\n.\nShe was transfered to the medical floor the first time on \n___. She remained asymptomatic there but relatively \nhypotensive. On ___, she received a dose of zyprexa prior to an \nMRI, and her SBP was noted to be drop to the ___. She also has \nfound to have a UTI in the setting of this hypotension. She \nreceived 2L NS with improvement to the ___, and was transferred \nback to the ICU, where levophed was again initiated.  During her \nsecond ICU ___ she was also aggressively diuresed as she had \nevidence ___ body volume overload and anasarca. With her \nknown 4+ MR, it was felt that afterload reduction would improve \nher hemodynamics. She also received a transfusion of 1 unit of \npRBCs to boost her intravascular oncotic pressure. She was \nslowly weaned down off pressors by ___. Of note, she had no \nevidence of hypoperfusion as evidenced by venous lactates of 1.1 \ndespite a MAP in the ___ on one occasion.\n.\nShe was transfered but to the medical floor on ___ where her \nblood pressure remained stable on midodrine with occasional \nbrief hypotensive episodes to the upper ___. Even at these \npressures mental status and urine output were maintained. \nDiuresis with bolus IV lasix was continued and then transfered \nto ___. However it was discontinued on ___ because of increased \nautodiuresis and worsening tachycardia. With improved afib \ncontrol with amio and dig her blood pressures improved to \n120\/80s. When a steady state if dig is reached, downtritration \nof midodrine showed be considered.\n.\nFAILURE TO THRIVE, PEG TUBE PLACEMENT:\nMs. ___ has been noted by family members, group home members \nand her out-pateint doctors to have had FTT over the ___ several \nmonths with profound behavioral changes, including withdrawal \nand refusal to eat.  Within the last year, she had been given a \ndiagnosis of Alzheimer's Dementia (confirmed with neurologist \nDr. ___ in ___).  Per Dr. ___ \nmedical ___ for dementia and behavioral change had been \nnegative, although it was difficult to obtain imaging studies as \nan out-patient due to the patient's inabilit to cooperate with \nthe tests.  Head CT was performed on ___ in-house to complete \na dementia ___ and showed no acute bleed or mass effect, but \nlarge ___ & ___ ventricles.  \n\nOn admission, an NG tube was placed to deliver nutrition \n(albumin was noted to be 2.1), although the patient pulled out \nthe NGT.  Multiple conversations were had with the patient's HCP \n(her brother ___ and sister-in-law about goals of care and the \nfamily's wishes.  It was decided that she should have a PEG tube \nplaced for feeding given her refusal to eat (throughout the \nadmission she refused ___ intake and medications, as well as \nmouth care).  The surgical service placed a PEG tube on ___ \nwithout complication.  Medications were switched to ___ and tube \nfeedings were started on ___. \n\nAfter transfer to the floor Ms ___ had an episode of \nhypoglyemia even with ongoing Tube feeds without residuals. \nFinger sticks were monitored, however no further hypoglyemia was \nnoted.\n.\nASPIRATION PNEUMONIA:\nDuring her second MICU stay she remained on TFs via her PEG \ntube. She did become nauseated and vomited x 1 on ___, with an \nassociated desaturation and increased O2 requirement. It was \nfelt c\/w an aspiration event, and subsequent CXRs were c\/w \naspiration. She was begun on an empiric course of Vanc\/Zosyn for \na possible HAP x 10 day course (___). She was \naggressively diuresed for concern of ARDS, but her O2 \nreuqirement was easily weaned back to baseline. Her paxil was \nd\/c'ed out of concern for any contribution to an altered mental \nstatus.\n.\nATRIAL FIBRILLATION:\nThe patient was on sotalol and warfarin as an out-patient.  INR \nwas 11.3 on admission likely from poor nutritional status.  She \nwas given Vitamin K 5 mg and warfarin was held on admission with \ngradual improvement in INR.  Sotalol was held while not taking \n___ medications; no other rate controlling agents were started \ngiven hypotension, and HR was generally in the 80-90 BPM range.  \nBy ___, her HR had started to climb to the 110-120's with \noccassional increases to the 130-140's (BP remained stable \nduring these episodes).  She was started on IV amiodarone for \nrhythm control on ___ with good effect.  After placement of \nthe PEG tube, she was started on amiodarone 400 mg TID which was \nlater deceased to 200 mg ___ once a loading dose was finished. \n Warfarin  was started on ___.  On ___ tachycardia worsening \nand unresponsive to metoprolol and fluids. Amio was increased to \n400mg ___ and Digoxin was loaded with 0.25mg x 4 IV. This load \nresulted in improved HR control with HR in 80-90s and a large \nincrease IN BPs to 120s\/80s. She is to continue on dig at .125mg \n___. Please have her blood drawn on ___ to \nmeasure her digoxin level. Fax this result to Dr. ___ at \n___ (office phone ___ and obtain \nrecommendation from him regarding dosage changes of this \nmedication. Dr. ___, her long-standing cardiologist, was \naware of the plan to anticoagulate and discharge on ___ \namiodarone and Dig.  He plans to electrically cardiovert in ___ \nweeks after discharge. At the time of d\/c INR had diped to 1.6 \nafter decreasing the dose in the setting of a previously rising \nINR to 2.7. On ___ coumadin was adjusted to previous home dose \nof 1 mg ___. INR is anticipated to rising quickly with this \nadjustment and subsequent increase in amiodarone dosage. INR \nshould continue to be monitored closely.\n\nACUTE RENAL FAILURE:\nGiven history and lab studies, ARF on admission was supsected to \nbe pre-renal in etiology.  In addition to poor ___ intake, she \nwas noted to be on lasix when admitted.  Her baseline creatinine \nfrom ___ was around 1.0, but Cr was 3.4 on admission (with \nBUN 86).  UA\/UCx were negative for infection.  Cr improved to \n0.7 with aggressive hydration. Cr remained stable during her \nlater aggressive diuresis. \n.\nA foley has been in place to prevent decub infection and left in \nat time of transfer. Upon arrival foley should be removed and a \nvoiding trail performed. After ___ void or after 12 hr (which \never comes first) please perform a bladder scan and reinsert \nfoley for residual urine > 450 cc.\n\nUTI:\nE coli urinary tract infection was noted on ___ culture and IV \ncipro was started for a 3 day course\n\nHYPOTHYROIDISM:\nPatient was euthyroid on admission (see above).  She was \ncontinued on levothyroxine 37.5 mcg IV (equivalent to home dose \nof 75 mcg ___ while not taking ___ in-house.  She was changed \nbacked to ___ thyroid replacement. TFTs and PFTs should be \nmonitored as an outpatient with the addition of amiodarone. \n\nQUESTION OF SEIZURE DISORDER, ON DEPAKOTE:\nPatient with unclear history of seizure disorder; home \nmedication list on admission listed trileptal and depakote.  \nHistory was clarified with home neurologist, Dr. ___ \n___, who said patient was on these medications for mood \nstabilization and has no known seizure disorder.  Dr. ___ \n___ initially tried her on triletptal, but this gave her \nhyponatremia; she was later changed to depakote.  While \nin-house, she was maintained on the equivalent dosage of \nvalproic acid because she was not taking ___.  If her mood \nworsens may consider restarted home doses of depakote and \ntrileptal\n\nMental staus: Her mental status has rapidly deterioated over the \nlast year, and PTA was not oriented, responding only with moans \nand simple words. She was diagnosed with alzhemers by her \nneurologist prior to admission. In house a paxil trial has \nattempted, to see if depression treatement would improve mental \nstatus. No improvement was seen and paxil was later d\/ced for \nfear that in was overly sedating. Imaging showed She has \nextensive atrophy of her medial temporal lobes and hippocampus. \nShe also has extensive regions of brain infarction and \nleukoencephalopathy both frontally and cerebellar. Neuro was \nconsulted for management and evaluation for possible \ncommunicating hydrocephalus. Per neuro the hydrocephalus is \nexplained by two preocesses- 1) ex vacuo due to atrophy and \ninfarction of brain tissue and 2) loss of white matter firmness \nand support leads to  further ventricular enlargement. These \nprocesses are not improved by shunting which carries a \nsubstantial risk. Neuro strongly favored not performing an LP or \nconsidering placement of a shunt.  Secondly, her history of \nsedatives before MRI leading to profound hypotension is another \nrisk that may outweigh any benefit.\n.\nPENDING ISSUES FOR ___:\n(1) Needs to follow up with cardiologist Dr. ___  for \n___ and possible elective electric cardioversion and dig \nmanagement\n(2) Patient was discharged on warfarin with goal INR of 2.0 - \n3.0.  INR should be followed closely as recently increased amio \ncould alter metabolism\n(3) Needs a ___ appointment with her PCP ___ ___ weeks \nfollowing rehab discharge.\n(4) Further management of midodrine, and mood stabilizers should \nbe considered\n \nMedications on Admission:\nHome Medications:\n(per office visit note faxed over)\n- Coumadin 1 mg ___\n- Senna 8.6 mg ___\n- Sotalol 120 mg BID\n- Potassium Chloride 40 mEq ___\n- Lasix 40 mg ___\n- Ketaconazole as needed\n- Triamcinolone cream as needed\n- Prilosec 20 mg BID\n- Bacitracin ointment PRN\n- Amoxicillin prior to dental procedures\n- Levothyroxine 75 mcg\n- Lorazepam 1 mg prior to medical procedures\n- Depakote 1500 mg ___\n- Trileptal 300 mg BID\n\n \nDischarge Medications:\n1.

He has been weaning of TPN \nsince starting it for recurrent candidal esophagitis. He denies \nfevers, chills, chest pain, SOB, or dysuria.  \n\nDuring his hospitalization from ___, he was admitted \nfor acute onset abdominal pain related to cellulitis from his \ndraining enterocutaneous fistulas, seen to have progressed by \nCT. This improved with antibiotics (Vanc, Zosyn, and Flagyl), \nbut his course was complicated by Bacillus cereus bacteremia, \nfelt to be secondary to an infected ___ line site. TTE was \nclear. He received an increased dose of Humira for this presumed \n___ flare. Pain was controlled with his home regimen of \nmethadone standing and hydromorphone PRN. On the day of \ndischarge, his creatinine was at his baseline of around 2.0.  \nHis physicians were contacted by the infusion company regarding \nhis routine blood work, reporting that his creatinine on ___ \nwas 2.5 and his Vanco trough was 15.8. The following day, his \ncreatinine continued to increase, up to 5.2 the day prior to \nadmission, with a Vanco trough of 25.9.

Given the recent B. Cereus bacteremia, pt \nreports decrease in his appetite and low PO intake. His urine \nsodium of <10 and FeNa of well under 1% was also suggestive of a \npre-renal state along with the 2L of normal saline he received \nat the OSH that improved his creatinine. His Cr further improved \nwith fluids and better PO intake. Additionally, he was on IV \nzosyn and IV vancomycin for treatment of the bacteremia, and so \nthe zosyn was discontinued during this hopsitalization. \nTherefore, his improvement in creatinine is confounded by this \nas well.  His latest vancomycin trough from the infusion company \nwas slightly elevated, but does not appear to be enough to cause \na significant amount of nephrotoxicity. Given his ___, his \nvancomycin dosing was initially changed to 1gm q48hrs, but as \nhis Cr improved, he was discharged on 1gm q24hrs to continue \nthrough ___ to complete a 14-day course. He was also continued \non his fluconazole and discharged with this as well, to continue \nfor 7 days after the completion of his antibiotic course. He \nwill be seeing Dr. ___ on ___, at which time his \nvancomycin levels and renal function will be re-assessed.   \n\nCHRONIC ISSUES\n# ___ disease and enterocutaneous fistulas c\/b cellulitis: \nPt had continued drainage from the fistulas, which is likely \ncontributing to the raw skin as well as the pre-renal state. \nMalabsorption and losses in the stool have likely led to his \nhypokalemia, which may need daily supplementation. However, his \nabdomen did not appear infected, and so zoysn was discontinued \nas above. No changes to his recently increased Humira dosage was \nmade. \n  \n# Chronic pain - Pt was continued on methadone with dilaudid for \nbreakthrough pain.\n\n# GERD - Pt was on lansoprazole while in-house and discharged on \nhis home medication of Prevacid\n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES\n# Recommend checking creatinine to assess his kidney function \nand assure improvement\n# Recommend checking vancomycin levels to assure therapeutic \nlevels and dose re-adjustment as necessary\n# Recommend follow-up of pending blood cultures\n \nMedications on Admission:\n1. methadone 50 mg qAM  \n2. methadone 50 mg q 10am  \n3. methadone 40 mg q 2pm  \n4. multivitamin daily  \n5. hydromorphone 2 mg q6h PRN breakthrough pain  \n6. fluconazole 100 mg daily (for 1 week after completion of abx) \n \n7. oxycodone 5 mg q4-6h PRN pain  \n8.

Patient was treated empirically with \nflagyl at half the normal dose (250mg TID) in setting of \nreceiving peritoneal dialysis.  However, patient began noting \nresolution of symptoms soon after admission.  He had one loose \nBM on floor on hospital day 1 but thereafter reported that he no \nlonger had loose diarrhea.  He denied abdominal pain, nausea and \nvomiting throughout hospital stay.  Stool was sent for C.diff \ntoxin and was negative x 3.  Flagyl was then discontinued.  \nInitial diarrhea may have been due to adverse effects of \nantibiotics on GI system in general.  Of note, patient also has \nhx of irritable bowel syndrome with ___ BMs daily during \nexacerbations.  This episode may have represented one of these \nexacerbations.  \n.\n#Osteomyelitis: \nPatient was recently admitted ___ with osteomyelitis \nof the right ___ digit for which he was receiving ertapenem \n(total 6 week course).  While in house, ertapenem was switched \nto meropenem and he continued to receive IV antibiotics through \nhis PICC line.  He remained afebrile throughout hospital course. \n WBC was elevated, from 11.9 on admisison to 13.4 on discharge \nbut was stably high throughout the admission.  This could \nrepresent WBC elevation from osteomyelitis.  At discharge, he \ndid not complain of any pain or swelling of right hand.  He was \nseen by plastic surgery who recommended that he remain in the \nsplint for activities, when out of bed, during sleep, and \nwhenever possible to protect the finger.  He should continue wet \nto dry dressings.  He has a scab on his right knee which should \nhave routine wound care at the ___.\n.  \n#ESRD:  \nPatient has history of ESRD and was continued on his peritoneal \ndialysis throughout his hospital stay.  We also continued \nnephrocaps, prednisone, doxercalciferol, epo, and sevelamer at \nhome dosages.  We also sent peritoneal dialysis fluid for \nanalysis given elevated WBC.  Dialysis fluid, including gram \nstain and culture, were unremarkable and did not indicate any \ninfection.  \n.  \n#HTN:  \nPatient was known to have history of autonomic dysfunction.  His \nblood pressures remained labile during hospital stay, peaking in \nthe 200s systolic and dipping in the ___.  Blood pressures \ntended to be elevated when the patient was lying down and \ndecreased upon standing, consistent with his autonomic \ndysfunction.  He was continued on his metoprolol 25mg BID.  \nAfter discussion with renal consult, lisinopril was also added \nto his regimen, initially at 2.5mg daily and then increased to \n5mg as BPs continued to remain high.  \n.  \n#DM: \nPatient had a novolog insulin pump that was continued during \nhospital course.    ___ diabetes consult was obtained for his \nelevated blood sugars, which peaked in the 500s.  After \nincreasing the settings on his insulin pump, his blood sugars \nwere better managed, ranging 144-200 on day of discharge.  Of \nnote, his last A1c of 8.5 from ___ shows that he has \nsuboptimal control at baseline.   He was advised to follow-up \nwith his outpatient ___ providers for optimization of \ndiabetes management. \n.\n***ABNORMAL CXR FINDING: A CXR PA\/LAT was done to access the \nlocation of his PICC line on ___.  There was a :small faint \nopacity in the right lower\nlobe could represent atelectasis or developing infection and \nfollowup is\nrecommended.

There is no aortic \nvalve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral \nvalve leaflets are mildly thickened. Physiologic mitral \nregurgitation is seen (within normal limits). There is moderate \npulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial \neffusion. \nIMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Normal left ventricular \ncavity size with regional systolic dysfunction c\/w CAD (distal \nLAD distribution). Moderate pulmonary artery systolic \nhypertension. \nCLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: \nBased on ___ AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the \necho findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical \ndecisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on \nclinical and echocardiographic data.   \n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nMr ___ is an ___ man with history of hypertension, \nhyperlipidemia, chronic renal insufficiency, presenting with \nsyncope and found to have STEMI.   \n.  \n# Sycope: The cause of his sycope on presentation was thought to \nbe most likely orthostatic hypotension with cerebral \nhypoperfusion given his cerebrovascular disease.  Carotid \nultrasound showed 40-59% stenosis of the internal carotid \narteries bilaterally. He had no further syncopal episodes while \nin house. \n.\n# STEMI:  Patient initially had positive enyzmes and ST \nelevations v2-v6.  He was given ASA, Plavix, Beta blocker, \nheparin gtt.  He was prehydrated for catheterization. \n.\nOn ___, repeat EKG showed STE in lateral leads.  Enzymes \nwere trended and flat. Pt did not have symptoms. Decision was \nmade to send pt to cardiac cath on ___, demonstrating severe \n3 vessel disease. At that point, cardiac surg was consulted for \nCABG. However, during the morning of ___, pt complained of \nback pain and STE returned in his lateral leads. Patient was \nsent again to the cath lab for balloon pump and then transfer to \nthe CCU.\n.\nIn the ccu, the decision was made not to pursue CABG given \nmultiple medical comorbidities.  The patient remained free of \nchest pain.  Medical management including clopidogrel, full dose \naspirin, beta blocker, and high dose statin were undertaken.  He \nwas weaned off the intra-aortic balloon pump and it was removed. \nHe had a femoral bruit, so US was done which showed no evidence \nof pseudoaneurysm.  \n.\nRegarding his coronary disease, the plan was to wait until renal \nfailure resolved and then consider repeat catheterization for \nrevascularization of his LAD.  He would need to have this done \nbefore any urologic procedure (as below).\n.\n# Acute on chronic renal insufficiency: Creatinine on admission \nwas near baseline of 2. After catheterizations, creatinine rose \nto a high of 5.4.  The most likely cause was contrast-induced \nATN. He was hydrated, and renal function improved slowly.  \nCreatinine on discharge was 3.2.  \n.\n# GI bleed:  In the CCU, the patient had guaiac positive stools \nand reported a history of melena.  He was given pRBC to maintain \nHct >28.  GI did an upper endoscopy that showeed erosive \ngastritis and duodenitis, likely the source of bleeding.  He was \ngiven BID PPI.  Per GI, this would not preclude heparinization \nfor cardiac procedure if needed.  \n.\n# Renal mass:  On non-contrast abdominal CT, patient was found \nto have a 4 cm L renal mass that was confirmed by ultrasound to \nbe solid.  The urology team evaluated the patient and \nrecommended outpatient follow-up for MR with gadolinium after \nrenal function improves.  After speaking with his nephrologist \n(Dr. ___ at ___, he should NOT get MR \nwith gadolinium at any point but should instead have a contrast \nCT after kidney function improves. He could potentially undergo \nresection, after LAD is revascularized, if the disease is \nlocalized.\n.\n# Mild Chronic Systolic heart Failure: Echo from outside \nhospital showed overall mildly depressed EF of 40-45% but with \nfocal wall motion abnormality.  He was on lasix as an outpatient \nwhich was held because of acute renal failure.  On discharge, he \nwill need to have daily weights and reinstitution of diuretics \nas needed.  \n.  \n# Hypertension: The patient had a history of chronic \nhypertension, likely exacerbated by not taking his clonidine the \nmorning of admission.  He initially received a nitro drip, \ntransitioning to hydralazine and later to home medications \nincluding beta blocker, amlodipine, and clonidine (changed from \ntablet to patch).  Lisinopril was held for renal failure.  He \nwas normotensive on this regimen.  \n.\n# Left orbital edema: The patient had left orbital edema on \nadmission.  Head CT at ___ negative for fracture, no point \ntenderness on exam. The edema resolved within days.\n.  \n# Leukocytosis:  The patient briefly developed leukocytosis.  \nCXR showed a possible L lower lobe infiltrate.  He was afebrile \nand asymptomatic, and the leukocytosis resolved within days.  \nThe most likely cause was aspiration pneumonitis.  He should be \nobserved while eating until his mental status improves to \nbaseline.\n.\n# Hypernatremia:  Sodium the day of discharge was slightly \nelevated at 148.  This will need to be followed at the rehab \nfacility.\n \nMedications on Admission:\nALLOPURINOL - 300 mg Tablet - ___ Tablet(s) by mouth once a day  \n\nAMLODIPINE [NORVASC] - 5 mg Tablet daily  \nCLONIDINE - 0.2 mg Tablet - 1 Tablet(s) by mouth twice a day  \nEPOETIN ALFA [PROCRIT] - 10,000 unit\/mL Solution - 1 ml Qweek -  \n\ndispense 1ml single use vials  \nFUROSEMIDE - 40 mg Tablet - 1 Tablet(s) by mouth twice a day  \nLISINOPRIL - 40 mg Tablet - 1 Tablet(s) by mouth once a day  \nMETOPROLOL SUCCINATE [TOPROL XL] - 200 mg daily  \nSIMVASTATIN - 10 mg Tablet daily  \nFERROUS GLUCONATE - 324 mg (36 mg) daily  \n\n \nDischarge Medications:\n1.

Small 6 mm acute to subacute infarct of the left temporal \nlobe.  No \nassociated mass effect. \n2. Numerous chronic infarcts of the cerebral white matter, \nbilateral basal \nganglia, and thalami.  Severe chronic microangiopathy. \n3. Moderate generalized parenchymal volume loss. \n4. Asymmetric enlargement of the right temporal horn, although \nthis appears to \nbe due to adjacent temporal lobe volume loss rather than \nspecifically volume \nloss of the right hippocampus. \n5. Occlusion of the V4 segment of the right vertebral artery, \nunchanged from \nCTA on ___. \n\nEEG:\nThis telemetry captured no pushbutton activations. It showed a \nslow background throughout, indicative of a widespread \nencephalopathy. \nMedications, metabolic discharges, and infection are among the \nmost common causes. In addition, there was prominent delta \nslowing broadly over the left hemisphere, suggestive of an \nadditional subcortical dysfunction there. Minimal slowing was \nevident on the right. There were no epileptiform features or \nelectrographic seizures. \n\nThis telemetry captured one pushbutton activation for an episode \n\nof confusion. There was no electrographic correlate. Otherwise, \nit showed \nprominent delta slowing over the left hemisphere suggestive of \nfocal cerebral dysfunction. In addition, the background was slow \nand disorganized throughout suggestive of a widespread \nencephalopathy which is non-specific with regard to etiology. \nThere were no epileptiform features or electrographic seizures. \n\nCT Head and Neck:\n1. No evidence for acute intracranial abnormalities on \nnoncontrast head CT.  \nNondiagnostic CT perfusion study due to technical factors. \n2. Multiple chronic infarcts are again seen in the right \nthalamus, left \ncaudate, and left  lentiform nucleus\/corona radiata\/external \ncapsule. \n3. No flow-limiting arterial stenosis in the neck. \n4. Unchanged atherosclerotic occlusion of the distal V4 segment \nof the non \ndominant right vertebral artery. \n5. Bronchiectasis in the visualized upper lungs with apparent \nnew bronchial \nwall thickening compared to ___, which may represent \nsuperimposed \ninfectious\/inflammatory process versus technical differences.  \nClinical \ncorrelation is recommended. \n6. Severe cervical spinal stenosis, previously assessed by MRI \nin ___. \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nMr. ___ is an ___ year old left handed man who presented with \nisolated global aphasia similar to a prior MRI-negative episode \nin ___ thought to be seizure vs stroke. \n\nInitially, given the exam and the identical nature of his \ncurrent aphasia to an MRI-negative spell in ___, seizure \nwas higher consideration than stroke. However, EEG showed no \nepileptiform activity.  It showed left greater than right \nslowing.  Previous EEG showed right greater than left slowing. \nHowever, due to the clinical suspicion for seizure, whether of \nunknown etiology or secondary to stroke, we have increased his \nKeppra 1000mg BID.  Although the initial CT was negative, an MRI \nshowed a small posterior insular cortex.  His stroke risk \nfactors have been assessed.  He is currnetly on Atorvastatin \n40mg qday.  His last LDL was 66.  He has afib and is currently \non Coumadin 2mg with theurapeutic INRs.  His INR on discharge \nwas 3.1.  His INR will continue to be trended by his primary \ncare doctor.  We were going to obtain an Echo since his last \nEcho was ___, however, the result will not change management.  \nHe will follow up with his outpatient Neurologist.   \n\nIn regards to pulmonary, Mr. ___ had some wheezing on inital \nexam that improved throughout the hospital course.  He had a CTA \nthat showed bronchiectasis visualized in the upper lungs with \napparent new bronchial wall thickening compared to ___, which may represent superimposed infectious\/inflammatory \nprocess.  Mr. ___ did endorse a recent viral illness.   \n\nAdditionally, Mr. ___ was found to have pancytopenia of unknown \netiology.  The pancytopenia improved over the course of the \nhospitalization.  He will follow up with his outpatient primary \ncare doctor.\n \nMedications on Admission:\n1. Warfarin 2 mg PO DAILY16 \n2. LeVETiracetam 750 mg PO BID \n3. Citalopram 20 mg PO DAILY \n4.
