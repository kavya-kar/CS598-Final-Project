      "As you know, you were admitted because you were having blood in your urine which happened because you are on coumadin and had a foley catheter in your last hospital stay. You did not loose a significant amount of blood and bleeding resolved. We noted that you have a urinary tract infection which we are treating with antibiotics. You will need to continue taking antibiotics for 2 more days after leaving the hospital. We noted that you had a large amount of fluid in your stomach and treated you with medication (furosemide and metolazone) to decrease this fluid. We examined your heart using an ultrasound and noted that your heart does not squeeze as hard as it did a few months ago which is related to heart failure. We performed a cardiac catheterization to evaluate your heart failure and concluded that you would best benefit from changing your pacemaker.\n",
      "You were admitted with shortness of breath and cough due to lung cancer metastasis, requiring procedures like pericardial window creation and drainage for malignant pericardial effusion. You also had a pulmonary embolism and a right anterior/apical pneumothorax during your hospital stay. Upon discharge, you were stable with oxygen support and scheduled for outpatient follow-ups.\n",

      "You were admitted for nausea and vomiting, likely exacerbated by a hiatal hernia. Thoracic surgery recommended a fundoplication surgery for your hiatal hernia, which will be scheduled as an outpatient procedure. You were also managed for your chronic conditions like GERD, hypertension, and dyslipidemia during your hospitalization.\n",

      "Lastly, you were admitted for a urinary tract infection and worsening congestive heart failure with systolic and diastolic dysfunction. Your heart failure was managed with diuretics, and plans were made for a pacemaker upgrade in the future. You were also treated for anemia, atrial fibrillation, and other chronic conditions. Upon discharge, you were stable but required assistance with ambulation. Follow-up appointments and medication adjustments were arranged for your ongoing care.\n",
