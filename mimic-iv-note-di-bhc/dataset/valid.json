Initially though to represent demand ischemia and cardiology consulted who recommended ASA, metoprolol, statin and transfuse additional 2 units pRBCs. Due to recent GI bleed, GI consulted. EGD showed no active bleeding and thought that it was acceptable to start anticoagulation with heparin gtt as concern for NSTEMI. After transfusion patient continued to have rise in troponin and persistent EKG changes, and felt patient most likely with true NSTEMI. Troponins started to trend downwards and patient transferred to Cardiology service for potential cardiac catheterization. Cardiac catheterization was not persued in the setting of GI bleed. The decision was made to medically manage the patient. Lisinopril was uptitrated and Imdur was started and uptitrated. EKGs were serially monitored through the admission with his T-wave inversions improving during this admission, but persistent in I, aVL, V4-V6 as well as II, aVF.

On ___, he developed nausea in the morning and gradually became dyspneic with a new cough over the course of the day. In the evening, he developed dull, left-sided chest pain and vomiting and was felt to be diaphoretic. An ECG revealed new inferolateral ST depressions and his cTnT was 0.13. Cardiology was consulted for NSTEMI. He was started on ASA and a heparin drip, but cardiology consult service did not feel a LHC was warranted given likely type II STEMI at the time, as well as ___ on transplanted kidney. His respiratory distress gradually increased through the AM on ___, and he was started on BiPAP. A TTE on ___ showed new LAD-territory wall motion abnormalities. He was started on vanc\/cefepime\/azithromycin out of concern for pneumonia, and ID was consulted given his renal transplant history. He received IV Lasix boluses up to 200mg and sublingual nitroglycerine x2. He was found to have ___, with peak Cr 2.3 on ___ ___ 1.5-1.9) which improved somewhat with diuresis. He was weaned off bipap ___ and transferred to the floor. On the floor he was started on an IV lasix drip and his dyspnea and oxygen requirements gradually improved. Given improving renal function, he underwent coronary angiography where two DES were placed in the RCA with plan for interval stenting of LAD lesion in two weeks time. He was euvolemic at time of discharge with stable renal function for two days off of diuretics, and was therefore discharged off of diuretics. If weight gain, hypoxemia, lower extremity edema, consider IV diuresis (has required 200mg IV Lasix and gtt at 20\/hr). Continue ASA, Plavix, rosuvastatin, and metoprolol. ___ on CKD s\/p renal transplant: Initially, the patient had increased Cr in the setting of volume overlaod and poor systolic cardiac function making a cardiorenal syndrome a likely cause. He subsequently had aggressive diuresis with improvement in Cr. (baseline Cr is 1.2-1.4). He subsequently had rising Cr post-cath suggesting some contrast nephropathy.

{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: Mr. ___ is a ___ year old male with history of chronic alcohol use who presented to ___ on ___ with a pre-syncopal episode associated with diaphoresis, pallor, tremulousness found to have serum + for EtOH. . Active Issues: . #Pre-syncope: Differential diagnosis of his presyncopal event includes vasovagal, cardiogenic, orthostatic, or drug effect. Patient endorsed prodrome of lightheadedness, diaphoresis, pallor that occurred over minutes that supports vasovagal syncope. This was likely exacerbated by his recent alcohol use (serum tox level was 51 on admission)and he was possibly somewhat volume depleted given his ketonuria. Initial physical exam showed diaphoresis, tremulousness, and cerebellar signs consistent with alcohol intoxication\/early withdrawal. ___ in ED was WNL, so hypoglycemia was unlikely contributing factor. Had a similar, but less severe episode ont he commuter rail 2 weeks ago, also after a weekend of drinking EtOH. His episode did not occur after rising to standing position so unlikely to be orthostatic syncope. Cardiogenic syncope (arrhythmia, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy) was considered less likely given that he did not lose consiousness suddenly and did not have a true LOC. He underwent an ECG which showed normal sinus rhythm with left axis deviation as well as left ventricular hypertrophy and was placed on telemetry which demonstrated no electrical abnormalities. There was no evidence on history or physical exam to suggest seizure or TIA as cause. . #EtOH Abuse\/Tobacco use: Patient reported drinking ___ cups of vodka daily for the past ___s having recent alcohol use with serum tox positive for alcohol on admission. Therefore, there was concern for withdrawal and he was placed on a CIWA scale, although did not require any diazepam and manifested only mild tremulousness. He was started on folic acid 1 mg QD and thiamine 100 mg QD daily and will be discharged on these as well. He was also placed on a nicotine patch given his significant tobacco use and supplied with prescriptions for nicotine patch and gum. . #Gait disturbance: Patient describes feeling unsteady on his feet, particularly in shower and when he closes his eyes that has developed slowly over past year. His neuro exam was notable for proprioceptive loss in b\/l toes, and wide-based gait with short steps, with an inability to tandem walk which was consistent with a sensory ataxia (disturbance of the dorsal columns or of peripheral nerves). This was thought to be secondary to a direct toxic alcoholic peripheral neuropathy complicated by concurrent nutritional deficiencies, although vitamin B12 level was normal. He was started on thiamine and informed that his alcohol use was the likely cause. . #Hypertension: Patient was found to be hypertensive (max 177\/100) while in house and was started on chlorthalidone prior to discharge. He will need follow-up with PCP in next few days to address his blood pressure response. . INACTIVE ISSUES: . #Depression: Patient stated that he has felt depressed over the past year, especially since the loss of his girlfriend ___ year ago. He expressed interest in mental health services and social work was consulted. . #Tongue polyps: Incidentally found over ___ years ago and have not been a significant issue and been stable in size. However given his significant alcohol\/tobacco history, his risk of tongue cancer is increased. THere was no friable tissue on exam and no associated lymphadenopathy. Follow-up of polyps by PCP is ___. . TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: 1. EtOH abuse: Patient drinking large amounts of alcohol daily and would benefit from supportive groups like AA, and continual counseling on the harmful effects of alcohol as an outpatient. 2. Hypertension: Patient started on chlorthalidone while in hospital. Blood pressure response\/screening for side effects as outpatient is needed. 3. Depression: Patient admitted to feelings of sadness over the past year and was interested in speaking with outpatient psychiatrist. Should monitor symptoms of depression, consider treatment with SSRI\/psychotherapy on an outpatient basis. Patient has had an extensive discussion with a social worker, who recommended grief counceling as outpatient. 4. Tongue Polyps: Patient found to have two <1cm polyps on left lateral aspect of tongue. Should monitor growth\/changes as an outpatient. 5. Peripheral Neuropathy: most likely related to chronic ETOH abuse though pt was referred to neurology for outpt follow up and additional work up.","summary":"You were admitted to ___ on ___ due to an episode of lightheadness and near fainting. You were worked up for possible causes of this episode including heart problems, problems with your blood, kidneys, or nerve problems. You underwent an electrocardiogram, which measures the electrical activity of the heart. This showed that part of your heart, the left ventricle, is enlarged (the wall is thicker), but did not show any abnormal rhythms or reasons to believe your episode was due to your heart. You also had a chest x ray which showed that the heart and lungs were normal. You were also found to have high blood pressure, which explains why the left side of your heart is larger (it must pump against a higher pressure)."}

The CTA was negative for PE or pneumonia. The thought was that the patient most likely had an acute COPD exacerbation. He was treated with steroids, inhalers and azithromycin. He was extubated and weaned off of oxygen the day after admission. He maintained oxygenation and was breathing without difficulty or wheezes. We will treat him with a short course of steroids (5 days of prednisone total) and antibiotics. The antibiotics were changed from azithromycin to levofloxacin (due to UTI, see below). Given how rapid he improved, it is likely that another factor caused the lung symptoms.

She was in her usual state of health and was reading the newspaper on ___ when she suddenly had some difficulty \"tracking the lines\". She didn't think she lost her vision or had missing vision. She was able to read the words but does think there was an issue with comprehending the meaning. She has trouble describing what she means by this. She attributed this to just perhaps the small print. She was doing much better reading larger print on her phone. She denies that she ever couldn't read at all. She never had to spell the letters or say them out loud. She has not been bumping into anything on her right and she has been able to drive. She does not think she had any associated weakness, tingling\/numbness, memory issues, dizziness or headache. She thinks she snores. She doesn't have palpitations. She finally had optho appointment today at which time a dense right homonymous hemianopia was noted WITHOUT macular sparing. She was referred to ___. She does report that about a year ago she had an episode of isolated vertical diplopia lasting a minute. Per Atrius records by Dr. ___ occurred while walking down stairs. She had had cataract surgery at some point that year. ESR and CRP were normal. MRI brain with and without contrast, MRA brain\/neck at ___ ___ showed no acute infarct, normal MRAs, tortuous but otherwise normal vertebral arteries. TTE ___ showed LVEF approximately 60%, trace-mild aortic regurgitation, mild mitral regurgitation, no shunt by color Doppler. Holter monitor ___ showed sinus rhythm with sinus arrhythmia, occasional APBs, one run of SVT. The transient diplopia was felt to be possible migraine variant but given possibility of TIA, she was started on ASA. Patient reports she has had several more episodes of vertical diplopia since that initial one. The longest was 10 minute episode about 1 week ago. She woke up at 3AM and noticed it. Seemed the same regardless if she looked right or left; perhaps worse with her head back. This went away and was not associated with any other symptoms. Hospital Course: She was initially admitted to the stroke service, with an initial NIHSS 3 and last known well 2 weeks prior to admission. Her exam was notable for right homonymous hemianopia, mild word finding difficulties, and mild right facial droop. Her initial MRI showed thin cortical diffusion-weighted hyperintense signal along the left parietooccipital lobe and possible potential milder signal along the right parieto-occipital lobe without corresponding signal abnormality on FLAIR or T2. We felt this was highly atypical for stroke given the lack of FLAIR correlate and crossing PCA\/MCA territories. We evaluated for whether she could have an occipital seizure with an EEG. The EEG showed frequent delta slowing over the left temporal region, at times sharply contoured, with rare LRDAs. There was also asymmetric PDR on the left side indicating occipital dysfunction, and GRDA indicating mild encephalopathy, but no clear electrographic seizures or epileptiform discharges. Therefore, seizure was felt to be extremely unlikely. We also evaluated and ruled out cortical venous thrombosis and PRES (no risk factors). She was transferred to the general neurology service for further workup as her presentation was not thought to be vascular in nature. We then considered MELAS given her history of idiopathic sensorineural hearing loss, and sent metabolic and genetic testing. Her visual symptoms continued to progress during the admission with denser right hemianopia, some left visual field involvement, and increased word finding difficulties. Repeat MRI showed evolving and slightly worsening findings: \"Redemonstration of diffusion-weighted hyperintense signal involving the left parietooccipital cortex, with associated decreased ASL perfusion in the left occipital lobe with similar distribution and extent. Interval development of subtle cortical thickening and FLAIR hyperintensity involving the median occipital lobe most likely represents manifestation of the perfusion abnormality.\" Ultimately, we felt that this would be an atypical presentation of MELAS given the lack of resolution of her symptoms, her age at presentation, and her normal lactate (including post-prandial lactate), CK, and minimally elevated pyruvate, with other labs pending at discharge. Given her imaging findings and predominant visual symptoms, we considered ___ variant CJD and sent ___ and RT-QuIC from the CSF, with results pending at discharge. She was also evaluated by Neuro-ophthalmology on ___, and her exam showed Right homonymous hemianopia without significant neglect in the setting of left parietal\/occipital cortical diffusion restriction sparing the white matter and in a non-vascular distribution, simultanagnosia, and progressive cognitive decline, as well as right hypertropia with full ductions, likely decompensated phoria. She was initially started on ASA and Plavix given our first concern for stroke, and she was ultimately discharged on aspirin.

{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: ___ w\/ h\/o bilateral hip replacements, T12 compression fracture and degenerative lumbar disc disease s\/p mechanical fall at home with multiple non-displaced facial fractures complicated by hyponatremia noted at outside hospital without mental status changes. # Hyponatremia: Admitted with hyponatremia to 120. Urine studies with high osmolality, high sodium suggestive of SIADH. TSH normal. Initial urine studies complicated by HCTZ use prior to admission but repeat studies again consistent with SIADH. Patient's sodium improved moderately with 1L fluid restriction though did not return to normal and salt tabs were added. With TID salt tabs, sodium improved to 133 on discharge. Etiology of SIADH thought to be most likely pain given ongoing poorly controlled back pain over last several months. Unlikely to be related to head injury given degree of hyponatremia on admission and lack of evidence of intracranial bleeding on head CT scan. Patient discharged on 1L fluid restriction with TID salt tabs. # Leukopenia: New leukopenia starting ___ with normal differential and without neutropenia. Acute drop in leukocytes most consistent with medication effect, less likely to be malignancy given acuity of change. Pantoprazole was stopped as this can cause marrow suppression. Patient's only new medication on admission was augmentin which does not typically cause leukopenia. Leukocytes trending up on discharge. If they do not normalize, patient would benefit from outpatient heme\/onc consult. # Multiple non-displaced facial fractures s\/p mechanical fall: Fall sounded mechanical as patient did not lose conciousness, had no prodrome and remembers fall occuring. Fall may also have been partially related to narcotic use and hyponatremia. Non-displaced fractures of maxillary sinuses, right orbital floor. Seen by plastics and ACS who did not feel patient needed operative management of fractures. Also seen by opthamology who confirmed normal opthomalogic exam and no need for further opthamologic ___. Patient place on sinus precautions (described in discharge instructions) and completed 5 day course of Augmentin for sinus prophylaxis. Patient did not have significant facial pain throughout admission. Bruising and abrasions healing well on discharge. Patient to ___ with Plastic surgery 2 weeks after fall. Seen by ___ who cleared patient for ambulation with walker. Patient moving in with daughter-in-law at discharge to help prevent falls in the future. # Back Pain: Patient with chronic pain from reported degenerative discs in lumbar spine. Patient with acute onset of pain in ___. She has been on several medications in the past including lyrica, vicodin, lidocaine patches to treat her pain. She was continued on oxycodone and standing tylenol during her admission. Pain service was contacted who recommended gabapentin or flexeril for pain control but given that these are also sedating and place patient at risk of falls, pain regimen of oxycodone\/tylenol and lidocaine patch was continued with plan for pain clinic ___ to discuss non-sedating treatments for degenerative disc disease in this ___ year old female with recent falls. # Hypertension: Patient with diagnosis of hypertension, was taking HCTZ-triamterine at home. Blood pressure moderately well controlled throughout admission off of anti-hypertensives. If need to treat hypertension in future, would favor ACE-I or torsemide given risk of worsening hyponatremia with HCTZ. # Anemia: Stable. Apparently patient has had iron deficiency anemia in past though no evidence of this on our labs (per MCV, RDW). Patient did not show any evidence of bleeding in setting of multiple head injuries with fall. Hematocrit stable during admission.

{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: ___ yo M with recent history of submassive bilateral pulmonary emboli who presented with tachycardia, dyspnea, and supratherapeutic INR. ACTIVE ISSUES # Pulmonary embolism: Ongoing shortness of breath, tachycardia, and hypoxia were highly likely due to recent pulmonary embolism. All of these symptoms were quite mild per patient, and persistence would be expected given high clot burden. Some concern for pulmonary infarction, but concern is low given the mildness of his symptoms. Admission labs were remarkable for INR of 7.5. For this, Coumadin was held on ___. INR was 2.7 on ___. Per discussion with PCP, INR had been close to therapeutic from ___. In light of this, the INR on admission labs was most likely spurious. Coumadin was restarted at 3 mg daily on ___. On ___, INR was 1.8. Given goal INR of ___ and grave consequences of recurrent VTE, patient started on Lovenox bridge which he received teaching for while in hospital. He should continue on Lovenox until he has been therapeutic on Coumadin for 48 hours, which will most likely be early next week. Discussed this with PCP. Patient instructed to go to PCP's office tomorrow for an INR check. CHRONIC ISSUES # Right ventricular failure: TTE from ___ with RV hypokinesis, severe TR, and pulmonary hypertension. Findings are consistent with CTEPH. Patient was without evidence of decompensated right heart failure while in hospital. # Hypertension: Continued home metoprolol. # Depression: Continued home bupropion, citalopram, trazodone, and Seroquel while in the hospital.

{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: Mr. ___ is a ___ y\/o male with a history of poorly controlled DM, HTN, recent frontotemporal dementia\/ALS, who presented with syncope and coughs with eating. # Syncope: The patient presented to the hospital after a witnessed episode of syncope. The differential diagnosis for syncope includes cardiac (arrhythmia, structural heart disease, acute MI), vasovagal, orthostasis, or neurological conditions (seizures, CVA), and metabolic causes (hypoglycemia). Given the clinical picture, concern for seizure was low. Chest xray revealed mild pulmonary edema and moderate cardiomegaly; therefore, an echocardiogram was obtained which basically showed no significant change from prior exam. Head CT was negative for an acute intracranial process. It was decided that the patient should be admitted to the hospital for overnight monitoring. The patient was placed on cardiac telemetry and no abnormalities were noted. In addition, EKG and two sets of troponins ruled out an acute MI. Since the patient has poorly controlled IDDM, BPH treated with tamsulosin, had come out of a shower prior to the syncope, seemed clammy and progressively became unresponsive, it is most likely that he had orthostasis or vasovagal episode. He also may have been hypoglycemic at the time as he did not have anything to eat for a while after getting his 58 units of NPH. IV fluid bolus was not given because he seemed euvolemic on exam and showed mild pulmonary edema on chest xray. Orthostatic blood pressures in the hospital was normal and he had no further syncope or presyncope. # Frontotemporal dementia \/ ALS: Patient has been experiencing rapid and profound deterioration in cognitive function, mood, and speech over the past 6 months. Decline in cognitive function dates as far back as ___ years. He was recently seen by Dr. ___ in ___ Neurology Unit on ___ his care will be transferred to Dr. ___ as Dr. ___ is leaving the practice. He has been completely dependent for ADLs and IADLs and is minimally verbal. Patient and family members have been reporting that he has difficulty swallowing in general and especially liquids. In the hospital, we obtained a neurology, physical therapy, speech and swallow service consult. A video oropharyngeal swallow study was obtained which showed silent aspiration to thin liquid and nectar consistency. After discussion with patient and his family, the value they placed on his comfort and desire to eat outweighed potential dangers and they agreed to allow him to continue a diet with safety modifications understanding the risks of aspiration. Recommendations are to pre-thicken all liquids and foods prior to eating and to crush medications and mix in apple cause or puree. He will followup in ALS and Cognitive Neurology clinic as scheduled for further evaluation and discussion for nutritional plan going forward. Topic of feeding tube was broached but family is not yet ready to pursue this step. Family did see neurology and all members were made aware of likely ALS diagnosis. # Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus: Patient has poorly controlled insulin dependent diabetes mellitus with last HgbA1c of 10.5 on ___. A hypoglycemic episode may have been a possible contributing factor in causing his syncope leading to this hospitalization. Patient did not eat anything after receiving his morning insulin dose until the episode of syncope. However, given that he returned to baseline soon within a minute after lying on the floor is not consistent with hypoglycemia. While in the hospital, patient was given 54 units of NPH QAM and a sliding scale of insulin QID. Patient and family members were educated on hypoglycemia and not to have the patient go without eating for long after receiving his insulin. # Thrombocytopenia: On initial CBC, patient's platelet count was 95,000. In the past year, patient's platelet count has been ranging between 74,000 and 108,000. This was viewed to be a chronic problem and given no evidence nor concern for active bleeding, we did not pursue further workup during this hospitalization. Outpatient work up can be considered depending on patient's overall picture and multiple competing, life threatening medical problems. # Hypertension: Patient's blood pressure has been WNL and stable throughout hospitalization. We continued his home antihypertensive medications which included atenolol, lisinopril, and hydrochlorothiazide. # BPH: Patient has history of BPH. This was not an active issue during this hospitalization and tamsulosin was continued throughout the hospital course. . TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: 1. Discuss nutritional plan and other medical concerns as patient's neurological disease progress at followup. 2. Follow up with ___ clinic in ___ with possible rescheduling if there is a cancellation","summary":"You were admitted to the hospital after an episode of syncope at home. Laboratory, imaging, and EKG studies showed that you did not have a heart attack, bleeding or stroke in the brain, infection of the lungs or urine, abnormal heart rhythm (while you were under monitoring during hospitalization). You likely had a transient drop in blood pressure in combination with low blood sugar that made you feel dizzy after standing up and\/or coming out the restroom. While in the hospital, your blood pressure going from lying to sitting and then standing was normal. When changing positions, please take time and rest in between positions for few minutes to allow your body to accomodate the changes it is experiencing. Also, always receive help from another family member when you need to ambulate and change position for your safety. As discussed above, another contributing factor to your fall may have been a low blood sugar. It is recommended that you eat your breakfast soon after getting your morning insulin shot to prevent profound drop in your blood sugar. Due to concerns about your coughing and choking when swallowing, we asked the speech and swallow service evaluate you and obtained a video oropharyngeal swallow study. This showed silent aspirations to thin liquid and nectar thick consistency. Please do not eat thin liquids and nectar thick foods to avoid an aspiration event. Any food that is thicker in consistency than thin liquids minimizes the risk of aspiration. Please crush medications and mix with apple sauce; you can easily purchase a motar and pestle from a local pharmacy or online. For example, you can get a set for $5.49 on ___. If you cannot crush a medication, you can put the pill into apple sauce and swallow. You were found to have low platelet count in your blood. It seems to have been low, but stable for a while. As you did not show any obvious signs of bleeding during this hospitalization, we just watched the platelet count throughout the hospitalization and it has remained stable."}

The team contacted ___, and determined that her ASA had been discontinued 3 days prior to admission, after it was found her Hct was 25.2. During this admission, the decision was made to restart ASA 81 daily for anticoagulation. The team was considering starting Coumadin, but given her recent anemia, high fall risk, and since she was not on ASA for the 3 days prior to the stroke, the decision was made to restart the ASA 81 daily rather than Coumadin.

The tingling has been happening off and on for the last ___ years, but this time it is tingling for longer than usual. On exam, she has a mild UMN pattern weakness in the 4+ range in both her arm and her leg. There are no sensory changes on formal testing with pin. Given her stroke risk factors (ie having afib but only being on ASA given her bleeding risk in the setting of bilateral SDH), she had an MRI of her brain looking for a stroke that could have led to her right sided weakness. There was no change on her MRI from her prior MRI in ___. Chronic small bilateral occipital lobe infarcts were noted and similar to that seen in ___ ___s chronic small vessel changes. She also had an MRI of her cervical spine, which did not show any abnormal cord signal intensity. She has some degenerative changes resulting in multilevel neural foraminal narrowing worse at R C3-C4. Overall, it is unclear what caused her right sided weakness and neuropathy. Given that the weakness has been going on for the last week to 4 weeks, it may have been that she had a small left sided stroke resulting in a mild right hemiparesis. This would not be picked up on DWI\/ADC if it happened >14 days ago, so perhaps that could be one explanation. Regardless, she is not someone who could be safely anticoagulated given her age and risk of falling in the setting of a history of bilateral subdural hemorrhages.

{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: ___ year old male with diabetes, chronic kidney disease, atrial fibrillation on warfarin presents with acute on chronic renal failure and associated electrolyte and metabolic abnormalities, admitted to the ICU for further management. ACTIVE ISSUES ------------- # Shock: Developed during early part of hospitalization. Etiologies considered were cardiogenic, septic, and neurogenic. Most likely etiology septic based on improvement with broad spectrum antibiotics. Required three pressors (norepinephrine, phenylepherine, and vasopressin) for maintenance of MAPs>60mmHg. These were down-titrated as tolerated. The patient was also fluid resuscitated with boluses of NS. He was empirically started on vancomycin, cefepime, and metronidazole, and eventually transitioned to meropenem secondary to persistence of leukocytosis and fevers. Antibiotics were discontinued on ___. Culture data was all negative. Echocardiogram revealed normal ventricular function. Patient continued to be afebrile and without leukocytosis throughout the remainder of his hospital course. # Respiratory failure: Patient was electively intubated for worsening metabolic abnormalities. Mechanical ventilation was weaned as tolerated and he was extubated on ___. Following extubation, the patient was weaned to room air, but later on in his hospital course, he developed a new oxygen requirement. Furosemide trial was attempted, and incentive spirometry was encouraged. Patient was satting at92% RA on day of discharge and no longer had a demand for oxygen. # Hyperkalemia: Likely elevated in the setting of renal failure. Had questionable peaked T-waves in the ED. He received treatment with D50, insulin, and albuterol at OSH with persistently elevated potassium. He also received kayexelate, calcium gluconate, D50, insulin in fluids in the ___ ED. Due to persistent metabolic abnormalities, he was started on CVVH. His potassium improved and normalized with return of his kidney function. # Acute on chronic kidney injury: Patient with elevated creatinine in the acute setting. FeNa of 1% which is equivocal for prerenal vs ATN. Nephrotoxic medications were avoided and his medications were renally dosed. He was started on CVVH as above and nephrology recommendations were followed. Ultimately, his kidney function improved and he did not require any renal replacement therapy. Cr at the time of discharge was 1.5. # Atrial fibrillation: CHADS score of 3. Required cardioversion several times secondary to hypotension and RVR with HR to the 160s. An amiodarone drip was initiated but aborted ___ after no improvement in heart rate. He was also refractory to diltiazem gtt and esmolol gtt. This likely was exacerbated by metabolic derangements, refractory shock, and atrial stretch from hypervolemia. He was digoxin loaded ___ and this was continued during his hospitalization. Amiodarone was restarted ___. As pressors were weaned off and blood pressure stabilized, metoprolol was intiated with improvement in his heart rate. Further, he was reinitiated on an amiodarone drip for loading for a total of ten grams. His anticoagulation originally was held secondary to supratherapeutic levels. It was not reinitiated at the time of call out from the MICU. Cardiology recommended call out to the cardiology service for further management. Once on the cardiology service, the patient continued to be in atrial fibrillation, with rates into 100-120s. Patient was initially maintained on digoxin and metoprolol, but was not well rate controlled. Diltiazem was added, but heart rates continued to be elevated. This lack of response to oral medications was thought to be due to malabsoption in the setting of large-volume diarrhea discussed below. As such, efforts were made to better control the diarrhea, and as his bowels slowed, heart rates became better controlled. Patient's warfarin was restarted on ___ when his INR came back down to 2.7. It was initiated at a dose of 2.5 mg. Patient's INR will need to be rechecked on ___. # Diarrhea: At baseline the patient has a protuberant abdomen. Clinically, there was a concern for intraabdominal process contributing to his refractory shock. His stool cultures, including C. diff PCR, were negative. He had a Flexiseal placed for rectal decompression. He continued to have diarrhea that was believed to be non-infectious and related to bowel loss of his normal gut flora. He was started on loperamide and tincture of opium while in the MICU. Once the floor, the patient was given cholestyramine in addition to loperamide with eventual improvement in his diarrhea. # Anemia: Patient with baseline hematocrit in ___. This has been downtrending since admission. Patient has had guaiac positive stools this admission, but no overt melena. Guaiac positive stools were not unexpected in the setting of large volume diarrhea. Iron studies were consistent with anemia of chronic disease. On ___, the patient was experiencing some bright blood mixed with stool, likely from active hemorrhoids. Hematocrit was stable between ___, and he was not orthostatic. He will need daily hematocrit checks and hemorrhoid care. # Citrate administration: Iatrogenic administration into systemic circulation. Discovered in the ___ of ___ with toxicology consulted for recommendations. Calcium was checked q2hrs for monitoring of hypocalcemia with calcium gluconate for repletion. Adverse side effects of citrate toxicity include hypocalcemia and QTc prolongation. Ionized Ca++ was monitored and was maintained >1 with calcium gluconate administration. Per toxicology, likely cleared from system over 24hrs. Never experienced QTc prolongation. # Metabolic acidosis: Likely secondary to renal failure and inability to clear hydrogen ions. Lactic acid normal. Patient received bicarbonate in the ED. Improved with management and resolution of shock. # Toxic metabolic encephalopathy: Following extubation the patient's mental status waxed and waned. This continued for a majority of his hospital stay. The cause was thought to be secondary to many of the metabolic derangements discussed above as well as disturbances in sleep\/wake cycles. As the ___ hospital course became more stable, his mental status improved as well. # Hyperphosphatemia: Elevated on admission likely in the setting of renal failure. Improved with CVVH and return of renal function. INACTIVE ISSUES --------------- # Diabetes mellitus: Blood glucose monitored and managed with insulin sliding scale. # Hypertension: Anti-hypertensives initially were held secondary to triple pressor requirement. They were restarted as tolerated. # Hyperlipidemia: On simvastatin TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: -------------------- - 7 mm right middle lobe lung nodule.

During your stay you required a number of different antibiotics to help eliminate a suspected infection. You were also found to be in an abnormal heart rhythm, called atrial fibrillation. Due to this abnormal heart rhythm and your infection, your blood pressures dropped and you needed special medications to help you maintain a good blood pressure. In order to help you breathe, you needed to be intubated and you also required a form of dialysis to help remove fluid from your lungs. After an extended stay in the ICU, you eventually were able to be taken off the ventilator and you blood pressure stabilized. You were transferred to the floor.

{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: The following issues were addressed during this admission: <br> # Recurrent pneumonia <br> CXR on admission was consistent with L lower lobe pneumonia. She was also endorsing cough productive of green or bloody sputum as well as dyspnea. Given her risk factors for hospital-acquired pneumonia and MDR organisms, she was started on: CefePIME 2 g IV Q12H, Vancomycin 1000 mg IV Q 12H, Levofloxacin 500 mg PO\/NG Q24H. She was also started on Tamiflu, which was discontinued when influenza DFA came back negative. Blood cultures and sputum cultures were also sent. Interventional pulmonology was consulted regarding the utility of stenting given her recurrent infections and possible bronchomalacia. She underwent a bronchoscopy showing 98-100% collapse of her L mainstem bronchus. BAL and suction of LLL was performed and cultures were sent. No growth has been seen on blood or BAL cultures to date, and sputum culture grew only commensal organisms. The patient has been scheduled for rigid bronchoscopy with placement of a silicone Y-stent as an outpatient on ___. PFTs and a 6-min walk test were performed as a baseline for post-procedure comparison. She will follow up ___ weeks following stent placement to reassess pulmonary function and determine whether she is a candidate for permanent repair via tracheobronchoplasty with mesh placement. At discharge she was afebrile with no complaint of dyspnea and infrequent cough occasionally productive of yellow sputum. A PICC line was place prior to discharge for continuation of a 10 day course of Vancomycin and Cefepime as an outpatient. ___ follow up was arranged. . # Asthma: She was continued on her home asthma medications including albuterol, singulair, and advair. She was also given albuterol, ipratropium, and mucomyst nebulizers for symptomatic relief of her asthma. . # Anemia: No previous history of anemia per patient. Crits were stable this admission at around 35. Iron studies were sent and were all within normal limits. Reticulocyte count came back at 1.6 indicating some degree of marrow suppression. IV Ig products are known to induce hemolytic anemia, however her haptoglobin and LDH levels were also within normal limits. Her smear was abnormal with 2+ hypochromia, 2+ anisocytosis, 1+ poikilocytosis, 1+ macrocytosis, occasional microcytosis, occasional polychromasia, 1+ schistocytes, 1+ burr cells. As she has been taking many antibiotics over the past three months, several of which are known to cause anemia, and as it is possible she has had recent respiratory viral infections that could have resulted in some degree of marrow suppression, suggest outpatient follow up to reassess her anemia when not acutely ill or taking antibiotics. . # Chest pain: During ___ placement the patient reported the sudden onset of a \"fluttering\" in her chest and feeling like her heart was racing. She also reported mild chest pain that was positional and worsened when she was sitting up. The PICC line was pulled back 1cm with resolution of symptoms. CXR was then performed that showed PICC line tip located in SVC. EKG at the time showed mild STD in lateral leads. The same symptoms recurred several hours later, and a repeat EKG at that time was normal. Cardiac enzymes were negative x2. She was monitored on telemetry overnight. She was asymptomatic for the rest of the admission. This episode was thought to be due either to a transient arrhythmia induced by advancement of the PICC into the right heart, or due to tachycardia secondary to anxiety and albuterol tx. . # Yeast Infection: On hospital day one she reported symptoms of vaginal pruritis and burning consistent with prior yeast infections. She was given a one-time dose of fluconazole with resolution of her symptoms by the following day. . # Urinary frequency: On hosp day one, she reported increased urinary frequency and voiding only small amounts of urine with each attempt.

{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: # Atrial flutter and A Fib with RVR: He has a history of atrial fibrillation but no previous documented episodes of atrial flutter. On admission he was taking 100mg metoprolol succinate BID for rate control. His HR was 130s, which broke with evening dose of metoprolol and was continued on 100mg metoprolol tartrate BID. Had previously taken amiodarone 200mg daily for rate control, but this was discontinued in ___ for unclear reason. He was given NS IV and monitored on telemetry. He was initially borderline hypotensive with SBP in 100s, but this abated with fluids. Had one episode of atrial flutter with rate in 120s on ___ that broke after 5mg IV metoprolol times three and 15 mg IV diltiazem. He ws continued on diltiazem 30mg PO Q6hrs following this episode, but had ___ second pauses and bradycardia to high ___ that night. Diltiazem was discontinued and doses of metoprolol were held intermittently for HR <60. For the 48hrs prior to discharge he was in both sinus rhythm and atrial fibrillation and rate remained mostly ___. Given the course, it appears that is rate is somewhat labile. Though further rate control may not be needed if her remains euvolemic, he may need to re-start amiodarone if he has further episodes of RVR. Pharmacy suggested that he does not need to take loading doses of amiodarone if it is re-started prior to 50 days from ___ and can begin 200mg daily. He will follow-up with his cardiologist, Dr. ___ want to consider ablation in the future. . # Blood Pressure Control: The patient was intially borderline hypotensive, had orthostatic blood pressure changes and was very dizzy. This was thought most likely secondary to dehyrdation in the setting of gastroenteritis and poor PO intake as well as medication effects and atrial flutter. His record documents history of autonomic neuropathy, but no further information was available. He had complained of dizziness ___ after his prior discharge and stopped taking some of his antihypertensives including lisinopril, amlodipine and isosorbide mononitrate with some improvement. Prior to this admission, he had re-started lisinopril. Furosemide was held on admission along with amlodipine 10mg, but lisinopril and isosorbide were continued. After volume repletion and rate control, his BP began to climb to SBP 120s-160s day of discharge. On discharge, his furosemide was re-started. If further control is needed, he may need to add back amlodipine. . # Abdominal pain: This pain was lower abdomen, dull and crampy, thought to be due to viral gastroenteritis and constipation. It was found to resolve with passing gas and bowel movements. The patient was continued on simethicone, acetaminophen, ondansetron, and bowel regimen for symptomatic management. He had several episodes of loose stools on hosptial day 2. Following this, he did not pass stool until the day prior to admission, and at that point his abdmoinal pain resolved. He reported having a colonoscopy last year at ___ that was normal. . # CKD: He has known CKD likely from underlying diabetic nephropathy and hypertension. His baseline creatinine appears to be 1.3-1.5, and he was 1.6 on admission with hyponatremia to 132 and realtive hyperkalemia of 5.2 With IV NS, the electrolyte derrangements resolved and his Cr trended down to 1.0. . # DM: Followed FSBS and gave insulin sliding scale with continued home standing 70\/30 25 units BID. His FSBS were typically ___. . # CAD: Has history of MI, wasn't taking isosorbide mononitrate. This was restarted, and he was continued on beta blocker and full dose ASA while inpatient. He was ruled out for MI with cardiac biomarkers. . # Hyperlipidemia: Lipids ___ LDL 97, HDL 37, Total 197, TGs 343. Not currently on statin as outpatient. Should be considered by outpatient providers.","summary":"You were admitted to the hospital with abdominal pain and dizziness. You likely had a gastrointestinal illness and became dehydrated. We gave you medicine to soften your stools and help you pass gas as well as fluids through the IV to help this. You have had several episodes of fast heart rate called \"atrial flutter\" while you were here. We continued you on the metoprolol that you normally take to keep your heart rate normal. We also gave you a medicine called diltiazem to slow your rate, but this slowed your heart rate more than necessary and it was stopped. We monitored your heart rate for the past two days and it was mostly normal. You will likely need to start taking amiodarone again to keep your heart rate slow."}

{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: Ms. ___ is a ___ woman who is nonverbal and quadriplegic at baseline secondary to two large prior strokes, h\/o HTN, epilepsy, COPD, and Sjogens (not on anti-inflammatory regimen) who was brought to the ED from her nursing home with abnormal labs, namely hypernatremia, hypokalemia, and leukocytosis, after a recent admission for pneumonia complicated by septic shock (___). #Hypernatremia\/hypokalemia: Patient presented with Na+ 153 and K+ 2.7. Most likely due to decreased tube feeds and possibly insensible losses with resolving PNA. Hypokalemia likely related to appropriate aldosterone release. Her TBW deficit on admission was 3.2L, which was corrected with free water flushes via G tube over 2 days. Hypokalemia improved with po supplementation, and she did not have EKG changes. #Leukocytosis: Patient also presented with leukocytosis with WBC 20K. This was felt to be due to resolving PNA with an element of hemoconcentration. After free water flushes, her WBC improved to 14 at discharge. CXR showed resolving PNA from prior CXR during admission for PNA (___). Urine cultures were negative, and blood cultures were pending at time of discharge. CDiff was sent due to loose stool on admission but was negative. #Atrial fibrillation: Hospital course was complicated by afib with RVR, which improved with increased home metoprolol po to 50 mg q6h and with IV metoprolol pushes during RVR episodes. Of note, patient has a high CHADS-VASC score, but per OMR during recent goals of care discussion, anticoagulation is not within family's goals of care and was felt to be too high risk in this patient with prior hemorrhagic stroke. #H\/o prior hemorrhagic CVAs: non-verbal, quadriplegic at baseline. Patient seen by wound team for recommendations (see worksheet for recommendation). ___: Patient's creatinine on admission was 1.4, which is higher than a baseline around 1 but improved from a discharge creatinine of 1.9 from last admission. Her new baseline is unclear currently, as she was thought to have possible ATN in setting of septic shock during prior admission. CHRONIC ISSUES: #CAD complicated by recent type 2 NSTEMI: started aspirin and statin this admission for secondary prevention #Epilepsy: continued home keppra. #COPD: continued home ipratropium nebs #HTN: held home amlodipine throughout admission and at discharge due to BPs around 140 and because metoprolol dose was increased. Amlodipine may be restarted if indicated. #H\/o constipation: continued home docusate, bisacodyl, milk of magnesia, polyethylene glycol #NSTEMI on prior admission: EKG this admission without ST changes. Continued metoprolol as above, and started aspirin 81 mg this admission as well. TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: - Please ensure adequate free water flushes, as hypovolemia is the most likely explanation for abnormal labs; we recommend 250ml H20 q4h - Check chem7 within 1 week of discharge - Home amlodipine discontinued during admission and on discharge given BPs in 140s - Home Lasix held throughout admission and at discharge given hypovolemia. However, would recommend this be restarted at rehab approximately 1 week after discharge if concern for volume overload and recommend follow up BMP accordingly.","summary":"You were seen at ___ due to abnormal labs that were seen at your rehabilitation facility. Specifically, you were found to have low potassium and high sodium. These were felt to be due to dehydration. We gave you some water flushes through your G tube and your sodium improved. We also gave you potassium supplementation, which helped your potassium levels. During your hospital stay, you had fast heart rates, which are related to your atrial fibrillation (a-fib). For this, we increased your metoprolol, which helped your heart rates improve. While you were here, we repeated your chest xray given your recent pneumonia; this was improving on the repeat xray."}

In the MICU he was afebrile, hypertensive to 161\/100, tachycardic to 114, and was somewhat tremulous and diaphoretic. He was placed on Diazepam 5 mg PO Q1H:PRN for CIWA > 14. He was otherwise comfortable and stable, no longer reported any chest pain, and was speaking in full sentences, and was alert and oriented to person, place, and date. He was restarted on his home metoprolol and diltiazem dose, and was started on B12, folic acid, and thiamine. The next morning the patient was requiring less diazepam (5mg q4H:PRN for CIWA>14) and was no longer tachycardic, hypertensive, tremulous or diaphoretic. He was therefore transferred to the floor. On the floor he was initially comfortable and stable, and his diazepam requirement decreased to 5mg q8H: PRN for CIWA>10. Social work was consulted given frequent admissions for alcohol abuse. However, on the morning of ___ he was dissatisfied with his lunch and became agitated. Despite receiving 2 doses of 5mg diazepam q2H, he continued to be agitated and abusive to nursing staff, and stated in no uncertain terms that he wanted to leave. The risks of leaving while undergoing treatment for alcohol withdrawal were explained to the patient, including seizures and death; however, he insisted on leaving and left the hospital against medical advice. . # Tachycardia (sinus): unresponsive to IV fluids in ED. Likely due to EtOH withdrawal. Patient was placed on telemetry; home metoprolol, diltiazem were continued; he received maintenance IV fluids at 100cc\/hr and Diazepam for EtOH withdrawal (as per above). . INACTIVE ISSUES # Hypokalemia: admission K 2.7, possibly due to long-standing alcoholism accompanied by vomiting and diarrhea, as well as this patient's use of HCTZ and furosemide. K was trended daily and repleted as necessary. . # Anemia, thrombocytopenia: Hct was stable in low 30___. Iron studies (___) had shown Iron 203, TIBC 239, Transferrin 184, ferritin 278, B12 407, folate 15.6. Plt 102, which is approximately at the patient's baseline. Both anemia and thrombocytopenia are likely due to alcohol-induced bone marrow suppression, though on this admission B12 was wnl (308). CBC was monitored; thiamine, folate were given daily. . #. Back pain: chronic for about ___ no surgical intervention per neurosurg (see last d\/c sum). Pain was controlled with lidocaine patches. . #. Hepatitis B\/C: alcoholic pattern. Has h\/o grade 3 fibrosis. Outpatient management was recommended. . #. Atrial fibrillation: not on coumadin due to risks with homelessness. Patient reports receiving prior cardioversion. ECG is sinus here. - Continue metoprolol and diltiazem TRANSITIONAL ISSUES None - patient left AMA.","summary":"You were admitted to the ___ for chest pain on ___.

She presented to her nephrologist for routine visit with no acute complaints, except for fatigue that has been ongoing. Her Cr was checked was elevated to 3.3. She was admitted for further evaluation. Calc FENA was 1.4 with UOSMS of 431 at admission, not particularly suggestive of pre-renal physiology. Renal US shows no hydronephrosis, or bladder retention. Pt was producing adequate amounts of urine. Sediment analysis reveled blood which was initially thought to be related partially to ___ supratherapeutic INR. The urine also had abnormal RBC morphology, no casts were seen. Lisinopril, hydralazine and sotalol were all stopped at admission due to poor renal function. She was given fluids with mild decrease in Creatine from 3.3->3.0 which she has stayed stable for the last few days. She has been producing adequate amounts of urine output.

The final renal biopsy shows 1+C3 along tubular basement membranes and in vessels. Tubular basement membranes show no IgG deposition. The amount of immune complex deposition noted is consistent with a pauci-immune process (here most likely hydralazine related), but does raise the possibility of a second, immune complex related process. Interestingly, hydralazine is also associated with drug induced lupus like syndrome. Other labs such ___ and ANTI-HISTONE ANTIBODY were also positive. . She was then started on prednisone 50mg PO daily and on cyclophosphamide 75mg daily on the day of discharge. She should continue these meds until she is further evaluated by nephrologist. She will need close follow-up and will need monitoring of her CBC, electrolytes and creatine.

He was given supplemental magnesium sulfate for low magnesium and transferred to ___ for further management. At ___, the patient's images and results from ___ were reviewed by the Neurology team and showed no abnormalities. Additionally, a CTA Head\/Neck was obtained. 3D reconstruction of his neck vessel imaging showed a ___ area suspicious of a left vertebral artery dissection with pseudoaneurysm, which was confirmed by fat-suppressed MRI imaging. His symptoms were likely due to a transient ischemic attack from that dissection. He improved clinically throughout the hospital course, but complained about intermittent headache. He was discharged on aspirine 325mg as an antiplatelet agent, and we instructed him to go to an emergency room should his symptoms with nausea and vertigo reoccur.

{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: In summary, this is an ___ year old man with a history of COPD, severe bullous emyphysema, known atrial fibrillation on warfarin, digoxin, verapamil and aspirin who presented with acute onset dyspnea consistent with a pneumothorax. . # PNEUMOTHORAX: This was found to be a spontaneous pneumothorax secondary to rupture of emphysematous bulla, similar to three prior ruptured bullae leading to pneumothorax in the left lung in the past. Pneumothorax was confirmed on chest CT at the outside hospital and reconfirmed at ___. Thoracic Surgery evaluated the patient and noted that surgical intervention was unnecessary at that time. The patient's pneumothorax remained stable on serial chest xrays and the patient's dyspnea improved with oxygen and management of his COPD\/emphysema. . # COPD \/ EMPHYSEMA: The patient was continued on his home regimen of inhaled fluticasone two times daily and albuterol-ipratropium nebulizers every six hours. For breakthrough dyspnea, an additional albuterol nebulizer could be administered every three hours as needed. The patient was weaned from 4L oxygen upon arrival to his home dose of 2L oxygen upon discharge. When admitted, the patient was on 30 mg prednisone daily that had been started to manage a COPD flare prior to this admission. This was tapered to 20 mg prednisone daily by discharge. The patient was given detailed instructions on how to continue the taper and this will be managed while he is an outpatient. Both saline and fluticasone nasal spray were administered to manage the patient's post nasal drip, with moderate effect. . # ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: Patient had known atrial fibrillation managed with digoxin, verapamil and warfarin and had reappearance of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response in the ___ ED. This was likely triggered by his acute pulmonary process -- the pneumothorax and possible COPD flare -- with possible contribution from missing doses of his digoxin and verapamil prior to admission. The patient's cardiac markers were negative x2 and his most recent TSH was within normal limits making hyperthyroidism an unlikely cause for atrial fibrillation. The patient was maintained on 480 mg\/day total of oral verapamil, but dosing changed from twice daily to three times daily dosing to maintain more constant systemic levels of drug. The patient's digoxin was decreased from 0.25 mg to 0.125 mg daily given a borderline elevated serum digoxin level. Telemetry showed that the patient remained in atrial fibrillation but was rate controlled between 85-100 BPM. The patient was found to be subtherapeutic on his initial warfarin dose of 1 mg (INR of 1.1 on admission) and his warfarin was increased to 5mg by discharge. His INRs will be monitored as an outpatient by his primary care physician. . # URINARY RETENTION: The patient has a benign prostatic hyperplasia and was maintained on his home regimen of tamsulosin (Flomax) and finasteride. He had a history of a Foley catheter in place for 2.5 weeks total, removed only 1 week PTA. He presented without a Foley catheter in place and had just completed a course of ciprofloxacin as prescribed by his urologist, but initial urinalysis showed positive nitrites, WBCs and many bacteria; however urine cultures did not grow out any predominant species. A Foley catheter was placed in the ___ ED for patient comfort as patient complained of urinary urgency, frequency, and straining. Because of concern for UTI, the patient underwent several Foley removal \/ voiding trials.

She was transferred to the ward on ___ from the ICU. . # Shock: Patient met SIRS criteria with temperature, leukocytosis and tachycardia. Likely source was unclear although this was most likely septic shock due to pneumonia despite equivocal CXR. She did have a moderately positive UA on admission with ___ WBC and moderate bacteria which latterl, but there was no growth on urine culture. Cardiogenic shock was possible given the elevated CE but unlikely to be associated with a fever to 104. CT-head and LP were unremarkable. The patient received Vancomycin and Ceftriaxone at the OSH. Her lactate rose to 3.1 on ___ and this decreased to 2.0 on ___. She had a central line and A-line inserted and her hemodynamics were closely monitored. She was treated with IV broad spectrum abx in the ICU with Vancomycin\/Cefepime\/Ciprofloxacin and later continued on cefepime and vancomycin.

{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: Mr. ___ is a ___ w\/ epilepsy (complex partial seizures) on 3 AED and history of traumatic SAH in ___ who presents with dyspnea on exertion found to have unprovoked bilateral PE. # Pulmonary emboli: He had unprovoked PEs and was hemodynamically stable, requiring 4L O2 on admission. No recent travel, immobilization, family history of thrombophilia, systemic signs or records of malignancy. He denied any recent seizures and falls since ___ where he would have been down for a prolonged period. Thrombolysis was not indicated. He was started on a heparin drip. TTE showed pulmonary hypertension without classic RV strain (did note some mild RV dilation and abnormal septal motion). He was judged not to be a good candidate for the newer oral anticoagulants given multiple AED drug interactions. Neurosurgery was not concerned about traumatic SAH 6 months ago. We transitioned him to a Lovenox bridge to coumadin (initiated on 6 mg given warfarin levels will be lowered by phenytoin and phenobarbital). We weaned him off O2 and at the time of discharge he had no subjective dypsnea at rest or with exertion, ambulatory O2 sats ranged 88-95%. He did not meet criteria for needing home O2. Given the high risk of recurrent PE after first unprovoked PE, we recommended that he would need indefinite anticoagulation. His recent fall was due to a seizure, so this will depend on future assessment of fall risk. # Seizure disorder: His phenobarbital level was within therapeutic range, but phenytoin was subtherapeutic - 1.8 and 1.6 on repeat. We did not adjust his dose as it had been increased recently in ___. Albumin level was normal. Free phenytoin was pending at discharge. We discussed the importance of adherence to AEDs - he reported that he only rarely misses a dose when he is out the house, discussed that having a small pillbox would be good. Transitional issues: =================== - O2 sats noted to decrease at night - consider outpatient sleep study -Patient is being bridged with lovenox until therapeutic on coumadin, please check INR on ___ to see if can stop lovenox bridge -Patient had low levels of phenytoin in hospital. After discussion with pharmacy this was not adjusted given the new potential affects of coumadin. He had a free phenytoin level that was pending on discharge. He should follow up as an outpatient to determine if these levels needs adjustment.","summary":"You came in with shortness of breath and we found that you had blood clots in both lungs.

Recently she has had similar symptoms this time associated with hematemesis. The patient has had 3 such admissions in the past month. Based upon EGD on ___, this most likely is due to atrophic gastritis with a possible ___ tear, focal esophagitis or less likely esophageal cancer as the cause of the bleeding. The patient should continue pantoprazole and sucralfate and should have a repeat endoscopy in approximately 2 months for re-evaluation and esophageal lesion biopsy (was not biopsied yet because of active bleeding). With scheduled zofran Q8 hours (and additional compazine PR PRN for breakthrough nausea) she had good control of the nausea and vomiting symptoms. She should continue on standing zofran. She should avoid all aspirin containing products and non-steroidal anti-inflammatories as these are a trigger for her symptoms. For now the patient should continue on a clear and full liquid diet without solids. Use of ensure supplements will help with caloric intake.

She did much better when her sons were available at her bedside - taking pills, eating small meals and generally acting calmer. Her sons were able to come twice daily to the hospital and these made managing her meals and pills much easier.","summary":"You were admitted because of nausea, vomiting and blood in the vomit. It is most likely that the nausea and vomiting is due to atrophic gastritis (inflammation of the stomach lining). You also have signs of either a small tear in the esophagus or an area of injury that may be contributing to the nausea and vomiting and is probably the cause of the blood in the vomit. Please continue to take pantoprazole (to reduce stomach acid), sucralfate (to line the stomach and protect it from acid) and ondansetron (to treat nausea). There are additional medications that you can take as needed for persistent nausea. You should have another endoscopy in 2 months to further evaluate the stomach and esophagus and to allow for biopsy of the area of injury in the esophagus. Biopsy is essential to know what this area is and to make sure there is not underlying cancer. Avoid all aspirin containing products and non-steroidal anti-inflammatories as these can worsen your symptoms. For now please stick to a full liquid diet."}

While she has not suffered severe nausea and vomiting since the pyloric Botox injection in ___, her abrupt change in diet (fatty meal after a period of \"light fasting\") may have contributed to the present episode. KUB demonstrated normal bowel gas pattern which was reassuring that she did not have ileus or obstruction leading to nausea and vomiting. She was initially made NPO and then advanced to sips. She had several episodes of nonbloody, nonbilious emesis. After administration of metoclopromide and toradal, she felt her symptoms were improved and diet was advanced to full liquids in the AM. This was well tolerated and she was advanced to regular diabetic diet. She has continued to take her home domperidone during this admission. She was discharged on her home regimen.

{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: Ms. ___ is a ___ year old female with a history of mild asthma and eczema, SI, panic, depression, and recent admission for elevated LFTs and cholestasis in the setting of DRESS who presented with recurrent itchy rash. # Itchy Rash: The patient was initially admitted due to concern that the rash could be a recurrence of her DRESS. However, this was not the case as her eosinophil count remained low and her LFTs continued to improve. The medical team and dermatology consultant initially felt the rash was consistent with a drug-induced rash and their highest suspicion for a causative agent was ursodiol. Nonetheless, omeprazole and keppra have also been known to cause rashes. However, on further examination, dermatology felt the rash was more consistent with her underlying eczema and possibile miliaria and her itching related to dry skin and recent bilirubin elevation. They recommended several medications which were started in the hospital. Hepatology was also consulted and was fine with stopping ursodiol and the anti-pruitic regimen recommended by dermatology (fexofenadine, hydroxyzine, petrolatum, and topical steroids). Neurology was also consulted due to initial concern that the rash could be caused by keppra, however, they had a low suspicion that this was the causative agent. # Cholestatic liver failure \/ DRESS: LFTs, Tbili, and synthetic function were monitored and noted to further improve from prior discharge. She was continued on prednisone with plan for slow taper as an outpatient. She will need to be seen by gastroenterology.

She did not receive any blood transfusions. She did have one episode of rectal bleeding following an enema that was felt to be traumatic. This issue will require additional follow-up as an outpatient. # ?Seizure disorder: The patient has no clear history of seizures, only an unrelated syncopal event earlier in the month for which she was seen at an outside hospital, and myclonus in the setting of hepatic encephalopathy during her last hospitalization. Neurology was consulted and they recommended a routine EEG. Based on the lack of seizure activity, they were comfortable with stopping keppra and recommended further outpatient follow-up. # Depression and anxiety: The patient was continued on fluoxetine and seroquel. # Constipation: The patient was placed on a bowel regimen with resolution of her symptoms.","summary":"You were sent to the hospital out of concern that your DRESS had returned.

It was also noted on her CT abd\/pelvis that the patient had a new T12 compression fracture, stable autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, stable rt renal calculi with mild hydronephrosis, and stable sub-4-mm bibasilar noncalcified lung nodules which probably do not require followup as there is low clinical suspicion. We have held her aspirin 81mg and norvasc 5mg until her HCT are rechecked in a few days as an outpatient. If they are normal, she can resume these medicines. Moreover, the question of ischemic esophagus led us to hold the norvasc. . # ARF: Pt has CKD probably secondary to known ADPCKD, baseline Cr 1.3.

After his ICU admission he was transferred to the floor in stable condition although his creatinine continued to rise. After that improved with no intervention other than diuresis, he was discharged in stable condition to a shelter for help with his polysubstance dependency issues. . # Altered mental status: Most likely secondary to an ingestion. Patient later admitted to heroin ingestion. Percocet and Oxycontin bottles found in his room. Urine tox positive for opiates (on a screen that does not detect oxycodone) and cocaine. Other possibilities would be sepsis, post-ictal phase, toxic\/metabolic encephalopathy, hepatic or renal encephalopathy. Toxicology was consulted and thought this could be due to tylenol overdose or cocaine in setting of elvated LFTs, although OSH tylenol was negative. Patient started on ___ protocol and completed with resolution of LFTs. Patient mental status cleared by the time patient was tranferred to the floor. Patient states his only ingestion leading up to admission was his home vicodin, heroin (inhaled) and clonipin. Patient MS continued to improve but in setting of worsening renal failure, patient carefully monitered for uremic encephalopathy. On the floor the patients mental status returned to normal, labs improved and the patient was discharged with a normal mental status. . # Hypotension\/hypothermia: Differential originally included drug overdose, hypovolemia and overwhelming infection. Patient had no source of infection as CXR and lung exam clear, UA negative, no abdominal pain therefore antbiotics were withheld. Per toxicology, differential of ingestion in setting of initial bradycardia includes calcium channel blockers, beta blockers and digoxin. Patient had no change in blood sugars and his digoxin level was negative. Patient was continued on IVF wide open, especially in setting of rhabdo. Patient was eventually weaned from pressors that were started in the MICU. Once patient had stable BP for 24hrs, patient was transferred to the floor. Patient continued to have stable blood pressures for the rest of his admission. . # Transaminitis: Most likely due such as Tylenol vs shock liver. Started on N-Acetylcysteine in ED, received full course. Believe that LFTs could have been elevated with acute tylenol overdose but hypoperfusion is more likely especially as patient has signs of hypoperfusion with his kidneys with evidence of ATN. LFTs continue to downtrend. INR continues to downtrend as well. At time of discharge his LFTs had normalized, his INR was baseline and he did not require further checks of his LFTs. . # Rhabdomyolysis: Appears to be localized primarily to his lower extremities. Could be cocaine, an exercise supplement, or prolonged period down. Patient started on aggressive fluid resuscitation for his first few days in the MICU. Patient continued to have downtrending CK with eventual DC of fluids especially in the setting of worsening renal failure. . # Acute renal failure: Likely a combination of hypovolemia (hypoperfusion) and rhabdomyolysis. Patient aggressively fluid resuscitated as above, with down trending CK. Urinalysis showed evidence of muddy brown casts consistent with ATN, most likely due to hypoperfusion. Renal ultrasound was negative for any other acute process. Patient creatinine continued to trend up, as well as BUN. Patient was hypervolemic on examination and per renal given large dose lasix to try to improve kidney function. Patient was monitered for signs of uremic encephalopathy. Patient also had increasing anion gap most likely due to uremia. Patient was followed by nephrology and did not require any HD as he reached plateau and then began having downtrending creatinine which was siginificantly improved at the time of disposition. Urine output remained excellent . # Elevated lipase: Likely from hypotension, never c\/o abdominal pain. Lipase trended down with fluid resuscitation. . # Elevated troponin: Likely from overall hypoperfusion. EKG was reassuring. Enzymes were trended and came down without EKG changes. . # Depression\/substance abuse: Patient has hx of severe depression. It was unclear if patient had suicide attempt. Per family, patient's depression has been getting more severe and in turn his drug abuse more frequent. Social work was involved in patient's care early.

Additionally reinforced with patient the importance of engaging in the community and social functions to prevent isolation in her psychosis. Arranged for follow-up with patient's psychiatrys and therapist, in addition to arranging partial hospital program after discharge. Submitted ___ application on ___. Also spoke with husband about future consideration of guardianship, in light of patient's recent hospitalizations. -Alcohol abuse vs dependence: Per collateral, patient had been drinking one bottle of wine daily \"for the past few months\" prior to admission. She initially minimized her behavior, but as admission progressed, she attributed most of her interpersonal difficulties to her drinking. Believed that she \"just needed detox\" and \"everything would be okay.\" Patient did not show any signs\/symptoms of alcohol withdrawal during admission. Discussed with patient, in presence of husband, the importance for her to stay sober upon discharge. Patient agreed and articulated understanding #Medical: There were no acute medical issues addressed during this hospitalization. #Social\/Milieu: Patient was initially isolative in her room but became more visible as admission progressed. She attended few occupational therapy groups. Was not seen interacting with other patients. #Collateral: Dr. ___ ___ has seen this patient for about ___. States that Mrs. ___ has always presented as very calm, intelligent, and well put together during meetings. She is \"slow to open up to providers\" but over time, has revealed many concerning psychotic signs\/sx to Dr. ___. Mrs. ___ has a history of the following psychotic signs: 1)Paranoia (during episodes of decompensation, she accuses her husband of affairs and becomes very worried about his intentions), 2)Bizarre Behaviors (husband has reported that the pt will start howling and growling at home, while posturing - he has reportedly videotaped some of these events, 3) Hallucinations (pt has long reported persecutory auditory hallucinations), 4) Negative sx (at times she won't take care of ADLs and displays some pmr). She also commented on patient's increasing alcohol consumption (drinking appx 1 bottle of wine per night, although she continues to minimize this use). Much of the above tends to be triggered by the holidays of ___ when the patient travels with her husband to visit much family. This tends to amplify her sx and admissions have often been congruent with this time of year. The patient's family have had to come to ___ to assist her husband in caring for the patient. Reportedly, the mother and brother feel overwhelmed and have now chosen to disconnect from the pt because of her behaviors. Mrs. ___ took Risperdal ___ in the past. She did very well about ___ year ago, when she did not travel for ___ ___, supplemented regimen with po Risperdal, and did not require hospitalization . She was noncompliant, however, with Risperdal and chose to take Abilify. She was also noncompliant with this and had refused Maintena since stopping in ___. Husband characterized patient as always being somewhat rebellious and challenging of those in authority, and patient admitted to transferring some of her struggles with her father onto her husband following his death. Articulated awkwardness relationships currently as husband is in the position of monitoring patient's medication compliance and how this serves as an imbalance in their relationship. Husband stated that often times when he is not available or is traveling, patient will discontinue her medications. Patient has also been more sensitive to him being away and feeling insecure about what husband may be doing when he is not at home. Asked for referral to ___ for home based services. #Risk Assessment: Patient carries several risk factors for self-harm including several recent hospitalizations for psychotic decompensation ___ medication non-compliance, chronic and severe mental illness, alcohol abuse, social isolation, unemployment, marriage strain, worsening neurovegetative symptoms, lack of insight and transient suicidal ideation. However, she carries several protective factors including her established relationship with her psychiatrist, her supportive husband, lack of suicidal gestures in the past, desire to improve relationship with son and husband, and help seeking behavior, including willingness to accept Abilify Maintena injection and desire to connect with psychiatrist and therapist post-discharge. #Prognosis: Patient is at low or intermittent risk of self-harm insofar as she remains medication compliant and engaged in outpatient treatment, which includes regular socialization and activities outside of her home. However, if she devolves into her psychosis further due to non-compliance, she will likely require hospitalization. Discussed with patient's husband likelihood of pursuing guardianship in the future.","summary":"You were admitted for alcohol abuse, auditory hallucinations, and bizarre behavior as reported by your husband and psychiatrist. It was reported that ___ hadn't been taking your medications, which likely made your symptoms worse. We gave ___ an injection of Abilify, which ___ should continue to receive on a monthly basis, and we restarted ___ on oral Abilify."}
{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: This is a ___ year old right handed woman with a history of of Type II DM on low dose insulin, aortic stenosis, severe OA, ESRD on HD (q TuThSa), chronic SC vein thrombosis (secondary to lines) on coumadin, multiple HD line infections, who developed dysarthria and left sided weakness during dialysis on ___. ACTIVE ISSUES: # Altered Mental Status\/dysarthria and left sided weakness: The patient was taken to the Emergency department and a stroke code was called. Her work up was not concerning for an acute intracranial process. Her left sided weaknesses was resolved when seen on the floor, although she was still slurring her speech and confused compared to her baseline. The differential included a toxic\/metabolic vs infectious vs hypoperfusion of the brain. Given that this happened while she was on HD, and that this is reminiscent of her recent presentation and admission, it seems likely that hypoperfusion secondary to hypotension during dialysis is the likely cause of her altered mental status. She has known Aortic stenosis, calcifications found throughout her carotids on CT, and a known history of subclavian thrombosis. She is no longer taking clonidine for HTN and was still on her lisinopril. She takes lisinopril on HD days, and in the setting of her delicate blood pressures, this could have precipitated a transient cerebral ischemia in the watershed areas. Infection was also considered although she has not exhibited a fever or mounted a white count. Her LFTs are wnl. She also does not exhibit any signs or symptoms of an infectious process. She has a recent history of a yeast infection, however this is unlikely to cause global mental status changes unless she is fungemic. She could also have a toxic\/metabolic process, given that she had asterixis on exam. However her electrolytes were at her baseline. Neurologically, though there was no evidence of an obvious stroke on Head CT\/A she also could have had a TIA given report of focal neurodeficit. She has vessel disease (CAD, DM2, and carotid calcifications). An MRI would better characterize lesions, but she cannot get gadolidium due to her renal function. Per neuro recs: If patient has a return of more focal symptoms that do not resolve with improvement in her blood pressure, can consider MRI for infarct\/PRES, but no clear indication to do so now. . We held her blood pressure medication (lisinopril) and other sedating medications (gapapentin and clonazepam). The morning on ___, she was more lucid and at her baseline according to her primary care physician and her systolic blood pressures were in the 100s. . INACTIVE ISSUES: # Subclavian thrombosis-her INR trended from 1.6-->1.9->2.4. We continued home dose of warfarin at 3mg qd, and did not start IV Heparin. . # Right shoulder pain- likely due to degenerative disease and underlying renal osteodystrophy and osteoarthritis given her obese body habitus. She was given tylenol for pain control and we avoided NSAIDs given her history of H Pylori. . # CAD - She had no chest pain, and her EKG was congruent with her baseline. We continued home Simvastatin 40mg daily, Aspirin 81 mg daily and held her home Lisinopril given soft blood pressures. . # ESRD: on HD for the past ___ years, we continued HD (TuThSa) and her home medications: Sevelamer 3200 mg tid, Calcitriol 0.5 mcg daily, B complex-vitamin C- folic acid 1 mg daily . # GERD - asymptomatic on admission, but developed some acid reflux in the morning of ___. We continued her home Omeprazole 20mg qd . # DM II - last A1c 5.81 on ___, glucose today was 136. On 3 units NPH qhs. She has a healing right heel ulcer. She was on an ISS while in house with well controlled blood glucose and we placed a boot on her right heel. . # L breast edema - stable, had a workup as an outpatient with no evidence of breast cancer . TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: please follow up with the following - blood pressure medication titration - setting patient up with home blood pressure cuff - Left breast edema - right heel ulcer that is healing - blood culture results","summary":"You were admitted with altered mental status, slurred speech and weakness on your left side. We admitted you to observe your mental status. While you were at hemodialysis on the morning of ___, you were found to have slurred speech and your systolic blood pressure dropped. You were confused, had report of weakness on the left side of your body, and you were sent the ___ Emergency department. They thought that you might have had a stroke, but found that you didn't have evidence of this on a head CT, a strong Xray picture of your brain. You were sent to the medical team to watch monitor your mental status. Your electrolytes were normal for you and you did not seem to have an infection, thus we believe that this episode was caused by hypotension (low blood pressure) which delivered less blood to your brain and caused you to have your symptoms of confusion and slurred speech. Your left sided weakness had resolved by the time you came to the medicine floor. Your mental status improved with your blood pressure and by the time you left you were at your normal self. In recent times, it does not seem that you have hypertension (high blood pressure) and now it seems that you have hypotension(low blood pressure), so we recommend stopping your anti-hypertension medication (lisinopril) because that may be contributing to ___ hypotension(low blood pressure)."}

However, trop negx1, no EKG changes, and her chest wall and paravertebral cervical soft tissue were tender to palpation, which is most consistent with a non-cardiac musculoskeletal etiology of her pain. The patient was afebrile and had no leukocytosis, and had been on chronic antibiotics, making infection less likely. Her chest CT imaging from an OSH showed sequela of septic emboli from prior endocarditis that were actually improved on more recent imaging. TTE showed improving tricuspid valve function with a diminished size of the abnormality, reduced regurgitation, and density consistent with healing tissue. The patient reported her last IVDU was prior to her prior hospitalization. Urine and blood toxicology screens were negative. For pain control, the patient was given ibuprofen, acetaminophen and hydromorphone; at discharge these medications were continued, albeit at lower doses. She has PCP and ID ___. #Knee Pain: The pain is of unclear etiology, and began after her knee and ankle became acutely swollen >1month ago. At that time, she reports her joint was tapped (no information from OMR or patient). She denies trauma. There is medial joint line tenderness with full range of motion, and exam was suggestive of a medial meniscus tear or medial ligamentous injury. An MRI was performed on the left knee before discharge, and the patient will require further evaluation as an outpatient. Report pending at the time of discharge. # Vaginal Discharge: The patient complained of thick, white discharge and vaginal irritation consistent with vulvovaginal candidiasis during the hospitalization. Endogenous flora could have been compromised from prior antibiotic use. She denied dysuria, and a UA was negative for bacteria or inflammation. Irritation resolved after Fluconazole 200 mg was given once. # History of IV drug use: patient reports last use was prior to previous hospitalization, and toxicology screens were negative. She was seen by social work, who provided her with a list of resources to help her remain sober. # Nausea: The patient was nauseous before admission and on hospital day 2. She was given prochlorperazine, which improved her symptoms. # Insomnia: Trazodone 200 mg PRN was given for the patient's insomnia. INACTIVE ISSUES: ================ # Gastroesophageal Reflux: Per her home medication regimen, the patient was maintained on omeprazole 20 mg PO daily, and had no complaints of reflux during admission. # Anxiety\/Depression: The patient was continued on her home regimen of Effexor, Clonidine, gabapentin and Lamictal. # Tobacco Abuse: The patient was maintained on a nicotine patch. # Code: Full","summary":"You came to the hospital for chest discomfort and tightness on ___. You were admitted and your symptoms were managed with intravenous fluids, anti-nausea and pain medications. A chest radiograph and review of your previous CT scans determined that your previous lung injury from septic emboli (dislodged particles from your infected heart valve) were improving, and showed no signs of new disease. A transthoracic echocardiogram found that your tricuspid valve was healing after your recent heart infection (endocarditis), and there was no evidence of new infection."}
{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: ___ with HTN, dyslipidemia, SSS s\/p PPM, IBS who presents with hematemesis. # Upper GI Bleed: Hematemesis and melena most consistent with upper GI bleed. Furthermore, BUN was elevated, which is also consistent with an upper GI bleed. The patient was started on pantoprazole, with resolution of pain and hematemesis. She underwent an EGD which revealed a gastric ulcer in the greater curvature. Biopsies of the antrum were also sampled. H pylori samples were pending on discharge. The patient remained hemodynamically stable and never required any RBC transfusions. The patient will be discharged with pantoprazole BID. She will need a repeat EGD in 6 weeks. # Hypertension: The patient was continued on valsartan and clonidine. Metoprolol was held in the setting of GI bleed and was restarted at discharge. Consider down-titrating clonidine as patient's BP remained normotensive. # GERD: The patient will be discharged on protonix BID as above. # Hypothyroidism: The patient was continued on levothyroxine. TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: - Patient will be discharged on pantoprazole BID. - F\/u antrum biopsy pathology. - F\/u H. pylori serology. - Patient will need repeat EGD in 6 weeks. - Consider titrating off clonidine as patient remained normotensive during hospitalization.","summary":"As you recall, you were admitted because you were throwing up blood. You underwent an endoscopy (a camera to look at the contents of your stomach), and they found an ulcer, which was the cause of your bleeding. We started you on a new medication (pantoprazole), which will decrease the amount of acid in your stomach to help the ulcer heal. The GI doctors also recommend ___ have a repeat endoscopy in 6 weeks. Fortuantely, your blood counts remained stable and you never required any blood transfusions."}
{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: Patient was admitted to the hospital with pre-syncope. He was found to be orthostatic. He had had 1.5L of fluid taken off at outpatient dialysis. PO fluids were encouraged. Orthostasis resolved until after patient had dialysis here at ___ on ___. After dialysis on ___, his standing SBP was 84 compared to supine SBP of 118, but he was asymptomatic. Amlodipine was decreased from 10mg to 5mg daily, and he will take it in the afternoon (after dialysis) instead of in the mornings. Antihypertensive regimen may need to be further adjusted in the outpatient setting. He had a recent admission for pericardial effusion and tamponade requiring pericardiocentesis. His echo during this admission showed stable size of pericardial effusion (~1cm) and no evidence of tamponade physiology. Patient was restarted on home glipizide prior to discharge, but became hypoglycemic to 47. Therefore, glipizide dose was decreased by half (from 20 to 10mg QAM and from 10 to 5mg QPM) prior to discharge. He will need close follow up of his blood sugar and may need further adjustment of his diabetes regimen. Patient reported that he had felt suicidal prior to admission. He was evaluated by psychiatry, who felt that he was safe to be discharged home. He denied suicidality in the days prior to discharge. Depakote dose was increased from 500mg BID to ___ BID.","summary":"You were admitted to the hospital with lightheadedness. This was thought to be due to orthostatic hypotension, which means that your blood pressure was low when you stood up. In the future, please take amlodipine in the afternoon, not in the morning, especially on dialysis days. In addition, the dialysis center will have to be cautious about removing too much fluid. Make sure to get up slowly from sitting or lying down to decrease your chances of feeling lightheaded. While you do continue have a pericardial effusion (fluid around your heart), we do not think this was the cause of your symptoms."}
{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: ___ year old male with metastatic NSCLC presenting s\/p unwitnessed fall at rehab. He was recently discharged on ___ for an admission for nausea, vomiting and anion-gap metabolic acidosis. #FALL Mr. ___ fell off the side of his bed after reaching for the urinal. He recalls the entire event and denies any loss of consciousness. He was advised by nursing to call for help if he needed to use the urinal. He ignored this advice. The fall appears to be mechanical, however the patient reported right upper extremity weakness after the event. His weakness was difficult to assess initially due to pain in his right shoulder, grip strength was decreased to ___ on presentation. He sustained a minor amount of head trauma. CT scan in the ED revealed a small subgaleal hematoma, no intracranial hemorrhage and non-displaced left nasal and right lamina papyracea fractures. His most significant complaint after the fall was right shoulder pain. XR in the ED demonstrated no fracture or pathology of the ___ joint. He received IV morphine with good effect. He used a sling during the early part of his hospitalization. Pain control was provided with morphine ___ and morhpine IV PRN. After he was unable to swallow, he was placed on morphine oral concentrate 5q3h standing and ___ PRN. #RIGHT ARM WEAKNESS Mr. ___ presented with right arm weakness which was initially difficult to assess because of his right upper extremity pain after the fall. On the second day of his hospitalization his strength improved, however was clearly different from the left upper extremity. His right upper extremity strength remained at ___ and he later developed right lower extremity strength. A facial droop was noted by the pulmonary consult team, but was felt to be facial asymmetry with preserved function of all facial nerves and muscles by the medicine team. An MR head was obtain on ___ which showed no evidence of stroke and evere degenerative disease in the upper cervical spine, with significant compression and angulation of the spinal cord at the C3-4 level. This was thought to be the culprit lesion. Full C-spine MR imaging was not obtained as the patient was subsequent made CMO, therefore a compressive metastatic lesion could not be totally excluded. The patient responded well to dexamethasone 10mg IV x1 followed by 4mg IV Q6hrs. His extremity strength improved to ___. It remained unclear whether the fall and associated neck trauma precipitated further cord compression or if the weakness was present before the fall. Dexamethasone was discontinued when the patient became unable to swallow. #FACIAL FRACTURES Non-displaced left nasal and right lamina papyracea fractures. Case discussed with ENT; non-operative, antibiotics recommended. Patient was started on a 7 day course of amoxicillin, which was later discontinued with initiation of post-obstructive pneumonia treatment. #SHORTNESS OF BREATH Mr. ___ complained of shortness of breath since his discharge on ___. He was admitted on 24hr nasal cannula oxygen. He has a chronic cough which is unchanged. He denied sputum production, worsening chest pain, fevers and chills on presentation. His SOB is likely related to his primary lung cancer and large, malignant effusion on the left. The patient received a dose of levofloxacin in the ED, which was not continued on the floor. Chest CT noted focal RML ___ opacities suggestive of inflammation or early infection. He had no lower extremity swelling or other evidence of DVT. The patient developed low grade temperatures on his ___ and ___ hospital days; treatment for post-obstuctive HCAP was started with cefepime and vancomycin. His fevers resolved, however his shortness of breath did not significantly change. His PlearX catheter was drained as necessary. Output was quite poor compared to his previous admission, <250mL per 2 days. The patient was made CMO and his IV was not replaced. Cefepime and vancomycin were changed to levofloxacin, but this was discontinued when the patient became unable to swallow. He was on morphine oral concentrate as above for dyspnea as well. #METASTATIC NSCLC Patient presented with dyspnea, cough and community acquired pneumonia in ___. Imaging studies included CT chest on ___ which disclosed a consolidation of the lingula, bronchial narrowing, mediastinal lymphadenopathy, liver hypodense lesions and a large loculated left pleural effusion. A PET\/CT Scan from ___ disclosed the presence of an extensive FDG-avid consolidative process in the lingula, lymphangitic carcinomatosis, non-FDG avid pleural effusion, FDG-avid lymphadenopathy involving the bilateral supraclavicular regions, mediastinum, subcarinal stations, hilar portacaval and retroperiotenal nodes. FDG-avid liver lesions and FDG-avid osseous metastases. Pleural fluid removed on ___ disclosed a carcinoma. Immunohistochemical stains of the tumor cells were positive for CK5\/6, and CK7; and negative for CK20, p63, and TTF-1. This immunoprofile was nonspecific but compatible with a non-small-cell lung cancer not otherwise specified. Extensive discussions between family, patient and primary oncologist lead to the decision for no further cancer directed therapies, including palliative chemo, radiation or surgery. #AG METABOLIC ACIDOSIS Issue on previous admission, attributed to lactic acidosis from malignancy, and metformin. Metformin discontinued on previous admission. Lactate on ___ 6.6. Anion gap stable, no improvement with IVFs. #TYPE II DIABETES MELLITUS Metformin and glyburide discontinued during previous hospitalization due to reports of hypoglycemia and lactic acidosis. Insulin sliding scale continued during hospitalization in the setting of dexamethasone administration. Aspirin discontinued after CMO decision was made. #HYPERTENSION Blood pressures well controlled this admission. Diltiazem 15 mg PO\/NG QID continued until CMO decision was made. #PROLAPSED HEMORRHOIDS Stable issue. Outpatient follow up suggested during prior admission. Patient ordered for an aggressive bowel regimen. TRANSITIONAL ISSUES ******************* -PleurX catheter care, drainage PRN -Continue concentrated morphine solution for dyspnea and pain, may increase to 5mg q5min as needed -Continue inhaler for shortness of breath","summary":"You were admitted after a fall at your rehab facility and for management of you PlearX catheter. X-ray studies and laboratory tests showed progression of your non-small cell lung cancer. We discussed cancer treatment options with your oncologist and family and do not believe you would benefit from chemotherapy, radiation or additional chest tubes. During a family meeting we discussed end of life goals and collectively decided to focus on your comfort as there is no cure for your cancer. You will be discharged with plenty of morphine pills to take under your tongue for the pain."}
{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: ___ year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass graft, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, chronic kidney disease with baseline creatinine ___, heart failure with preserved EF now presenting with worsening dyspnea on exertion and right flank pain. ACTIVE ISSUES: #. Dyspnea on exertion: Possible etiologies include heart failure exacerbation, worsening renal failure causing volume overload, lung malignancy, underlying COPD, or pneumonia. Given patient's history and exam, including wet rales, elevated jugular venous pressure, and lower extremity edema, likely acute heart failure exacerbation in the setting of worsening renal failure. Pneumonia unlikely given no history of cough, sputum production, or fever, and no suggestive findings on CT. The patient's EKG showed no changes suggestive of ischemia and cardiac enzymes were negative. The patient was treated with furosemide and responded with diuresis with improvement in his dyspnea. His supplemental oxygen was discontinued and his respiratory rate and oxygen saturation remained normal throughout his course. . #. Right flank\/inguinal pain: Possible etiologies include nephrolithiasis, urinary tract infection\/pyelonephritis, musculoskeletal spasm, hip arthritis\/bursitis, or hernia. Early zoster outbreak was also considered as pain seems to be in a dermatomal distribution. CT scan was negative for stones, does show stranding on the right, but this appears stable from prior scans status post ruptured renal cyst. Urinalysis was negative for infection and patient had no other symptoms. Patient had no signs of hernia on exam. Because pain seems to be relieved with position (bed to couch), muscle spasm or hip bursitis most likely etiology at this point. The etiology of the patient's pain was never discovered, but his pain remained well-controlled on hydromorphone as needed, and he was discharged with three days' supply. . #. Acute on chronic renal failure: Patient with worsening chronic kidney disease over the last several months, creatinine on admission 5.3 from 4.1 one month prior to admission. CT scan showed bilateral renal atrophy and chronic changes from cyst rupture in ___. Acutely worsening renal function likely as a result of decompensated heart failure. The patient was followed by Renal while in-house; venomapping was performed so that an AV fistula could be placed in the near future if dialysis becomes necessary. Potassium restriction was added to the patient's diet and he was placed on a phosphate binder. He was also placed on 1.5 liter fluid restriction. The patient's creatinine improved with diuresis and was at 3.9 on the day of discharge. He will follow up with Nephrology upon discharge. . #. Lung nodules: Based on CT scan read, new nodules most likely malignant, and patient has 40 pack year smoking history. Nodules unlikely to be contributing to acute decompensation. This is likely contributing to reported appetite loss as well. CT-guided pleural biopsy was scheduled for outpatient workup. . #. Leukocytosis: Patient with WBC of approximately 20 throughout the course of his hospitalization. He was afebrile and is not on any immunosuppressions. There were no symptoms of infection, no signs of infection on exam. Urine culture was negative, with blood cultures pending. Chest x-ray did not show pneumonia, CT scan abdomen\/pelvis was negative, and patient had no spinous process tenderness concerning for osteomyelitis or abscess. There were no murmurs or other sequelae of endocarditis. There was no headache or neck stiffness so there was low concern for meningitis. Lung nodules may be atypical infection, however based on shape, size, more likely malignant. Vital signs were monitored and the patient remained afebrile thoughout his hospitalization. He had a single episode of vomiting but no other symptoms. Blood cultures are still pending at the time of discharge. . #. Hyperkalemia: The patient developed hyperkalemia to 5.9 in the setting of acute-on-chronic renal failure. He had no symptoms and EKG showed no changes from prior. He was started on Kayexalate, continued on furosemide, put on a potassium-restricted diet, and his losartan was discontinued. On the day of discharge, his potassium had normalized to 4.1 . #. Acute hematocrit drop: On Day 2 the patient's hematocrit dropped approximately 3 points. This was thought to be unlikely to be dilutional as he was not getting fluids. There were no symptoms of bleeding. Chronic anemia was likely secondary to his chronic kidney disease but is unlikely to account for his acute drop. There was no retroperitoneal bleed seen on admission CT. Hematocrit was trended and remained stable throughout the course of his admission, and the etiology for his acute drop was never discovered. INACTIVE ISSUES: #. Diabetes: Continued patient's insulin regimen. . #. Hyperlipidemia: Continued statin. . #. Atrial fibrillation: Continued metoprolol, amiodarone. Patient off coumadin since renal hemorrhage. Patient reports he does not take aspirin per his PCP's recommendations following his renal hemorrhage. . #. Hypertension: Continue metoprolol\/losartan\/isosorbide. Per attending's recommendations, isosorbide mononitrate dosing should be changed on an outpatient basis to daily instead of twice daily so the patient does not build up tolerance to the drug. . #. Hypothyroid: Continued levothyroxine. . #. Gout: Allopurinol was held given renal failure.

Initial exam was notable for left ptosis, mild left nasolabial fold flattening, left homonymous hemianopia vs. superior quadrantanopsia (inconsistent exam), and extinction to visual double simultaneous stimulation on the left. There were several potential differential etiolgoies for the hemorrhage including hypertensive, amyloid angiopathy, malignancy with hemorrhage, and ischemic stroke with hemorrhagic conversion. The most probable etiology for Mr. ___ was believed to be amyloid angiopathy given evidence of hemosiderine depositions on GRE MRI in ___. His aspirin is most likely going to be indefinitely held given his amyloid angiopathy. Upon admission, Mr. ___ home aspirin and heparin were held, while he was continued on home simvastatin, Metoprol, Keppra, and Lamictal. MRI head with and without contrast re-demonstrated a heterogeneous intraparenchymal hematoma in the right temporal and right parietal lobes measuring approximately 40 x 46 mm in transverse dimension, causing mild mass effect and effacement of the sulci and right occipital ventricular horn. For several days he had a fever of unknown etiology. However, blood cultures, chest X ray, and urine analysis showed no signs of infection.

{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: ___ year old woman w history of COPD, tracheobronchial malacia, thoracic aorta aneuryism s\/p graft, and chronic hypercarbemia with multiple recent admissions for high CO2, now presents with acutely low O2 saturation with some symptomatic confusion, resolved by the time of arrival to the MICU. ACTIVE ISSUES # Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Upon arrival to floor with BIPAP at FiO2 30%, she was satting 100% and comfortable, alert, awake, without complaints. She was subsequently weaned to 2 to 3LPM NC during the day and BiPAP ___ at night. However at one point during the daytime, while on 4L NC, she became more somnolent with paCO2 of 116. She again improved with BiPAP. Overall her chronic hypercarbia (secondary to severe COPD with likely component related to airways compression from aneurysm) was challenging to carefully manage. Her FiO2 was kept as low as possible and ETCO2 was measured intermittently, as has been done at her rehab facility. She was placed on BiPAP during the day when becoming more somnolent or with napping, and this kept her free of very marked rises in CO2. It does not seem likely that she can go for a whole day without BiPAP, and this pattern was confirmed with rehab pre-admission. It is hopeful that her chronic respiratory failure will improve with stenting by IP in the near future, though this remains uncertain. For PAP she was also trialed on AVAPS at night, with mean inspiratory pressures around 18, which could be considered at rehab as well. Regarding the stent placement, Interventional Pulmonology was consulted and recommended clearance from vascular surgery (see below), pulmonary hypertension service, anesthesia (as an outpatient), cardiology (to rule out HOCM) and interval follow-up with IP before the procedure. An ECHO was performed which showed LV outflow obstruction not increased by Valsalva, which was not consistent with a diagnosis of HOCM. Cardiology recommended maintaining euvolemia and avoiding any diuretics. The pulmonary hypertension service was consulted and cleared her for rigid bronchoscopy, no need for specific PAH therapy at this time, to avoid CCBs (as this may exacerbate her VQ mismatch) and regular ABGs from an arterial line during the stenting procedure. She is set to have the custom Y-stent placed in a few weeks by IP pending clearance and follow-up. # Abrnormal EKG She was noted to have peaked T waves on telemetry on routine monitoring. She was asymptomatic (no chest pain, palpitations, acute respiratory compromise). EKG was performed which showed peaked T waves, most pronounced in V2-3, with corresponding high voltage in these leads. There was no evidence of ischemia and these changes were unchanged from several prior studies. # Thoracic aortic aneurysm s\/p rupture with graft Vascular surgery was consulted regarding clearance for surgery (upcoming stent placement) and possible revision of the graft to improve her respiratory status. She deemed stable for surgery from this standpoint with no vascular surgery intervention required at this time. # Hypertension Norvasc held on admission given reported history of allergy despite listed on her home medication list. Continue to hold given the potential for amlodipine causing a worsening of her respiratory status due to V\/Q mismatch exacerbation with amlodipine causing pulmonary vasodilation. Systolic blood pressures occasionally spiked to 170s during admission on metoprolol and hydralazine so her hydralazine was increased from BID to TID with good control. CHRONIC ISSUES # Hypothyroidism: Continued on home levothyroxine. TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: - Would ensure euvolemic volume status leading up to stent placement; discharge weight is 54.2 kg - Given patient's severity of COPD and pulmonary hypertension, please avoid calcium channel blockers as it may worsen V\/Q mismatch in her lungs. Her amlodipine was stopped for this reason. - Patient should adhere as much as possible to her nebulizer and inhaler treatment to optimize her COPD. - She was discharged on BiPAP with settings of ___ cmH2O. While she was here, she was trialed with AVAPS on a Triology device. Her average inspiratory pressure was 18 cmH2O. Please consider increasing her BiPAP settings if she has inadequate ventilation. - She was hypertensive this admission, and her hydralazine dose was increased to 50mg TID. - She will have follow up with Interventional Pulmonology, Dr. ___, 1 week prior to the stent placement. Dr. ___ ___ will contact her for follow up. - She was need a repeat CTA and follow up with Vascular Surgery in 3 months regarding her thoracic aneurysm. - She will need anesthesia clearance prior to procedure. - Her diet was changed to pureed solids\/thin liquids for comfort given report of dysphagia, likely secondary to compression of her esophagus by the thoracic aneurysm. She will need ongoing evaluation after treatment of her tracheal compression.","summary":"You were admitted for respiratory distress due to tracheobronchomalacia and collapse of your airways.

Since the patient stopped coumadin approximately 3 weeks prior to admission after completing a 6 month course of anti-coagulation for a previous PE, she is likely to need lifelong anti-coagulation. It is recommended that the patient stay on lifelong Lovenox, as studies have shown this medication is a more efficacious anti-coagulant in cancer patients than coumadin. Since the patient's insurance company will not pay for this treatment, we are forced to start coumadin in this patient. During her hospital course, she was maintained on a heparin drip and transitioned to coumadin successfully. She will follow up in the ___ clinic this week for further management.

Given patient failed 2 attempts at IUD placement due to spontaneous expulsion, patient was started on oral medroxyprogesterone for systemic therapy. Endometrial biopsy was performed that did not show evidence of malignancy. Patient was referred for uterine artery embolization per ___. Unfortunately, urterine arteries were too small, and embolization procedure was unsuccessful. She was initiated on progesterone and had resolution of her bleeding. See management of anticoagulation and antiplatelet as below. Will f\/u with GYN as outpatient, next appointment ___. #CAD\/Recent DES to LAD ___: Patient recently admitted for NSTEMI in ___ and is s\/p DES to LAD. She was discharged on triple therapy (ASA, Plavix, and Coumadin) for 1 mo, with plan then transition to Plavix\/Coumadin (no ASA) for at least 3mo. Patient did not develop new chest pain or L axillary pain (anginal equivalent). EKG upon arrival did not show evidence of new ischemia. She did show a mild troponin elevation, which downtrended, likely due to CKD with possible demand ischemia due to severe anemia. Given her anemia, warfarin was held, and patient continued on ASA, Plavix. Once bleeding stabilized her Coumadin was restarted. Once she reached therapeutic INR on warfarin her aspirin was discontinued to reduce her risk of bleed. She will continue on Plavix and Coumadin as outpatient. She required higher doses of Coumadin than previous home doses to get INR back in range. Will be d\/c'd on Coumadin 15mg daily. Please keep a close eye on her INR, especially in the week after arriving home, and dose adjust as necessary w\/ goal INR ___. Patient is high bleeding risk as highlighted in problem above. #ESRD on PD: Reported weight gain following missed PD. Renal was consulted for adjustment of PD ordered as needed to remove fluid. Continued calcitriol, calcium acetate, sevelamer.

Patient noted to be very sensitive to fluid shifts. Patient denied SOB. Volume status was managed with PD per renal and she was started on torsemide 100 mg daily. Continued on home metoprolol. #Fall: Patient fell while trying to sit on the toilet in the bathroom when in radiology dept for pelvic ultrasound. She reported headstrike but no LOC. Likely mechanical fall due to vision loss. Following the fall, patient had multiple musculoskeletal complaints including L ankle\/knee pain, right chest wall pain, HA. She had multiple studies including X-rays of L foot\/ankle, L knee, L wrist and rib films that all showed no acute fracture. CT head was negative for acute intracranial bleed, but did show evidence of intra-ocular hemorrhage. Per discussion with ophthalmology and comparison to Mass Eye and Ear records, this is a known\/expected post-procedural finding. Additionally, bilateral LENIs showed no DVT but did show a 2.8 cm mixed cystic and solid mass in the region of the left popliteal fossa, not seen on prior exam from ___. Pain was controlled with tylenol, oxycodone, lidocaine patches. #DMII: On U500, lantus, humalog sliding scale per previous hospitalization. Follows with ___.

{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: ___ yo M w\/ PMH of Hepatitis B and alcohol use with newly diagnosed cirrhosis presents from clinic with concern about recent worsening renal function and symptomatic ascites who was stable. Cirrhosis: patient has cirrhosis with no history of liver biopsy. He is being considered for placement on the transplant list and has initiated the steps to completing what is necessary for the evaluation. On arrival to the floor, his MELD score=16. He had signficant ascites on exam, with 3+pitting edema extending from his feet up over his abdomen. He is not on diuretics currently (they were withdrawn 3 weeks ago for refractory to this) We attempted to perform a therapeutic paracentesis at the bedside however, we were unable to get adequate access either due to kinking of the catheter with all of the subcutaneous edema or due to accessing a pocket that was not connecting to the rest. His diagnositic paracentisis showed no evidence of SBP but had a low total protein so he was started on cipro 250 for SBP prophylaxis. The access site continued to leak overnight after the procedure and a stitch was placed. This will need to be removed in ___ days. The patient was instructed on how to care for it. He will need to discuss with Dr. ___ or not a therapeutic tap on an outpatient basis is warranted. Hepatitis B- given the high viral load that the patient had, he was started on tenofavir at the time of discharge. Renal function- patient had elevated creatinine weeks prior to admission, which had been downtrending since then and was WNL at the time of admission. His urine lytes showed almost no urine pointing towards a prerenal picture, and his UA was negative with Urine culture still pending at the time of discharge. The elevated creatinine at the beginning of ___ was most likely due to his diuresis regimen at the time as it has since resolved. This is will need to be continued to be monitored as an outpatient. Transitional Issues: We started the following medications: -Tenofovir 300mg by mouth once daily (for hepatitis B) -Ciprofloxacin 250mg by mouth once daily (for prevention of abdominal fluid infection.) Please call Dr. ___ office on ___ at ___ to make an appointment for this week.","summary":"You were admitted to the hospital for increased abdominal fluid and worsening kidney function as an outpatient. Your blood work in the hospital showed that your kidney function has actually improved and is stable. We did a paracentesis (fluid tap of your abdomen) which showed no signs of infection.

{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: ___ man with morbid obesity, DM, HTN, and asthma admitted with dyspnea in the setting of volume overload and possible allergic reaction. . # Dyspnea: Likely multifactorial in setting of volume overload and asthma exacerbation, however acute diastolic heart failure was major contributing factor. Although he was given ampicillin and has a history of penicillin allergy, it is very unlikely this contributed to his shortness of breath given that he had not had ampicillin for over a week prior to presentation. He appeared significantly volume overloaded on admission with vascular engorgement on CXR consistent with CHF and JVP of 11-12cm therefore diuresis was initiated with TID IV lasix. He had excellent urine output, diuresing greater than 8L per day for several days. A TTE was unable to be performed due to body habitus, therefore EF is unknown, but patient likely has acute on chronic diastolic heart failure. He was discharged on 80mg oral lasix. Of note he had previously been on lasix and self-discontinued because of what he believed to be excessive urination. Patient was re-educated on symtpoms and management of heart failure and agreed to reinitiate this medication. His dyspnea had improved at the time of discharge and he was satting well on room air. Patient will hopefully have continued diuresis with net fluid losses over the next several weeks as an outpatient. . # CAD: Patient ruled in for NSTEMI with positive cardiac enzymes in the setting of heart failure. Patient denied chest pain or discomfort. Although heparin was started in ED, he was insistent that it be stopped. Patient not a candidate for cardiac catheterization at this time due to morbid obesity therefore he was medically managed with aspirin, plavix, beta blocker and statin. His risk factors need to be aggressively modified including blood sugar control, blood pressure control, as well as increased physical activity and weight loss, if possible. . # HTN: Sub-optimal control throughout entire admission although slight improvement with uptitration of medications. He was continued labetalol which was increased to maximum dose of 800mg BID. He was continued on maximal doses of norvasc and HCTZ. Lisinopril was increased to 60mg daily . # UTI: Urinalysis consistent with infection, culture unfortunately not performed. He was started on bactrim (day 1 = ___ and should complete a 14 day course . # ? Drug reaction: Patient likely had allergic reaction to ampicillin however exposure was greater than 1 week prior to admission and rash was resolving at time of admission. Patient was given solumedrol in ED given history of penicillin allergy, but not continued on steroids wduring admission. . # ARF: Unclear if CKD or ARF given baseline creatinine unknown. He has multiple risk factors for chronic kidney disease including diabetes and hypertension.

{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: This ___ year old ___ speaking female was admitted on ___ for difficulty in speech and discharged on ___. 1. Home medication overdose, which led to bradycardia, relative hypotension, and dysarthria. As mentioned in HPI, patient received 0.5 mg atropine and calcium carbonate and responded with transient improvement of her bradycardia. Her home medication Cartia XT and lisinopril were held. It is unclear if the extra small pills that she took were lisinopril or aspirin, but it was certain that she took extra Cartia XT. She was also supported with IVF. Her HR, BP, and dysarthria gradually improved during the remainder of her hospital stay. Her serial neurological exam was without focal findings. Her blood sugar was monitored closely as overdose of calcium channel blocker can lead to inhibition of insulin release (hyperglycemia after OD is a poor prognostic indicator). Her blood sugar remained below 200. Her vital signs remained stable, and patient was discharged with instruction to restart her lisinopril and Cartia XT on the day after discharge. Home services were arranged to assist patient in medication arrangement as well as physical therapy. This should be followed up by her primary care physician. 2. Acute vs. chronic kidney disease. Crt was found to be elevated at 1.6 as compared to 1.2 in ___. Unclear if this is chronic or acute given her length of stay since there is no data point between ___ and ___. However, she did receive IV fluid (NS) for presumed pre-renal state as a result of the hypoperfusion state secondary to Cartia XT and possible lisinopril OD. This can be further evaluated by patient's primary care doctor. 3. Thyroid goiter. This is an incidental finding on chest X-ray. Patient has no known history of goiter, but this likely has been present for some time. Given the likely chronic nature of the goiter, this can be further evaluated by patient's primary physician in the outpatient setting. 4. Hyperkalemia, likely secondary to overdose of home medication and poor forward flow. This resolved with treatment (D50, 10 units of regular insulin, 30 g of Kayexelate, 2L IVF) from the emergency department and holding of her home medications. EKG did not show changes typical of hyperkalemia. This can be followed up by patient's primary care physician. 5. Fall, witnessed. During the hospital stay, patient's health aid reported that patient was sitting on the side of the bed and slipped slowly to the floor. The aid was able to catch and support patient and lower her to the floor (hips on the ground). Thus, patient was unharmed. She did not hit her head or lose consciousness. She denied any pain, tenderness, dizziness\/lightheadedness, chest pain, palpitation. Her physical exam after the incident was unremarkable and essentially the same as prior. Her neurological exam was also unchanged. No further work-up was done. She was instructed to get out of bed and ambulate with assist only. Physical therapy also recommended home ___.

Low dose labetolol was initiated with plan for outpatient follow up. # TACHYCARDIA: Patient was tachycardic to the 120s on arrival, likely related to alcohol and alcohol withdrawal. This improved as patient stopped scoring on CIWA. In addition, patient's home diltiazem was uptitrated to 240 daily. Patient remained persistently tachycardic \/ borderline tachycardic for the remainder of the hospitalization. This was attributed to pain, anxiety, as well as chronic liver disease with low right sided filling pressures. Patient remained asymptomatic.

{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: ___ female with a past medical history significant for newly diagnosed metastatic thyroid cancer, panic disorder with agoraphobia, depression, psychosis, near-complete refusal of preventative care, obesity, and chronic pain. She was recently discharged (___) after being admitted for pain control and for bone biopsy under anesthesia, admitted again for further pain management, found to have unstable C-spine in setting of mass compression. #Metastatic thyroid cancer #C-5 metastatic lesion\/pathologic fracture: Biopsy from her iliac bone from her last admission demonstrated Hurthle cell thyroid carcinoma. MRI obtained ___ showed effacement of C5 and C5 pathological compression fracture as well as multiple calvarian brain mets. She has L hand numbness\/weakness thought to be a consequence of the brain lesion vs. the cervical spinal lesion. Per rad onc, the C5 area is very precarious and radiation without surgical stabilization first could cause fracture and\/or paralysis. She was started on IV dexamethasone 4mg q6h which was switched to PO on discharge. We had many detailed discussions with the patient and her husband with neurosurgery, rad-onc, palliative care, ___, and medicine teams in which patient and husband were informed about the risks and benefits of cervical stabilization surgery, radiation vs comfort care. The patient understands that if she leaves the hospital without surgical stabilization of the cervical spine, she is at risk of c-spine fracture, paralysis, and death. The patient understands these risks and would like to leave the hospital to enjoy this time with her family and discuss with them to make a decision about her treatment moving forward. She understands that there really are two options 1. Surgical stabilization of the cervical spine followed by radiation therapy vs. 2. A more palliative, comfort focused approach. She has been consistent throughout all of these meetings in her absolute refusal to proceed with any surgical intervention. Per the ___ team, further management of her widely metastatic carcinoma would include thyroidectomy surgery and thyroid suppression. Either way, in order to pursue more aggressive treatment, she would need to first proceed with extensive C-spine stabilization surgery. Pt and husband expressed understanding of her difficult situation and precarious cervical spine. However, they did not feel ready to have hospice come into their home and wanted to first discuss her situation with her sons and extended family. We have set up ___ services with the plan for bridge to hospice when she feels they are ready. She will follow up with Dr. ___ (appointment pending), palliative care (appointment pending), and pending further discussions, rad\/onc and\/or neurosurgery as well. # CHRONIC PAIN ___ METASTATIC DISEASE Patient was recently admitted (discharged on ___ for pain management & inpatient biopsy under anesthesia from ___ to ___. During this admission her home Oxycontin was increased from 10 mg to 20mg BID and she was continued on PRN oxycodone. Palliative care also met with patient to assist with pain control and goals of care discussions. She was admitted this admission due to uncontrolled pain on that regimen. Palliative care was involved the entire time. We initially tried a PCA pump of dilaudid, which was not effective because the patient was not pressing the button enough due to anxiety about overdosing. We then switched her back to all oral pain medications, replacing some prn doses with standing doses, which resulted in excellent pain control for the patient without her having to worry too much about asking for prn's. On discharge, the patient feels almost completely pain free, even when up walking around with ___. It seems that the patient gets confused about prn doses and does much better with higher doses of standing doses. The patient preferred that we kept the regimen exactly the same for discharge. We have also outlined above the exact times she should take all of her medications to simplify it for her. This regimen is: - Oxycontin 30mg TID - Oxycodone 10mg q6h standing - Oxycodone 10mg q4h prn breakthrough pain (has not used) - Gabapentin 300mg PO TID - Acetaminophen 650mg Q6hrs standing # CHRONIC MICROCYTIC ANEMIA # HISTORY OF ___ DEFICIENCY Patient has a history of anemia (likely multifactorial in setting of ___ deficiency and anemia of chronic disease in setting of malignancy). It has downtrended during this admission, with Hb low of 6.3. There were no signs of active bleeding. Patient declined blood transfusion as she has always declined in the past. There is likely a component of iron-deficiency given ferritin of 17 in setting of extensive disease. She was given IV ferric gluconate 125mg x 2 days. PO ferrous sulfate 325mg BID was held due to concern for GI side effects. Can consider restarting as outpatient. # HYPERKALEMIA K elevated to 6.0 on ___. Gave calcium, insulin, and dextrose with decline of K to 4.3. Ace-inhibitor was stopped and renal function remained stable with mild CKD. Potassium on discharge was 5.0. We suspect there is a component of hemolyzing, as she had many blood draws with mildly elevated potassium in the morning and the whole blood potassium recheck returned within normal range without any intervention. # Depression, anxiety, psychosis: Patient endorses panic attacks and trauma associated with hospitals. She gets very anxious about bad news. We continued her home sertraline, seroquel, and valium. Her anxiety also improved significantly with pain control as well. The Paient was in communication with her psychiatrist Dr. ___ while in hospital. Per patient's request, the team initially told the patient's husband about any big news first, and allowed him to relay it to her in a more \"gentle\" way. However, as time went by, the patient came more to terms with the fact that she has cancer and is now more accepting of news about her cancer. On discharge, patient is aware of the state of her disease (thyroid carcinoma with full body mets), the risks of leaving the hospital without surgical stabilization of her spine (which include paralysis and death), and her treatment options (palliative vs surgery\/radiation). CHRONIC MEDICAL PROBLEMS ======================== # HYPERTENSION Patient has a known history of hypertension treated with lisinopril. However, her lisinopril was again held due to hyperkalemia (see above). We will hold her lisinopril for now especially given her normotension and it should be re-evaluated as outpatient. # HLD: Continued home statin and aspirin # COPD: Continued home advair and albuterol # GERD: Increased home omeprazole to 40mg daily due to initiation of Decadron (see problem 1 above) TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: =================== -Discharge labs: K 5.0, Hb 6.3, Cr 1.4 -NEW MEDICATIONS: Dexamethasone 4mg q6h, Bisacodyl 10 mg PO BID:PRN Constipation -CHANGED MEDICATIONS: Omeprazole 20mg daily to 40mg daily, Oxycontin 20mg BID to 30mg TID, Oxycodone q3h prn breakthrough to Oxycodone 10mg q6h standing with 10mg q4h prn breakthrough. -STOPPED MEDICATIONS: Lisinopril, Ferrous Sulfate 325 mg PO BID -Specialist followup: palliative care, heme-onc, and pending further discussions: rad-onc +\/- neurosurgery\/spine [ ] Consider tapering decadron as outpatient [ ] We increased her omeprazole to 40 mg daily from 20 mg daily given her steroid dosing [ ] Consider adding back PO iron [ ] Monitor Hb and K [ ] monitor pain control and adjust as tolerated.

She was diagnosed with alzhemers by her neurologist prior to admission. In house a paxil trial has attempted, to see if depression treatement would improve mental status. No improvement was seen and paxil was later d\/ced for fear that in was overly sedating. Imaging showed She has extensive atrophy of her medial temporal lobes and hippocampus. She also has extensive regions of brain infarction and leukoencephalopathy both frontally and cerebellar. Neuro was consulted for management and evaluation for possible communicating hydrocephalus. Per neuro the hydrocephalus is explained by two preocesses- 1) ex vacuo due to atrophy and infarction of brain tissue and 2) loss of white matter firmness and support leads to further ventricular enlargement. These processes are not improved by shunting which carries a substantial risk. Neuro strongly favored not performing an LP or considering placement of a shunt. Secondly, her history of sedatives before MRI leading to profound hypotension is another risk that may outweigh any benefit. . PENDING ISSUES FOR ___: (1) Needs to follow up with cardiologist Dr. ___ for ___ and possible elective electric cardioversion and dig management (2) Patient was discharged on warfarin with goal INR of 2.0 - 3.0.

Carotid ultrasound showed 40-59% stenosis of the internal carotid arteries bilaterally. He had no further syncopal episodes while in house. . # STEMI: Patient initially had positive enyzmes and ST elevations v2-v6. He was given ASA, Plavix, Beta blocker, heparin gtt. He was prehydrated for catheterization. . On ___, repeat EKG showed STE in lateral leads. Enzymes were trended and flat. Pt did not have symptoms. Decision was made to send pt to cardiac cath on ___, demonstrating severe 3 vessel disease. At that point, cardiac surg was consulted for CABG. However, during the morning of ___, pt complained of back pain and STE returned in his lateral leads. Patient was sent again to the cath lab for balloon pump and then transfer to the CCU. . In the ccu, the decision was made not to pursue CABG given multiple medical comorbidities. The patient remained free of chest pain. Medical management including clopidogrel, full dose aspirin, beta blocker, and high dose statin were undertaken. He was weaned off the intra-aortic balloon pump and it was removed. He had a femoral bruit, so US was done which showed no evidence of pseudoaneurysm. . Regarding his coronary disease, the plan was to wait until renal failure resolved and then consider repeat catheterization for revascularization of his LAD. He would need to have this done before any urologic procedure (as below). . # Acute on chronic renal insufficiency: Creatinine on admission was near baseline of 2. After catheterizations, creatinine rose to a high of 5.4. The most likely cause was contrast-induced ATN. He was hydrated, and renal function improved slowly. Creatinine on discharge was 3.2. . # GI bleed: In the CCU, the patient had guaiac positive stools and reported a history of melena. He was given pRBC to maintain Hct >28. GI did an upper endoscopy that showeed erosive gastritis and duodenitis, likely the source of bleeding. He was given BID PPI. Per GI, this would not preclude heparinization for cardiac procedure if needed. . # Renal mass: On non-contrast abdominal CT, patient was found to have a 4 cm L renal mass that was confirmed by ultrasound to be solid. The urology team evaluated the patient and recommended outpatient follow-up for MR with gadolinium after renal function improves. After speaking with his nephrologist (Dr. ___ at ___, he should NOT get MR with gadolinium at any point but should instead have a contrast CT after kidney function improves. He could potentially undergo resection, after LAD is revascularized, if the disease is localized. . # Mild Chronic Systolic heart Failure: Echo from outside hospital showed overall mildly depressed EF of 40-45% but with focal wall motion abnormality. He was on lasix as an outpatient which was held because of acute renal failure. On discharge, he will need to have daily weights and reinstitution of diuretics as needed. . # Hypertension: The patient had a history of chronic hypertension, likely exacerbated by not taking his clonidine the morning of admission. He initially received a nitro drip, transitioning to hydralazine and later to home medications including beta blocker, amlodipine, and clonidine (changed from tablet to patch). Lisinopril was held for renal failure. He was normotensive on this regimen. . # Left orbital edema: The patient had left orbital edema on admission. Head CT at ___ negative for fracture, no point tenderness on exam. The edema resolved within days. . # Leukocytosis: The patient briefly developed leukocytosis. CXR showed a possible L lower lobe infiltrate. He was afebrile and asymptomatic, and the leukocytosis resolved within days. The most likely cause was aspiration pneumonitis. He should be observed while eating until his mental status improves to baseline. . # Hypernatremia: Sodium the day of discharge was slightly elevated at 148. This will need to be followed at the rehab facility.","summary":"You were admitted to the hospital because you passed out. You were found to have a heart attack.

Her pain was initially controlled with IV dilaudid, although the medication made her quite drowsy. She was converted to PO dilaudid prior to discharge and was kept on stool softeners while taking opioids. She was started on gabapentin, which was titrated up to 300mg TID by the time of discharge. She was also given lidocaine jelly to apply over the painful areas. It was felt that capsaicin would not be a good idea considering the degree of her pain. Her itching was controlled with Benadryl and Atarax at first, and then Eucerin cream was added. She was discharged with Eucerin cream and instructions to take Benadryl or Atarax as needed. . # Hypertension: On admission she was hyponatremic, thought to be due to a combination of pain and her HCTZ. The HCTZ was changed to lisinopril with improvement in the hyponatremia and adequate control of her BPs.
