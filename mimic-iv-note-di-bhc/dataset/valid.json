She was started on ASA, Plavix, Atorvastatin, metoprolol and lisinopril during her hospital course. ___ showed mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of the basal half of the inferior and inferolateral walls. Immediately following PCI she was in 2:1 heart block, which subsequently evolved to Wenckebach and 1:1 conduction. She remained hemodynamically stable throughout and was discharged home with cardiology and PCP follow up. # VSD: Physical exam on admission to the CCU revealed a new III\/VI systolic murmur heard thoughout the precordium concerning for new VSD\/MR. ___ showed VSD, cardiac MRI later showed 3:1 shunt fraction, normal RV size with free wall hypokinesis and elevated PA pressures. Her O2 sat remained >93% on RA throughout her course and she was given diuresis for reducing pulmonary edema and shunt, and minimizing pulmonary hypertension. Blood pressure was also optimized to decrease afterload and maximize forward flow. The definite treatment will require surgical repair of the interventricular septum defect. Percutaneous VSD closure may also be an option. OUTPATIENT ISSUES: - F\/U WITH CT SURGERY\/INTERVENTIONAL CARDIOLOGY - Adjust lasix 80 mg po qd - Should have RHC to assess shunt function which could help decide whether patient needs to have her shunt fixed # A-fib: Pt was found to have a period of unsustained symptomatic A-fib, lasting ~30 mins. This could be a result of changes in RA volume and dynamics. Given patient's already compromised CO, atrial kick is necessary to maintain adequate MAP. Amiodarone was started for rhythm control.

Described as the \"right side of the room was cut in half\", no true vision loss. Immediately prior to this, he experienced some dizziness and lightheadedness while sitting, when attempting to stand he drifted forward and caught himself without an actual fall. His symptoms resolved after standing. He went to the ED and his symptoms were largely resolved, his NIHSS was 0. His general and neurologic review of systems was otherwise unremarkable. His neurologic exam was notable for poor vision (right ___, left ___, blurry right-sided vision when left eye covered, full visual fields, normal fundoscopic exam, slight right arm pronation, and slightly wide based gait (see below #gait disorder). He had a brain MRI that was negative for acute or prior stroke (notably, ADC demonstrated questionable bright lesion in L basal ganglia area, per review with neuroradiology likely volume averaging, not stroke), CTA does with significant carotid atherosclerosis. While his monocular symptoms are certainly concerning for transient ischemic event, particularly an atherothrombolic event, this is unlikely given reassuring visual exam and MRI, as well as a history that does not suggest true vision loss. His serum risk factors for stroke were LDL 91, HgA1c 5.5. He was started on aspirin and his home simvastatin dose was increased. Other explanations for his vision changes include poor baseline vision given age. Low suspicion for amaurosis fugax per description of event, or temporal arteritis given normal inflammatory markers and lack of headache, temporal pain. Given low suspicion for ischemic event, ophthalmology evaluated the patient and found no occular pathology. #Gait disorder #Peripheral Neuropathy Patient with longstanding history of mild peripheral neuropathy of unclear etiology and gait instability.

{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: Ms. ___ is a ___ lady with a h\/o cocaine and IV heroin use who was transferred from an OSH due to MRSA sepsis from endocarditis complicated by lung abscesses. She was in serious condition for much of her hospitalization, but she never decompensated into septic shock. Her hospital course was notable for recurrent sinus tachycardia and fevers to 103, management of neutrophil-predominant pleural effusions s\/p thoracenteses\/chest tubes, brief MICU transfer for somnolence, and brief MICU transfer for hypoxia. She improved slowly on Vancomycin IV. When her chest tubes had been removed, and she was breathing comfortably on room air, and she became afebrile for >24H, she was discharged to rehab to complete her antibiotic course. #. MRSA Sepsis: endocarditis with lung abscesses. Fever to 103 with rigors, sinus tachycardia to 140, leukocytosis to 21K, and tachypnea all represented systemic response to her infection. She grew MRSA from BCx at the OSH, but here the only (+) was the very first blood culture - all subsequent cultures were negative. Though she had no murmur on exam, with MRSA bacteremia and continued fevers, clinically fits with endocarditis. Most likely right-sided IE given that patient is IVDU, as well as the fact that she has lung emboli and no obvious left-sided peripheral emboli (head CT negative, MRI spine negative for abscess, CT abdomen negative for splenic abscess). ___ TTE's did suggest a ?right-sided vegetation but this was not seen on subsequent TTE or TEE. She continued to spike high fevers with infectious w\/u negative for another cause, and these continued fevers were likely due to septic lung abscesses. Effusions were managed with drainage (see below). She was followed closely by ID who recommended continuing Vancomycin, though she was changed to Daptomycin prior to discharge due to rash (see below). Over time, she exhibited less septic physiology, and she became more comfortable. Her leukocytosis resolved completely (WBC 5.4 on discharge). She started to ambulate, breathing comfortably and was weaned to room air. She stopped spiking fevers (last fever was 102.9 at 2400 on ___, >2 days before discharge). At this point, she was discharged to rehab to complete her treatment course; proposed end-day is ___ which will complete a 6-week course. She should have weekly CBC, CHEM7, LFTs, and CPK faxed to ATTN: ___ OPAT RNs at fax# ___. She will follow-up in ___ clinic in 2.5 weeks (scheduled). #. Pleural effusions: neutrophil-predominant parapneumonic effusions, not empyema, slowly resolving. Interventional Pulmonary was following. She underwent the following procedures: ___ right thoracentesis ___ left chest tube insertion (removed) ___ left chest tube insertion (removed ___ right thoracentesis The fluid was not consistent with empyema and likely represents inflammation due to her infection. No growth from pleural fluid culture. Based on imaging, the pleural effusion size has decreased. In the future, if effusions do not resolve, she might require further procedures including possible pleurodesis. She requires repeat CT chest in ~1 month to ensure that the effusions have resolved (scheduled); she also has follow-up scheduled at ___ Interventional Pulmonary clinic. #. Rash: likely from Vancomycin. On the evening of ___ she was noted to have a mild thigh rash but by the next day she had erupted into a maculopapular blanching rash on her thighs, upper chest, back, and lower abdomen (arms were spared). Also had a follicular-pattern rash on her legs. No fever or leukocytosis. Only mildly pruritic. No mucosal involvement. It was felt that this likely represented a reaction to Vancomycin (even though it was started weeks prior). Per I.D. recommendations, she was changed to Daptomycin, which she tolerated without complication. #. Somnolence requiring MICU transfer: resolved, likely a medication effect. Patient was transferred to the ICU ___ due to being found very lethargic. Review of her medications revealed several narcoticts and benzodiazepines that were suggestive of iatrogenic somnolence. Opiods and benzodiazepines were held, with return of patient's baseline mental status. Pain consult was performed who suggested no further IV pain medications, with use of Oxycodone instead. She did not require Narcan and had no further episodes of somnolence. #. Hypoxia requiring MICU transfer: resolved, likely from lung abscesses, effusions, fever. Patient was transferred to the ICU ___ due to hypoxia (POx in the ___ on 4L NC). Was likely related to her underlying lung infection and large effusions. She underwent chest tube placement with some resolution. Also, she might have had desaturation during fevers due to vasodilation and loss of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction leading to shunt physiology. She never required ventilatory assistance; she improved and was on 4L NC for much of her admission. By the time of discharge, she was weaned to room air but was intermittently using O2 for comfort. #. Pain control: complicated by her h\/o IV heroin use and addiction. Chronic Pain Service agreed that she is not a candidate for long term opioid therapy, but she did require some IV Dilaudid in the setting of chest tube placements and other procedures. By the time of discharge, she was weaned to Oxycodone ___ PO Q4H PRN, and further down-titration and eventual cessation of narcotic pain meds would be appropriate while she is at rehab. She also continues on Tylenol, Lidocaine patch, and Gabapentin for pain control. Had some mild dyspepsia with NSAIDs but these could certainly be used as well. She would benefit from follow-up with an addiction specialist. # Anemia: unclear etiology, resolved. Hct was 29.6 on admission, had a nadir of 20.8 on ___, and was 29.6 on discharge. hemolysis\/DIC workup negative and she was guaiac negative. Likely from decreased RBC production and possibly from bleeding due to procedures. She received a total of 6u pRBCs this admission. Hct was stable at the time of discharge and she had no signs of bleeding. #. Leg swelling: resolving. She had symmetric leg edema and right ankle swelling, likely from requiring large volumes of IV fluids. TTE showed good pump function. LENIs were negative and ankle film showed no fracture. With mobility and ambulation, the edema is resolving (currently trace edema upon discharge). #. Psych: initial presentation with SI, but no SI this admission. She was closely followed by Social Work this admission. She has expressed an interest in working on her mental health, mostly because she wishes to stay healthy for her son. She never had any SI or HI while hospitalized here. She should have follow-up with mental health providers after discharge. She continues on Clonazepam. #. h\/o IV heroine use and cocaine use: patient wishes to stay drug-free. She was tested for HIV, HCV, and HBV which were negative. As mentioned above, she was followed closely by Social Work. She did describe herself as a \"heroin addict\" and hopes to be able to stay drug-free after discharge. She had no signs\/symptoms of withdrawal this admission, but was treated with Clonidine initially (not continued upon discharge). She should have follow-up with mental health providers after discharge. #. ?ADHD: was a pre-admission diagnosis. She is prescribed Adderall extended release 30mg PO QAM and Adderall 30mg BID as an outpatient (confirmed with her pharmacy). Unclear indication. She requested to be restarted on Adderall and she was put on Adderall 10mg daily. She should be encouraged to wean off amphetamine-based medication given her cocaine\/heroin history. #.

{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: # Altered Mental Status: The patient was initially brought in to be evaluated for possible confusion per his family. However on further questioning, he initially appeared to be at his relative baseline (blind, nearly deaf, left hemiplegia, intermittently saying ___ words with signficant stimulation but rarely oriented). An RPR was found to be mildy positive and neurosyphyllis was thought to be possibly contributing to his confusion. To this end a lumbar puncture under fluoroscopic guidance was pursued. However, due to decompensation (see below) the LP was not completed. Given the risk of a repeat LP, under guidance from the infectious disease department, it was decided to treat him for presumed neurosyphyllis. He received 2 weeks of IV ceftriaxone, completed in house, with little improvement of his mental status after his arrest. After his arrest, the patients mental status became essentially unresponsive to any stimuli. Repeat CT head and EEG showed no acute process. The patient could not receive an MRI due to a pacemaker. In consultation with neurology, his new baseline may be a result of some anoxic brain injury. . # PEA arrest: The morning of his lumbar puncture, a CXR showed complete opacification of his right lung, likely indicating a significant mucous plug at that time. At baseline, he has a large, chronic, loculated pleural effusion that compresses most of the right lung, leaving only a small section aerated. During his lumbar puncture procedure, the patient suffered a PEA arrest and was down for approximately 5 minutes. He was resuscitated with CPR. As above, after the arrest, his mental status was essentially unresponsive. His ability to protect his airway was significantly decreased. After initial extubation after his arrest, he required frequent nasal trumpet suctioning to prevent recurrent mucous plugging. Even with frequent suctioning, he had several further mucous plugging events with significant desaturations requiring acute suction. The last such event was a near respiratory arrest on the general medical floor requiring re-intubation. After lengthy discussion with his family, it was decided to place a tracheostomy to attempt to minimize further mucous plugging events and ease suctioning, as he was having significant nasopharyngeal trauma from NT suctioning. Hyocamine tabs and mucomyst nebs were added to decrease and help clear secretions. He will require frequent suctioning and close monitoring of his airway to minimize further plugging events. The family was made aware that the tracheostomy may not prevent further events and that his overall mortality in the next year is significant. They feel strongly that the patient would want to continue living no matter what the cost. Extensive discussions were held regarding goals of care and code status with no change in his full code status. The family's overall goal is to bring the patient home if at all possible. . # Respiratory Failure: As noted above, his last mucous plugging event resulted in reintubation. He is in the process of weening ventilatory support, currently on PS ventilation, ___, 40% with good respiratory mechanics. His ventilatory support should continue to be weened as tolerated with possible trach collar soon. Of note, given his poor right lung, it is unlikely that the patient will ever have a satisfactory RSBI. Sputum culture from ___ grew pseudomonas and pan-sensitive klebsiella. The patient had no evidence of actual pneumonia at that time. It was felt that the pseudomonas was likely a colonizer given that the exact same strain has been isolated from sputum cultures months prior. The klebsiella was concurrently treated during his 2 week course of ceftriaxone as above. Prior to discharge, a sputum culture was growing pseudomonas and one other gram negative rod. Again, he had no other clinical signs of pneumonia so new antibiotics were not started. Further follow of sputum culture should occur and if the patient decompensates, consideration of antibiotics treating pseudomonas should occur. . # Pyuria: Patient had a grossly positive UA. Ceftriaxone and vancomycin were given initially. Piperacillin-tazobactam was added and ceftriaxone discontinued when he became hypothermic and altered requiring ICU transfer. He was ultimately found to have a VRE urinary tract infection. He was treated with linezolid, with a recommended course of 7 days. . . # Hypothermia: On the first hospital day the patient's temperature dropped to <96 farenheit. Other vital signs were stable. Given concominant leukopenia and positive UA, this was concerning for sepsis. Blood cultures were sent, and warming blankets were placed. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit for closer monitoring in the setting of likely sepsis, his antibiotic regimen was broadened to vancomycin\/zosyn. His hypothermia improved. He has been hypothermic on his last several admissions. It may be that his physiologic response to infection is hypothermia rather than hyperthermia, or he is an outlier at the lower extreme of temperature at baseline. On the floor after transfer out of the ICU he initially needed a bearhugger to maintain temperatures >96 and cultures done at that time were negative. He eventually was able to maintain temperatures ranging ___ without the assistance of a bear hugger. . #. ESRD: Family reported episode of fistula bleeding the previous day. Pressure dressing was in place on admission. Hct was decreased, possible secondary to this. Transplant surgery initially evaluated the fistula and determined that it was functional and ready for use. However, later on re-evaluation transplant surgery felt that his fistula needed revision prior to discharge. This was done and further hemodialysis should be avoided from his fistula for 2 weeks from ___. A tunnelled femoral HD line was placed for HD access until that time under ___ guidance. Dialysis was continued MWF schedule. Midodrine was added to help improve his BP prior to dialysis to assist with volume removal and to combat possible autonomic dysfunction given wide swings in blood pressure. . Enlarged Thyroid: He had chest imaging to evaluate pulmonary function. An incidential finding of thyromegaly was noted. TFTs are recommended as an outpatient. . #. Hypernatremia: This was likely secondary to hypovolemia and resolved. . #. Coronary artery disease: Aspirin, and simvastatin were continued. . #. Hypertension: Lisinopril was continued. . #. Type II DM: Oral hypoglycemics were initially held and ISS given, but restarted as his blood sugars became elevated. His lantus was increased from 12 U QHS to 16 U QHS with effect. . . #. Adrenal insufficiency- He is on 5mg prednisone daily at baseline. There was an initial concern for sepsis, thus he got high dose steroids,however ___ stim test was wnl. He was thus tapered, and returned to his home dose of 5mg daily prior to discharge. . #. Access: He has poor vasculature. Initial PICC was placed which was pulled back to midline prior to discharge as it was coming out a little. . #. CODE STATUS: Full code status was confirmed with the family.","summary":"You were admitted to the hospital because you were confused, and had also been having some vomiting, and bleeding from your fistula. You were found to have an infection of your urine which was treated with antibiotics. In the setting of working up your confusion, a lumbar puncture was attempted.

{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: ___ with hypertension and diabetes who is admitted after being discharged on ___ after resection of craniopharyngioma on ___ with central diabetes insipidus and headache. # Central diabetes insipidus: The patient has central diabetes insipidus manifesting with hypernatremia, polyuria and substantial thirst in the post-neurosurgical setting. The patient had been managed with PO demospressin on discharge. There was concern that the patient had taken her desmopressin with food after discharge, which may have interfered with the drug's absorption and led to her hypernatremia. The patient was initially given D5W IV with good response in her sodium level. Endocrinology was consulted. The patient was initially monitored with q4 hour serum sodium and urine specific gravity\/osmolality checks. A foley was placed and urine output was monitored hourly. The patient was initially dosed with desmopressin when she would \"break through\" with >300cc of urine output per hour for two consecutive hours. Her desmopressin dosing was gradually stabilized to 0.2mg QHS, with strict instructions to not take with food. The patient was strongly encouraged to drink to thirst. Her labs were spaced out to twice daily. She still had occasional morning hypernatremia that was likely a consequence of the patient not drinking fluids overnight.

The history and exam was suggestive of hypomania, but further evaluation for medical causes of alterred mental status were pursued given his history of immunosuppresion in the setting of liver transplant. The patient endorsed marijuana use, but denied any other illicit drug use and his tox screens were negative. There was initially a concern for tacrolimus toxicity given his elevated level to 17.1 on ___, although this was felt to be an inaccurate trough level as his repeat tacrolimus level was 3.5. No meningeal signs on exam to suggest meningitis. Extensive infectious workup was unrevealing (negative urinalysis, negative CXR, RPR negative, HIV negative, CMV viral load undetected, lyme negative, EBV tested in the past c\/w previous infection, HSV ___ positive).

After her ED course, pain resolved and feelings of acute shortness of breath resolved, however low O2 saturations in the ED on exertion to 79% were concerning, and patient was admitted for further work up. . PLAN: *Chest pain: Patient presented with acute onset of chest pressure, jaw pain and arm pain. Although she generally has about ___ episodes a week that are relieved by nitroglycerin, this episode was notable for no decrease in pain with treatment. Additionally, the specific symptoms of jaw pain and chest pressure are not present with her usual episodes of chest pain. Her labs are notable for negative troponin, that was trended and remained negative. Stress test showed no anginal symptoms or ischemic ST segment changes. Nuclear stress test was performed as well which showed no new changes in heart function or perfusion. Given the lack of F\/C, time course of chest pain, and symptoms, suspect that her chest pain symptoms were not attributable to flow-limiting coronary disease. She did not have a recurrence of pain, and her vital signs and telemetry were monitored and stable throughout admission. She will follow up with her PCP for further management. . *Shortness of breath: Patient noted shortness of breath on admission. Her D-Dimer in the ED was negative, given her low Well's criteria score, and low clinical suspicion, no additional tests for PE were performed as this effectively r\/o thromboembolic process. No recent history of URI, so less likely to be infectious. Given the timing of SOB coinciding with chest pain, likely cardiac or COPD exacerbation.

ABG showed pH of 7.39, pO2 of 72, pCO2 of 42. Likely due to chronic COPD. Pulmonology saw her and thought this is most likely due to her long-standing COPD that has likely been chronic, and that this hypoxia is most likely not a new event. They recommended an ECHO with bubble study to rule out right to left shunting as an outpatient and recommended home O2. On day of discharge, patient was comfortable, 96% on 2L O2, without chest pain or shortness of breath. . *Anemia: patient has anemia on CBC with most recent Hct of 31.7.

{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: Mr. ___ is a ___ year old man with HgbSS disease, recurrent vasoocclusive crises, history of priapism, chronic hep C (viral load undetectable at ___ in ___ and polysubstance abuse who presented to ___ with acute onset low back pain consistent with vasoocclusive crisis. Active diagnoses: #Vasoocclusive crises: He was admitted for a 1 day history of severe lower back pain in the setting of a Hemoglobin SS disease (sickle cell disease). Smear was suggestive of active sickling and hemolysis making the cause of his pain likely an acute pain crisis. Pain was limited to the R paraspinal area of the lumbar spine and there was no evidence of midline lumbar spine involvement (no tenderness to palpation). There was no evidence of priapism (he has a prior Hx of priapism). Treatment consisted of pain control and IVFs with ___ normal saline. Pain was adequately controlled per the patient and by HD#2 and the pain had returned to his baseline. He was actually treated with less than his home regimen of oxycodone. He also received 1 u pRBCs on HD #1 which likely contributed to his improvement. His hemoglobin at discharge was 7.5. This is within his historical range for hemoglobin at discharge from ___ in the past few months. He should have a follow up CBC on ___ in ___ clinic. Home folate and hydroxyurea were continued. #Hypoxemia: In the late morning on hospital day #1 he was found to have O2 sats to the mid-80s on room air. His saturation quickly improved to >95% on 2L of O2. On further auscultation he appeared to have decreased breath sounds and dullness to percussion at the R lung base. However, a CXR was done and no major consolidation was noted. The etiology of his hypoxemia remains unclear, though it was most likely related to hypoventilation as he was very somnolent on hospital day #1. Acute chest crisis (ACS) was unlikely given his normal CXR and lack of chest pain or shortness of breath. On the day of discharge he was 94% on room air and his lungs were clear on examination. #Hemoglobin SS disease\/Macrocytic Anemia: On initial presentation to the ED (___) his Hct was 23.3. The following morning (___), his Hct was noted to have dropped to 20.8, though after significant IV fluid. His anemia was likely due to a hemolysis from sickle cell disease, as confirmed by labs and peripheral smear. His bilirubin was elevated (6.4. total), haptoglobin level decreased (<5), LDH elevated (612) and reticulocyte was increased (12.8), as expected with a hemolytic anemia. He was transfused with 1 unit of pRBCs. On repeat Hct he was 23.1. He should have outpatient CBC done on ___ in ___ clinic. #Somnolence: Upon admission to the floor (HD #1) he was noted to have significant somnolence, often appearing to doze off during history taking and physical exam. This was thought to be due to overmedicating with pain medications and so his oxycodone and hydromorphone doses were reduced. It was also thought that he may have ingested other substances prior to admission, including long acting oxycodone, which he has at home. He has a history of substance abuse and was noted to have ingested cocaine this weekend. Tox screening from the ED was negative though it did not test for opiates and is unreliable for certain benzodiazepines. He did not produce a urine sample for testing for methadone and other CNS depressants. Given his return to normal mental status on HD#2 it is highly likely that his period of AMS was due to overmedication. He was counseled to avoid excessive narcotic use and combinations with other drugs. He was prescribed a bowel regimen given his chronic opiate use. Chronic Diagnoses: #Chronic Hepatitis C: Possibly resolved. Hep C antibody positive ___. Viral load negative at ___ in ___, though it is unclear if he was treated or cleared the infection himself. This is related to blood transfusions for Sickle Cell Disease, per patient and chart review. He denies prior IV drug use. Could consider repeating viral load or clarifying treatment with patient to ensure no longer has active disease that would require treatment. #Polysubstance abuse: He reported that he had used cocaine a day or two prior to admission - this is an issue that his outpatient hematologist has spoken with him about before and which will need further outpatient workup as it is likely an exacerbating factor for his underlying sickle cell disease. He was counseled to avoid excessive narcotic use and combinations with other drugs. He was prescribed a bowel regimen given his chronic opiate use. Transitional Issues: -repeat CBC in 2 weeks to evaluate Hgb\/Hct -consider down-titration of opiates given somnolence when admitted on less than home doses of oxycodone -set up outpatient PCP, currently ___ NP managing his care, though he stated he was getting a new PCP -___ repeating HCV viral load or clarifying treatment with patient to ensure no longer has active disease that would require treatment.","summary":"you were admitted because of suspected pain crisis from sickle cell disease causing low back pain.

What is a collapsed lung? A collapsed lung, also called a pneumothorax, happens when air enters the space between your rib cage and one of your lungs. The air causes all or part of the lung to collapse. It is then hard to breathe normally and your body gets less oxygen. A collapsed lung can be life-threatening. In some cases, the air collecting around the lung can completely collapse the lung and put pressure on the heart. Then the heart cannot pump normally. A collapsed lung may be caused by an injury to the chest, such as a car accident, stab or bullet wound, or broken ribs. It may also be caused by lung damage from chronic lung diseases, electric shock, or near drowning. Sometimes there is no known cause for the lung to collapse. This is called a spontaneous pneumothorax."}

EKG, echo not concerning for repeat effusion\/pericarditis. # Hyperlipidemia: He has highly elevated cholesterol due to his PBC, and most recent lipid panel on ___ with TC 724, ___ 311, HDL 12, and LDL 141. The benefit of statins in PBC is unclear, and statins can certainly be associated with liver injury. He reports that his hepatologist discontinued his home atorvastatin, and this was held in house as well. # Vitamin D Deficiency: His last Vitamin D level on ___ was undetectable. He was continued on cholecalciferol and calcium carbonate. # Chronic Pain: There was concern that his narcotics could be contributing to fecal loading despite bowel regimen. He was continued on home regimen, but bowel regimen was uptitrated. He was managed with fentanyl patch, gabapentin, and oxycodone. # Bipolar Disorder: Continued on home risperidone. TRANSITIONAL ISSUES ==================== - Code status: Full code, confirmed. - Emergency contact: Father ___ ___. - Studies pending on discharge: All finalized. - Noted to have constipation, so bowel regimen was increased. - We re-educated on low sodium diet (appears to be not fully compliant with low sodium diet; ie, eating at ___ and ___).","summary":"You were admitted because of abdominal pain and a lightheaded feeling. You underwent studies which showed you did not have any concerning issues with your heart. We checked blood and urine and could not find evidence of infection. Your abdominal studies were not concerning, and we think your abdominal pain was related to constipation. You were monitored and improved. It is important for you to stay well-hydrated. You should have at leave 2 liters (64oz) or water or Power Aid per day. You also should have a low-salt diet. Be careful when you eat out as most ___ put a lot of salt in their food.

He was transferred to the medicine service for hypoxia and atrial fibrillation. His hypoxia improved with diuresis, but still occurred with ambulation. His afib was controlled with metoprolol. He was discharged home. # Hypoxia # COPD due to alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency with acute exacerbation Patient with new-onset hypoxia while inpatient. Cause is likely multifactorial. Likely from splinting from pain + pulmonary edema RVR and IVF + COPD exacerbation. CTA was negative for PE. Patient was given one dose of Lasix for diuresis. He was given incentive spirometer and DuoNebs. He was continued on tiotropium daily, and fluticasone\/salmeterol BID. His oxygen requirement at rest gradually resolved during hospitalization, however he was still desatting on ambulation at time of discharge, and was discharged with home O2. Please continue to monitor ambulatory oxygenation. # Afib # Mild right ventricle hypokinesis Patient went into afib with RVR two separate times during the hospitalization that broke with 5mg IV metoprolol. His rates were controlled on metoprolol succinate 25mg daily. This appears to be newly diagnosed afib. Trigger likely pain from fall and volume overload given fluids patient received in ED. However, given his comorbidities, it's also possible that patient has had afib for quite some time and has just been undiagnosed. CHADSVASC=4. Echo with EF 55%, mild right ventricle. hypokinesis. Cardiology was consulted. Given his history of falls, he was not discharged on anticoagulation. He should follow-up with an outpatient cardiologist for a further discussion of the risks and benefits of anticoagulation. He was also discharged with ___ of Hearts monitor to assess burden of afib. # Chest wall pain # Fall and R ___ rib fractures ACS evaluated the patient and has signed off. Pain was well controlled with Tylenol, a lidocaine patch, and his home gabapentin. # DMI # Hyperglycemia Patient with history of T1DM. It appears that fall was from hypoglycemia as he has history of convulsions and syncope from hypoglycemia. ___ Diabetes team followed him during his hospitalization and changed insulin regimen as needed. Of note, patient did take his home insulin on at least one occasion, even though he was instructed not to administer his own insulin while in the hospital. # Bipolar Disorder Continued home Seroquel. # Glaucoma: Substituted latanoprost for home Lumigan (nonformulary). TRANSITIONAL ISSUES =================== - Patient should designate a healthcare proxy - Outpatient cardiology is scheduled at ___ with Dr. ___ ___. Patient should follow-up for consideration of anticoagulation given new onset atrial fibrillation. He was discharged with ___ of ___ monitor and instructions to call and activate it. He should also have repeat echo in 6 months given mild hypokinesis seen on echo. - Discuss anticoagulation outpatient given h\/o falls it was held on discharge. - Continue to closely monitor blood sugars - Patient was unable to receive home once-weekly ___ while inpatient. Please ensure that patient continues to receive this medication. - He demonstrated memory issues while inpatient. Please continue to assess safety for home as he lives alone. - Previously noted pulmonary nodules on CT are similar or decreased in size. Please continue to monitor. - We would advise that the patient undergo additional evaluation for potential chronic liver dysfunction, given his mild but non-resolving thrombocytopenia, isolated AST elevation, hx of heavy EtOH use in the past, and known alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency.

{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: Pt is an ___ yo man with history of chronic systolic CHF (last EF 40%), pulmonary HTN, severe TR, diabetes type 2 now controlled off meds, afib on warfarin and congestive cirrhosis, who presents with abdominal pain and hypotension, and found to have acute on chronic renal insufficiency, hyponatremia and alkalosis. Pt was initially admitted to the MICU given hypotension. He was given IVF's and his SBP improved into the 100s. . #. Hypotension: Likely ___ hypovolemic etiology given clinically dry, elevated BUN\/Cr, recent increased diuresis and poor po intake. Patient in clinic recently noted to have weight of 115 lbs down from 135 lbs between ___ and ___. Pt had no s\/s infection and no leukocytosis to suggest infectious etiology or sepsis. He was given IVF's and his BP improved. He was given one dose of Zosyn in the ED, though this was not continued on admission. Cultures were sent. UA was unremarkable, and CXR without infiltrate. He was not continued on antibotics, and was given fluid resuscitation with IVF boluses. His SBP was in the 100s on discharge. His hypotension was felt most likely to overdiuresis, and thus his spironolactone and furosemide dosages were decreased as per medication reconcillation. We also lowered his dose of Metoprolol given his borderline hypotension in house; this can be uptitrated in the future as needed. We also discontinued the patient's metolazone. . #. Acute on Chronic systolic CHF: With volume status restored, patient had slight volume overload and diuretics were slowly re-introduced. This was evidenced by right pleural effusion and increased requirement for oxygen at rest. Physical exam of right lung base and symptoms of dyspnea improved over a few days when diuretics were re-introduced at lower dose. ___ was held because of hypotenstion. . #. Abdominal pain: Unclear etiology, but seemed to have resolved prior to admission. DDx includes constipation vs. SBP vs. cholelithiasis vs. pancreatitis vs. ileus vs. gastritis. Lipase is elevated, though clinically pt has no epigastric pain, and clinical story of location of pain and duration is not c\/w pancreatitis. Pt is passing gas and had BM so ileus less likely, in addition to no obstruction seen on CT. Cholelithiasis certainly possible given brief intermittent pain, that has now since resolved. Elevated alk phos and AST could be explained by intermittent cholelithiasis. Given guaiac positive stools, gastritis also possible, though intermittent nature makes this less likely. LFTs were within normal limits, and RUQ u\/s showed no evidence of infection, although it did show coarse echotexture of the liver, with lobulated contour compatible with cirrhosis, a small amount of ascites, a small right pleural effusion, and cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis. #. Dysphagia: Patient was seen in hospital for a speeh and swallow evaluation. They recommend a diet of soft moist solids and thin liquids, as well as further evaluation by speech and swallow at his facility. #. GI bleed: Patient's Hct trended down in house and stool was confirmed to be guiac positive. Upper endoscopy showed no varices, but erosions in the stomach and vascular ectasia of the duodenum. No varices were seen. His coumadin was held for this procedure and re-started afterwards. On discharge, his Hct was trending upwards to 28.4 from 25 two days prior, and there was no frank blood or melena ever observed in his stool. This is likely a slow, chronic GI bleed and felt to be stable. Iron supplements continued. # Acute on chronic renal insufficiency: Likely pre-renal in setting of poor po intake, and diuresis as discussed above. ATN also possible given BP slightly lower than baseline. Post-obstructive etiologies much less likely on the differential. FeUrea 31%, suggestive of pre-renal etiology. He was given IVF's as discussed above and ___ was trended down to 1.2 on discharge, which is his baseline. # Metabolic Alkalosis with resp compensation: Pt has significant alkalosis with HCO3 of 36 on admission, has been higher up to 39. Suspect that this is contraction alkalosis ___ overdiuresis. ABG obtained showed ___, suggestive of respiratory compensation. Lytes were trended with correction of bicarb to 33 on day of discharge. # Elevated troponin: Trop was elevated to 0.25 from prior 0.11. However, in the setting of elevated Cr, this is the most likely etiology. Reassuring that EKG unchanged, and pt has no chest pain. CK, MB were stable upon a recheck during admission. #. Hyponatremia: Hypovolemic hyponatremia as evidenced by picture of dehydration as discussed above. Na much lower from baseline by ~ 10pts. Diuretics were held and he was given IVF's. Na was trended up to 135 on discharge secondary to IVF, good PO intake, and the holding of his diuretics. #. Anemia: Microcytic, suspect iron deficiency. Possible etiologies include upper slow bleed given brown stools, such erosions and duodenal ectasia. No reported bloody or black stools, which is reassuring. Hct on admission is 29, and baseline is closer to ___. However, suspect that this is hemoconcentrated given picture of dehydration as discussed above. Volume status was restored and Hct recovered to 28 on d\/c. Fe studies and retic count were sent, which showed no evidence of hemolysis, and without reticulocytosis to suggest bleeding. Iron studies were wnl. Patient was discharged back on his home dose of 20 mg daily of omeprazole. # Atrial fibrillation: Chronically on Warfarin, for CHADS 4 (CHF, HTN, Age and Diabetes). However, INR subtherapeutic on admission to 1.3. Listed on dc summary and in some nursing notes per rehab, but not on primary list. Held Toprol XL initially given hypotension. Placed on heparin gtt briefly, but on discharge was therapeutic on Coumadin at 5.5 mg Daily at 2.1. Metoprolol was re-started at 25mg PO daily before d\/c. # Lower extremity wounds: Exam c\/w venous stasis ulcers with no evidence of superinfection. Wound was consulted for care. # Diabetes: last A1c from ___ 6.6. Not currently on any medications for diabetes. Suspect that he no longer requires meds given his weight loss. Placed on QID ___ and ISS, and was discharged on diet control for diabetes. # Hyperthyroidism: TSH 3.7 on ___. Besides weight loss, likely ___ issues of poor po intake & diuresis, no other s\/s hyperthyroidism. Continued on methimazole 5mg daily. Transitional Issues: - Please monitor weights daily for change greater than 3 lbs in weight gain - Please have the patient follow-up with his CHF clnic, whom has been managing his medications. - Please follow-up ___ Blood cultures for any signs of microorganism growth (NGTD) - Please monitor fluid status daily, with low threshold to uptitrate spironolactone back to prior dosing.","summary":"You were admitted to the hospital because you had an episode of abdominal pain and your blood pressure was very low.

{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: ___ is a ___ year old man with chronic diastolic CHF who presented with SOB, DOE, and orthopnea and a large R pleural effusion after having his bumex dose recently decreased. His was admitted and believed to be in an acute on chronic diastolic CHF exacerbation and was given IV Lasix. His pleural thoracentesis was delayed originally due to a supertherapeutic INR. The day after admission, he developed rigors and a temperature of 101.4. He was started on epiric broad spectrum coverage with Vancomycin, Cefipime and Flagyl. His blood cultures at that time revealed MSSA bactermia and his coverage was narrowed to Nafcillin starting on ___. . The nidus of his bacteremia was explored. His thoracentesis occured hours after his rigors and he was found to have an exudative effusion by Lytes criteria, however, the effusion cultures and cytology were negative. He had a CT of his chest which did not reveal any consolidation or pneumonia. Of note, he has history of pleural effusion with enterococcal bactermia in past. His echocardiogram completed that showed LVEF 50-55%, mild aortic stenosis, mild mitral reguritation and moderate 3+ tricuspid regurgitation, and severe pulmonary systolic hypertension. Due to suspicion for possible endocarditis in the setting of 3+ TR and MSSA bacteremia, a TEE was completed which did not show any valvular vegetations and his pacemaker was free of thrombus. After the above workup was complete, the most likely source for his bacteremia was his previous IV sites\/venopuncture sites on his forearms that initially appeared erythematous, indurated, and were tender. Since antibiotics, these lesions have improved. . The patient continued on the Nafcillin until ___ when it was noted by the following ID team that the patient's serum eosinophils and creatinine were elevated raising concern for possible acute interstial nephritis secondary to nafcillin. He was switched to Cefazolin the evening of ___. The morning of discharge his serum eosinophils decreased and his creatine was trending down. He will be continued on Cefazolin for 8 additional days, ending on ___. . The patients acute on chronic renal failure more likely is attributed to volume depletion with a dry appearing physical exam, mild hyponatremia and FeNa 0.4%. He received 250 cc boluses for 2 consecutive days, and one 500 cc bolus the day before discharge with improvement of his creatinine. His Lasix was stopped with the onset of bactermia and was held for the remainder of his admission. His Bumex was held since admission. His Creatinine will need to be monitored daily, and once it returns to normal, would consider restarting his Bumex. His trandalopril was also held due to low\/normal blood pressures and increase in creatinine. He may not require restarting this medication considering normal EF and normotension. . Note that the patient had witnessed aspiration and was evaluated by speech and swallow with a video swallow study. He is at mild risk of aspiration. They suggest soft solids, thin liquids with single sips and pills with puree. . The patient's pleural effusion was likely due to a combination of mild aspiration and initial fluid overload\/ acute CHF exacerbation. . The patient's anemia was worked up and found to be a combination of iron deficiency and B12 deficiency, he was started on both iron and oral B12. He was seen by the nutrition team who provided suggestions for better iron and B12 intake. . The patient has a history of hyperthyroidism with an elevated free T4 and undetectable TSH upon admission. His outpatient endocrinologist was called who suggested increasing his methimazole from 10mg to 30mg daily. The patient refused 30mg daily, instead he was willing to take 20mg daily. We recommend follow up and rechecking TSH\/T4 in 6 weeks post discharge. . The patient's other medical problems including DM2, hypertension, hyperlipidemia were all medically managed without complications. He developed likely penile candidiasis and was started on meconazole powder with relief. He had 2 episodes of loose stools after starting antibiotics, but was negative for Cdiff, EColi, Salmonella, Shigella. He later had hard stools. He was started on a bowel regimen as needed. .

{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: Ms. ___ is a ___ woman with a history of dementia who was admitted for work-up of an acute deterioration in mental status, including incomprehensible speech, confusion, agitation, and staring spells. After gradual worsening of her mental status over the course of one day, her family became concerned and she was brought to the ___ Emergency Department via ambulance at around midnight on ___. On initial mental status exam, she was found to be awake, alert, and able to follow simple commands, but oriented only to city, inattentive, tangential, restless, and unable to give a history. Her speech was fluent but occasionally slurred and unintelligible or containing phonemic errors. No focal neurologic deficits were identified on the remainder of the exam, although the exam was limited by the patient's ability to follow commands. General physical exam was unremarkable. Initial labs and chest x-ray were unremarkable. Non-contrast head CT revealed diffuse atrophy but no cute intracranial process. On review of medications, had been on a stable low dose of Xanax (0.25 MG TID) for years, which she did not take for 2 days prior to presentation, possibly due to her confusion. As no infectious or toxic-metabolic triggers for her altered mental status could be identified on initial work-up in the ED, she was admitted to the Stroke Service in order to work up possible neurological etiologies of her altered mental status, such as stroke or seizure. Her home meds, including Xanax, were resumed. During the day on ___, on exam she was more somnolent, opening her eyes to loud voice, did not produce much speech, and did not follow simple commands. She continuously reached out to grab at blankets or the examiner. An EEG showed signs of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, with generalized theta and delta slowing of the background activity but no epileptiform discharges or seizures. TSH and folate levels were normal, vitamin B12 level was borderline low but within normal limits at 314. MRI showed extensive chronic white matter ischemic change and at least moderate global atrophy, but no intracranial hemorrhage or acute infarction. Head and neck MRA were normal. Work-up for stroke risk factors (HbA1c, lipids, etc.) was unrevealing. There were no acute events overnight ___. On the morning of ___, her mental status exam was improved from the previous day. She was awake, alert, oriented to self, speaking with fluent and comprehensible speech, following commands, and no longer displayed motor agitation. On bedside swallow evaluation she showed aspiration across all liquid consistencies, and consequently was made NPO and started on maintenance IV fluids. Overnight from ___, she had a short episode of tachycardia to 113 and some low grade fevers in the early morning, to a maximum temperature of 100.6. She was given a bolus of 500 cc of normal saline. She had no complaints of dyspnea. On exam she was well-appearing without respiratory distress, and her mental status exam was further improved, with increased alertness and orientation to both self and the hospital setting. Chest x-ray showed no evidence of pneumonia and CBC showed normal WBC count, but given her aspiration on bedside swallow and low-grade fevers, empiric broad spectrum antibiotic coverage with vancomycin and Unasyn was initiated. Through the rest of the day she remained well-appearing and afebrile with stable vital signs and mental status. In the afternoon, she spiked a fever to 102.8, that resolved the next morning. Her mental status continued to improve, and is now baseline. Medicine consult determined that her syndrome was most likely viral, and that antibiotics could be stopped. If she does show recurring signs of infection, they recommended a 5 day course of Levaquin. Flu and viral URI swabs were obtained.","summary":"Your mother, ___, was admitted to ___ for difficult to understand speech, confusion, and agitation. These symptoms were thought to be due to DELIRIUM, a brain disorder that causes people to be confused. People with delirium often have trouble paying attention, switching attention from one thing to another, memory, language, or other thinking problems, trouble knowing where they are, when it is, or who the people around them are. People with delirium are usually very sleepy or hard to wake up. They can also be overly active or upset, or see or hear things that aren't really there.

A RUQ ultrasound with 7mm CBD with gallbladder distention was noted. A KUB demonstrated a non specific bowel gas pattern. He was then transferred to ___ for further evaluation. He notes vomiting of bilious material. He had been unable to tolerate any PO. ___ year old man with a history of hypertension and gout who presented with upper abdominal pain for 2 days prior to admission most likely due to gallstone pancreatitis leading to cholangitis. # CHOLANGITIS, # ACUTE PANCREATITIS LIKELY DUE TO CHOLEDOCOLITHIASIS: Patient presented initially to ___ with abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. He was found to have a lipase >3000, AST 215, ALT 102, ALP 323, Tbili 2.1. RUQ ultrasound was notable for 7mm CBD with gallbladder distention. Given concern for gallstone pancreatitis, he was transferred to ___ for ERCP. ERCP was attempted, however there was severe duodenitis making the procedure technically difficult. He was placed on bowel rest to reattempt the procedure in a few days. During that time he was started on ciprofloxacin to reduce the risk of developing infection. However, he had fevers, hypotension and worsening hyperbilirubinemia, likely due to developing cholangitis. His creatinine also increased from 0.6 to 1.5, likely due to ATN in the setting of hypotension. Antibiotics were broadened to Zosyn. The following morning he was brought for repeat ERCP, this time with successful stenting of the CBD with drainage of bile and pus. His symptoms quickly improved, along with improvement in all of his laboratory values. He was weaned to ciprofloxacin to complete a 7 day course. His diet was advanced and he was tolerating a regular diet at the time of discharge. He will follow up in ___ weeks for stent removal. He was also seen by the surgical service during this admission with recommendation for outpatient follow up to consider cholecystectomy after recovery from this current episode. # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: Creatinine increased to 1.5 from baseline 0.6. Urine lytes were notable for a FeNa <0.1, however did not improve with aggressive volume repletion. Muddy brown casts were seen in the urine sediment, making ATN the likely cause of his renal failure. The most likely cause of ATN in this case would be hypotension in the setting of cholangitis. Nephrotoxic medications were held and medications were renally dosed. The patient's renal function recovered with a creatinine of 1.0 on the day of discharge. # ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE: Per patient's family he is alcohol dependent. However, he did not require any diazepam during this admission and his CIWA scores were below 10. Alcohol cessation was advised. # DM2: Oral hypoglycemics were held during this admission. He was monitored using an insulin sliding scale. # ESSENTIAL HYPERTENSION: Patient's blood pressure was quite elevated in the setting of severe pain initially and his home medications had been continued. However, in the setting of cholangitis he became hypotensive to the ___ and had an increase in creatinine from 0.6 to 1.5. His antihypertensives were held at that time. His blood pressure increased to 140s\/80s so atenolol was restarted. Given that his systolic blood pressure remained in 120s for the two days prior to discharge, he was not restarted on amlodipine, furosemide or losartan. He was given clear instructions to check his blood pressure at home and to notify his PCP if it were to become more elevated (or too low). The patient expressed understanding of this plan. He will be scheduled to see his PCP for ___ blood pressure and lab check and they can resume medications as indicated at that time. # GOUT: Continued allopurinol. # SYSTOLIC MURMUR: Per patient, this is an old finding. No cardiac symptoms, but recommend outpatient TTE if this is actually a new finding or change from prior. TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: [ ] All of patient's antihypertensives except atenolol were held due to hypotension. He was clinically stable with blood pressures in the 120s\/70s for the 2 days prior to discharge, so they were not restarted. Please check his blood pressure at the next visit and restart medications as indicated. [ ] Patient needs to have biliary stent removed in ___ weeks by ERCP.

His vital signs remained stable with the exception of intermittent elevated heart rate as described below (see Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation\/supraventricular tacyhcardia below). His chest pain was most likely secondary to stable angina or demand secondary to SVT. It could also be related to his pneumonia (discussed below). 2) ___ In the emergency department, a chest x-ray showed a retrocardiac opacity with small bilateral pleural effusions. His WBC count was 8.1 with 84.6% neutrophils. He remained afebrile during his admission. On ___, he was started on a 10-day course of levofloxacin and vancomycin to treat hospital acquired pneumonia (as his presumed infection was likely acquired at his assisted living facility). A PICC was placed. Upon discharge, he will require an additional 5 days of therapy: Levofloxacin 750 mg PO QOD and Vancomycin 1250 mg IV QD. 3) Supraventricular tachycardia\/paroxysmal atrial fibrillation Upon arrival to the floor, the patient had a brief episode of atrial fibrillation in the context of agitation. His heart rate elevated to 160s without hemodynamic instability. The rhythm converted to sinus rhythm following administration of metoprolol 5mg IV push x2. The patient has had transient episodes of nonsustained SVT throughout the hospital course that decreased in frequency. Repeat EKG during episodes was not consistent with PAF, but rather SVT with presence of p-waves. Etiology is unclear, and patient maintained hemodynamic stability during episodes. A possible precipitant is his underlying pneumonia. CHADS2 = ___ (unclear if he has had a stroke in the past). To investigate possible causes of his atrial fibrillation, TSH was checked; it was mildly elevated, as described below (Follow up). TTE showed mild left atrial enlargement with ___ MR. ___ 50-55%. 4) Renal failure The patient's creatinine level was maintained at or below his baseline of 1.6-1.8. The levofloxacin and vancomycin (administered as above) were renally dosed. Lasix was held through most of admission, and restarted on discharge. 5) Code status DNR as documented in that patient's chart and confirmed with the patient's health care proxy ___ (___). The patient is not DNI. In the event that the patient requires intubation, Mr. ___ would appreciate being consulted first if that is possible. 6) Follow up - Please administer his prescribed medications. His levofloxacin is dosed every other day; he received his last dose on ___ and is due for his next dose on ___. - Please remove PICC after last dose of vancomycin (which should be administered ___. - Please check a creatinine level in 3 days. This is to ensure that his creatinine remains within his baseline range of 1.6-1-8. - Please check thyroid fuction tests in 6 weeks. This is to further assess elevated TSH (4.9) during this admission. - The patient will need a repeat chest x-ray in ___ weeks to check for resolution of pneumonia.","summary":"You were admitted with chest pain.

{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: Mr. ___ is a ___ y.o. man with Stage IV COPD CAD s\/p CABG, CHF admitted to OSH with COPD flare, his course was complicated by hypercarbic respiratory failure and lower extremity paralysis with cord compression and paraspinal abscess now ___ s\/p surgical debridement and fusion, course complicated by transient episodes of complete AV block, poor systolic function, respiratory failure x 2 requiring intubation, and hypotension requiring pressors. His respiratory failure has resolved, his hypotension is resolved on midodrine, but he has persistent ___ paralysis secondary to paraspinal abscess\/cord compression. Active Issues #)Respiratory failure: Per OSH, pt had COPD exacerbation leading to hypercarbic respiratory failure and intubation and uneventful extubation. He did experience dyspnea ___ excess secretions and atelectasis. Required ipratopium and saline nebs. He was extubated and did well enough to transfer from the MICU to the floor. However, he began having respiratory distress and poor blood gases necessitating transfer back to the MICU, where he was intubated and put on pressure support. He became hypotensive and tachycardic in this setting, likely b\/c he was put on pressure support b\/c of concern for an ARDS picture. He was switched to CMV, and his hypotension became less profound, and his respiratory status improved. He was able to have sedation reduced the ___ day of his intubation (___). On ___, he was able to have a successful spontaneous breathing trial, a RSBI 45, had O2 sats in the ___, and was arousable but not able to clear secretions. He did well on CPAP, but extubation was held off due to his inability to clear secretions. On ___ he became more alert, again passed an SBT, and had a RSBI<100. He was given a trial of extubation since he was felt to be about as good as he will be re: mental status. He passed this trial and was able to be weaned down to 4L NC over the next few days w\/o having acute respiratory distress. Oxygen should be weaned as tolerated for goal sat >90%. # Hypotension: This is the result of multifactorial processes: poor systolic function + neurogenic hypotension + sepsis + sedation. Also has baseline orthostatic hypotension for which he was on fludrocortisone prior to admission. During his initial MICU stay, he required IVF and pressor support and was successfully weaned off after he was restarted on fludrocortisone at an increased dose of daily instead of every other day. However, he again became hypotensive in the setting of pressure-support ventilation and an NSTEMI. He maxed out on levophed and was placed on phenylephrine as well. When his ventilator settings were changed to CMV, he was able to be weaned off levophed althoug he remained on phenylephrine even after his MAP titration floor was changed to <55. He also had elevated troponins and was diagnosed w\/ an NSTEMI in this repeat setting of hypotension, so the NSTEMI may have contributed to his hypotension by worsening his systolic function, although his LVEF remained at 35% on f\/u Echo. He was able to be weaned off phenylephrine after extubation and was transitioned to PO midodrine for blood pressure support. He has follow-up with his cardiologist ___. # Epidural abscess and T9 osteomyelitis s\/p debridement and fusion: Pt presented with cord compression and lower extremity flaccid paralysis ___ epidural abscess and osteomyelitis. After surgical debridement ___, he was empirically covered with vancomycin and ceftriaxone and flagyl. Epidural abscess cultures revealed Gram+ cocci. Likely source was sacral decubitus ulcer. ID on board and advised to continue vancomycin for 6 weeks since the tissue grew Strep viridans but after sensitivities returned changed the antibiotic to ceftriaxone. Antibiotics should continue until ___. He will follow-up with Dr. ___ ___ of orthopedics in ~4weeks and will follow up at ___ clinic as well. Weekly labs should be faxed to infectious disease RNs with ESR, CRP and CBC\/diff checked weekly. #NSTEMI: In the setting of his hypotension upon his second transfer to the MICU on ___, he was found to have elevated troponins for which he was started on heparin gtt, atorvastatin 80 mg, and ASA 325 for NSTEMI. His troponins trended down ___, so heparin gtt was discontinued. A TTE, which was poor quality, was performed ___ which revealed LVEF 35%, moderate LV dilated systolic dysfunction hypokinesis w\/ distal ___ of ventricle having hypokinesis, nl R chamber, no AR\/MR, and no effusions. A subsequent TEE was similar to the TTE. He was started on clopidogrel 75 mg PO daily as well in this setting after being cleared by ortho to do so. He has follow-up with his cardiologist Dr. ___ on ___, at this appointment anticoagulation for LV aneurysm should be considered but was deferred during hospitalization given comorbidities and recent surgery. #Complete AV Block \/ Tachycardia-Bradycardia syndrome: Pt had 2 episodes of bradycardia with complete AV block which required atropine and pressors to break during initial MICU stay. Per cardiology and EP, a pacemaker is likely to be required after his acute osteomyelitis has resolved and antibiotics course completed. AV nodal blocking drugs have been held. Given continued concern for possible cardiac vegetations or complication such as abscess, a TEE was performed ___, which revealed no cardiac vegetations or clinically significant valvular disease. He has follow-up with his cardiologist Dr. ___ on ___ at which time a pacemaker should be considered. #Renal Failure: His baseline Cr 1.0. He developed renal failure where his Cr doubled to 2.2 from ___ to ___ following his episode of hypotension and NSTEMI, so this was likely pre-renal in nature. His Cr stayed around 2.0 a week after this event, so this may be his new baseline. Cr on discharge 1.9 #Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation: Patient was not on anticoagulation prior to admission and given setting of recent surgery was not started while in MICU. Should follow up on this issue at his cardiology visit. #Delirium: On the ___ MICU admission, he exhibited waxing and waning mental status with some agitation before transfer to the general floor. Seroquel 25 mg x 2 was given without benefit. He received Haldol 1mg IM, which improved without significant increase in QTC. On the ___ MICU admission, he was started on seroquel 25 mg TID to help address his agitation. He did require haldol 6 mg IV during his second MICU stay due to acute agitation. On discharge he was confused but not agitated and continued on seroquel 25 mg TID. The need for continued antipsychotics should be reassessed after discharge to extended care. # Sacral Decubitus Ulcer: This was an issue which the ACS service was monitoring. This ulcer has not been improving per nursing, wound care, and ACS. Santyl (collagenase) enzymatic debridement was started to help address this. Chronic Issues #Pulmonary HTN: Stable, not on medications for this and was continued on supplmental O2. # Chronic systolic heart failure: EF 35% per report from ___. Lasix was originally held in the setting of hypotension, but this was restarted since Mr. ___ was several liters positive during the hospitalization. His metoprolol was held throughout his hospitalization given his complete heart block. He was discharged on lasix 80 mg in AM and 40 mg in ___ which was his home regimen, but volume status should be reassessed and dose may be increased if patient gains more than 3 lbs in one day or concern for hypervolemia. # CAD: 4-Vessel CABG in ___ at ___.

Gout Flair: The patient states that the wrist pain has been present for 4 days, and it feels similar to her previous flares of gout. She was seen by orthopedic surgery in the ED, and she had a wrist XRay, which was negative. She was afebrile and did not have a leukocytosis, her uric acid was elevated at 12.8, and she had a previously confirmed episode of gout, so gout flair was thought to be the most likely etiology. She was initially started on colchicine, as indomethacin was contraindicated given her acute on chronic renal failure, but her pain did not improve. She then developed right ankle pain, so Rheumatology was consulted, and she was started on Prednisone. She should continue on Colchicine daily and Prednisone for an eight day taper. Furthermore, she was scheduled to see Dr. ___ in Rheumatology for follow-up in one week. # Hematuria: The patient reports gross hematuria, which started three days prior to admission. She denied dysuria, flank pain, or CVA tenderness, and a straight-cath U\/A confirmed gross hematuria. Her U\/A did not show evidence of RBC casts, and renal U\/S was negative for any obvious massess in the kidney.

ACTIVE ISSUES: # ___: Unclear etiology. Possibly related to pre-exisiting cryoglobulinemia or vasculitis however urine protein inconsistent with MPGN. Patient responded to lasix and given hyponatremia, may be prerenal picture. Although patient's MELD 24, driven by creatinine (falsely elevated). Synthetic function good making HRS less likely etiology. Patient continued on lasix 120 mg BID with goal of ___ L\/day out. Renal ultrasound showed no evidence of hydronephrosis and a small amount of ascites. Ultimately patient's diuresis to Lasix and Metolazone was minimal. A tunneled HD line was placed and patient began HD (with the goal of 2L fluid removal daily). He tolerated this well. An ECHO showed over all preserved biventricular function so heart failure was not thought to be a contributing factor. The patient was on a long Prednisone taper for his cryoglobulinemia and on 40mg was not showing improving renal function and was having uncontrollable hyperglycemia. He was tapered down to Prednisone 20mg daily which he tolerated well. Renal team recommended re-initiation of diuretics while patient was on HD as he was still having urine output so started Torsemide 80mg daily. He will continue on a ___ HD schedule as an outpatient. # Right forearm pain: Patient initially mentioned some right forearm pain in setting of pulling himself up in the bed, attributing it to muscle strain. His exam was overall benign when the pain was first noticed. He had a CK that was normal. Patient continued to complain of severe pain, out of proportion to exam which was minimally controlled with Oxycodone and Tylenol. He had plain films that showed no fracture and no osteoporosis. He underwent an U\/S to rule out DVT. By U\/S a small thrombosed superficial vein was noted but no DVT. His exam progressed to have soft tissue swelling around the elbow and forearm as well as warmth. There was some mild erythema noted but given his baseline skin breakdown and ecchymoses, it was difficult to differentiate. He had MRI which showed findings concerning for myonecrosis and deep tissue infection. Orthopedic surgery was consulted as was Rheumatology and Infectious disease. Considered the possibility that patient had cryoglobulins contributing to the myonecrosis but Rheumatology thought very unlikely. They also considered diabetic myonectoris unlikely as well. Orthopedic surgery did not see any indication for intervention at time of consult. Patient was started on broad spectrum antibiotics (Vanc, Zosyn and Clindamyin) and blood cultures were drawn. Given rapid progression of his symptoms further imaging was performed. MRI revealed evidence of myonecrosis. CT scan was negative for gas formation or abscess. His exam was monitored closely and improved with antibiotics. Despite counseling regarding the need to monitor his symptoms and exam on PO antibiotics prior to discharge home, he did not want to stay in-house beyond ___. He received 2 days of IV antibiotics and is discharged on Bactrim and Keflex. He will take Keflex to complete a ___nd will continue to take Bactrim for PCP prophylaxis as below. #AMS: Patient had poor concentration on presentation. Head CT was negative. Hepatic encephalopathy unlikely given that patient's synthetic function was okay. Patient was continued on lactulose and rifaximin for possible hepatic encephalopathy. Mental status for duration of hospitalization was largely at baseline though patient experienced significant fatigue with initiation of HD and pain medications for above issue. # Cirrhosis: Child ___ class B, due to hepatitis C (gen. 1b) s\/p failed treatment with IFN. Given multiple complications related to cryoglobulinemia attempted to initiate sofosbuvir and simeprivir however denied by insurance on multiple attempts. Decompensated with hepatic encephalopathy and ascites, no report of bleeding varices or SBP in the past. MELD currently 21 but falsely elevated due to creatine. Patient should get EGD as outpatient. Patient's U\/S on admission showed normal liver and patent hepatic vasculature, splenomegaly, and Small ascites. # Cryoglobulinemia: Complications include leukocytoclastic vasculitis, CKD as above, and pulmonary hemorrhage (___) treated with high dose steroids and plasmapharesis in the past though had seizure on plasmaphereisis. He was continued on a prednisone taper and at discharge was on 20mg daily to continue long taper per his outpatient nephrologist. He is discharged on Bactrim for PCP prophylaxis and ___ continue taking this until he completes the prednisone taper per his outpatient nephrologist. # Diabetes: During this admission he had uncontrolled hyperglycemia with blood sugars to >500 and a widening anion gap.

Active Issues: . #Pre-syncope: Differential diagnosis of his presyncopal event includes vasovagal, cardiogenic, orthostatic, or drug effect. Patient endorsed prodrome of lightheadedness, diaphoresis, pallor that occurred over minutes that supports vasovagal syncope. This was likely exacerbated by his recent alcohol use (serum tox level was 51 on admission)and he was possibly somewhat volume depleted given his ketonuria. Initial physical exam showed diaphoresis, tremulousness, and cerebellar signs consistent with alcohol intoxication\/early withdrawal. ___ in ED was WNL, so hypoglycemia was unlikely contributing factor. Had a similar, but less severe episode ont he commuter rail 2 weeks ago, also after a weekend of drinking EtOH. His episode did not occur after rising to standing position so unlikely to be orthostatic syncope. Cardiogenic syncope (arrhythmia, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy) was considered less likely given that he did not lose consiousness suddenly and did not have a true LOC. He underwent an ECG which showed normal sinus rhythm with left axis deviation as well as left ventricular hypertrophy and was placed on telemetry which demonstrated no electrical abnormalities. There was no evidence on history or physical exam to suggest seizure or TIA as cause. . #EtOH Abuse\/Tobacco use: Patient reported drinking ___ cups of vodka daily for the past ___s having recent alcohol use with serum tox positive for alcohol on admission. Therefore, there was concern for withdrawal and he was placed on a CIWA scale, although did not require any diazepam and manifested only mild tremulousness. He was started on folic acid 1 mg QD and thiamine 100 mg QD daily and will be discharged on these as well. He was also placed on a nicotine patch given his significant tobacco use and supplied with prescriptions for nicotine patch and gum. . #Gait disturbance: Patient describes feeling unsteady on his feet, particularly in shower and when he closes his eyes that has developed slowly over past year. His neuro exam was notable for proprioceptive loss in b\/l toes, and wide-based gait with short steps, with an inability to tandem walk which was consistent with a sensory ataxia (disturbance of the dorsal columns or of peripheral nerves). This was thought to be secondary to a direct toxic alcoholic peripheral neuropathy complicated by concurrent nutritional deficiencies, although vitamin B12 level was normal. He was started on thiamine and informed that his alcohol use was the likely cause. . #Hypertension: Patient was found to be hypertensive (max 177\/100) while in house and was started on chlorthalidone prior to discharge. He will need follow-up with PCP in next few days to address his blood pressure response. .

{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: ___ year old male with diabetes, chronic kidney disease, atrial fibrillation on warfarin presents with acute on chronic renal failure and associated electrolyte and metabolic abnormalities, admitted to the ICU for further management. ACTIVE ISSUES ------------- # Shock: Developed during early part of hospitalization. Etiologies considered were cardiogenic, septic, and neurogenic. Most likely etiology septic based on improvement with broad spectrum antibiotics. Required three pressors (norepinephrine, phenylepherine, and vasopressin) for maintenance of MAPs>60mmHg. These were down-titrated as tolerated. The patient was also fluid resuscitated with boluses of NS. He was empirically started on vancomycin, cefepime, and metronidazole, and eventually transitioned to meropenem secondary to persistence of leukocytosis and fevers. Antibiotics were discontinued on ___. Culture data was all negative. Echocardiogram revealed normal ventricular function. Patient continued to be afebrile and without leukocytosis throughout the remainder of his hospital course. # Respiratory failure: Patient was electively intubated for worsening metabolic abnormalities. Mechanical ventilation was weaned as tolerated and he was extubated on ___. Following extubation, the patient was weaned to room air, but later on in his hospital course, he developed a new oxygen requirement. Furosemide trial was attempted, and incentive spirometry was encouraged. Patient was satting at92% RA on day of discharge and no longer had a demand for oxygen. # Hyperkalemia: Likely elevated in the setting of renal failure. Had questionable peaked T-waves in the ED. He received treatment with D50, insulin, and albuterol at OSH with persistently elevated potassium. He also received kayexelate, calcium gluconate, D50, insulin in fluids in the ___ ED. Due to persistent metabolic abnormalities, he was started on CVVH. His potassium improved and normalized with return of his kidney function. # Acute on chronic kidney injury: Patient with elevated creatinine in the acute setting. FeNa of 1% which is equivocal for prerenal vs ATN. Nephrotoxic medications were avoided and his medications were renally dosed. He was started on CVVH as above and nephrology recommendations were followed. Ultimately, his kidney function improved and he did not require any renal replacement therapy. Cr at the time of discharge was 1.5. # Atrial fibrillation: CHADS score of 3. Required cardioversion several times secondary to hypotension and RVR with HR to the 160s. An amiodarone drip was initiated but aborted ___ after no improvement in heart rate. He was also refractory to diltiazem gtt and esmolol gtt. This likely was exacerbated by metabolic derangements, refractory shock, and atrial stretch from hypervolemia. He was digoxin loaded ___ and this was continued during his hospitalization. Amiodarone was restarted ___. As pressors were weaned off and blood pressure stabilized, metoprolol was intiated with improvement in his heart rate. Further, he was reinitiated on an amiodarone drip for loading for a total of ten grams. His anticoagulation originally was held secondary to supratherapeutic levels. It was not reinitiated at the time of call out from the MICU. Cardiology recommended call out to the cardiology service for further management. Once on the cardiology service, the patient continued to be in atrial fibrillation, with rates into 100-120s. Patient was initially maintained on digoxin and metoprolol, but was not well rate controlled. Diltiazem was added, but heart rates continued to be elevated. This lack of response to oral medications was thought to be due to malabsoption in the setting of large-volume diarrhea discussed below. As such, efforts were made to better control the diarrhea, and as his bowels slowed, heart rates became better controlled. Patient's warfarin was restarted on ___ when his INR came back down to 2.7. It was initiated at a dose of 2.5 mg. Patient's INR will need to be rechecked on ___. # Diarrhea: At baseline the patient has a protuberant abdomen. Clinically, there was a concern for intraabdominal process contributing to his refractory shock. His stool cultures, including C. diff PCR, were negative. He had a Flexiseal placed for rectal decompression. He continued to have diarrhea that was believed to be non-infectious and related to bowel loss of his normal gut flora. He was started on loperamide and tincture of opium while in the MICU. Once the floor, the patient was given cholestyramine in addition to loperamide with eventual improvement in his diarrhea. # Anemia: Patient with baseline hematocrit in ___. This has been downtrending since admission. Patient has had guaiac positive stools this admission, but no overt melena. Guaiac positive stools were not unexpected in the setting of large volume diarrhea. Iron studies were consistent with anemia of chronic disease. On ___, the patient was experiencing some bright blood mixed with stool, likely from active hemorrhoids. Hematocrit was stable between ___, and he was not orthostatic. He will need daily hematocrit checks and hemorrhoid care. # Citrate administration: Iatrogenic administration into systemic circulation. Discovered in the ___ of ___ with toxicology consulted for recommendations. Calcium was checked q2hrs for monitoring of hypocalcemia with calcium gluconate for repletion. Adverse side effects of citrate toxicity include hypocalcemia and QTc prolongation. Ionized Ca++ was monitored and was maintained >1 with calcium gluconate administration. Per toxicology, likely cleared from system over 24hrs. Never experienced QTc prolongation. # Metabolic acidosis: Likely secondary to renal failure and inability to clear hydrogen ions. Lactic acid normal. Patient received bicarbonate in the ED. Improved with management and resolution of shock. # Toxic metabolic encephalopathy: Following extubation the patient's mental status waxed and waned. This continued for a majority of his hospital stay. The cause was thought to be secondary to many of the metabolic derangements discussed above as well as disturbances in sleep\/wake cycles. As the ___ hospital course became more stable, his mental status improved as well. # Hyperphosphatemia: Elevated on admission likely in the setting of renal failure. Improved with CVVH and return of renal function. INACTIVE ISSUES --------------- # Diabetes mellitus: Blood glucose monitored and managed with insulin sliding scale. # Hypertension: Anti-hypertensives initially were held secondary to triple pressor requirement. They were restarted as tolerated. # Hyperlipidemia: On simvastatin TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: -------------------- - 7 mm right middle lobe lung nodule.

During your stay you required a number of different antibiotics to help eliminate a suspected infection. You were also found to be in an abnormal heart rhythm, called atrial fibrillation. Due to this abnormal heart rhythm and your infection, your blood pressures dropped and you needed special medications to help you maintain a good blood pressure. In order to help you breathe, you needed to be intubated and you also required a form of dialysis to help remove fluid from your lungs.

Less likely PNA (normal WBC, no cough, fever), CHF (normal BNP), PE (normal D-dimer). The leading causes were sufficiently investigated via TTE (with bubble), RHC, CT, VQ Scan. Mild worsening of pulmonary artery hypertension was observed on right heart catheterization and cardiac output improved with vasodilating agent. Findings were not enough to explain degree of dyspnea. Ambulation on day prior to discharge after warming hands under hot water showed a good pleth and that she was in fact not hypoxic with ambulation. The low oximtery values that had motivated the workup up of dyspnea on exertion were then thought to be spurious findings, related to her Raynaud's symptoms. With this in mind, her dyspnea was thought to be secondary to chronic reconditioning. # Sjo___'s syndrome: The patient has chronic sicca symptoms. Cyclosporine eye drops were non formulary so will need to discuss with pharmacy in the morning regarding alternative or whether patient may take her own meds.

She was initially acutely encephalopathic during the admission but subsequently made some improvement. However per her daughter she appeared to remain below her baseline. However, given persistence and unchanging nature of her confusion (disoriented to place, but otherwise alert and interactive), this is likely an underlying undiagnosed cognitive impairment that was exacerbated by hospitalization for her fall. She was treated for suspected UTI for 2 days with Ceftriaxone prior to a negative culture result. Her B12 and TSH were normal, RPR was negative. Mental status improved significantly from admission, but she remained only oriented to person and time. ___ re-evaluation suggested that patient may be more likely suitable for placement in ___ rehab. Ultimately, for her safety, she may either need more intense home supervision or placement in a nursing home. Her home Nortriptyline was restarted at a low dose (20mg at bedtime) for insomnia\/depression. Her home Clonazepam was held, due to the possibility of worsening confusion\/sedation (BEER's List medicine). Outpatient neurocognitive testing is recommended. # UTI: Persistent UA with leuks and WBCs. Patient did not have urinary symptoms, but given AMS she received 2 doses CTX 1g q24h.

{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: ___ with h\/o systolic CHF (EF 35-40%), CKD (Cr 2.2), afib on coumadin who p\/w weakness, cough, and diarrhea with dense retrocardiac opacity seen on CXR concerning for infection\/aspiration. # Cough, Leukocytosis: Initially there was concern that the patient had developed a pneumonia. She had been treated with amoxicillin-clavulanate as an outpatient prior to admission without improvement. She was treated here with 7 days of levofloxacin (___) without much improvement of respiratory symptoms in the setting of concurrent diuresis for CHF. She slowly improved with reduced oxygen requirement, reduced leukocytosis, and smaller opacity on repeat CXR ___. There was no evidence of aspiration on speech and swallowing evaluation ___. Legionella Ag was negative. Given the ongoing cough and possibility that the chest XR retrocardiac opacity was not a bacterial PNA, she was then treated supportively as though she were recovering from an acute viral bronchitis given her ongoing wet cough and mild hypoxemia. She achieved euvolemia on exam after diuresis and had persistent cough. Chest ___, schedule ipratropium nebs, flutter valve, and cough suppressants were given. CT chest on ___ showed findings concerning for acute on chronic aspiration so she was put on aspiration precautions. Pulmonology consult recommended no antibiotics for her consolidation on CT, but rather to pursue aggressive pulmonary hygiene with flutter valve, chest ___, hypertonic saline nebs. On discharge she was tolerating room air with Sa02 ~95%. Her WBC count was still slightly elevated at ___, but had been stable for days, and was thought to reflect ongoing aspiration pneumonitis. She requires ongoing chest ___, work with flutter valve and incentive spirometry at rehab. She was placed on dysphagia diet with aspiration precautions. She was empirically started on a PPI for GERD in case this was contributing to cough. # Atrial fibrillation: On coumadin for CHADS 2. INR initially supratherapeutic and warfarin held for 2 days, then restarted. The patient's baseline rhythm is AF, normally rate controlled with metoprolol. ___ AM she had brief period of HR 110s requiring extra dose metoprolol 12.5mg PO. Overnight ___F. Received metoprolol 37.5mg PO, 5mg IV. Became hypotensive to SBP 79 briefly, stayed in the 80-85 range for several hours despite 250cc bolus x2. MICU consult called given concern for hypotension. The patient continued to mentate well, tolerated lower BP well (baseline low ___. No transfer to MICU, SBP slowly came up to ___ with HR 100-115. Most likely her volume overload has led to increased atrial stretch and drive to RVR; albuterol may also be a component given sympathetic stimulation. Albuterol was discontinued. Given concern that her CHF and borderline hypotension may be secondary to lack of atrial kick, it was elected to DC cardiovert the patient ___ after starting amiodarone ___. She was successfully cardioverted and remained in sinus rhythm at discharge. She was continued on warfarin given the unknown durability of cardioversion in her. She should have outpatient TSH and LFTs for ongoing amiodarone and will require dose adjustment as outpatient in the future after initial loading # Chronic Systolic & Diastolic CHF: Her dCHF is secondary to hypertension, and her systolic component is likely ischemic. TTE ___ showed newly depressed EF with RV dilatation and WMA. Presented with elevated BNP although weight of 71.9 kg on admission below last discharge weight (74kg). No obvious signs of pulmonary edema or lower extremity swelling, although per prior records the patient frequently does not display these signs. Diuretics held ___ given poor PO intake and concern for infection but diuresis then started when BPs stable. There was difficulty being aggressive because of her borderline hypotension to the high ___ and ___. She was eventually diuresed to what was thoguht to be roughly her dry weight of 74kg (corresponds to last hospitalization). She was discharged on metoprolol XL 50mg daily. She did not have sufficient room in her blood pressure to start and ACEI, especially after amiodarone was begun. She was continued on ASA 81mg, metoprolol succinate 50mg daily, and simvastatin 20mg daily. # Diarrhea: Loose stools for 3 days (___). Noted to have brown guaiac positive stool. C diff and other stool studies negative. Started loperamide for symptomatic relief. # E coli bacteriuria vs CA-UTI: She was treated for a CA-UTI given that urine culture from a Foley sample was positive. The E coli was fluoroquinolone resistant. She was treated despite absent symptoms because she is an unreliable historian and her WBC was still elevated. She received 3days of IV ceftriaxone ___, followed by cefpodoxime daily ___. # CAD: Last hospitalization in ___ with evidence of depressed EF possible due to ischemic event. Cath deferred at that time. Patient currently without chest pain, EKG unchanged, would benefit from continued medical mgmt. She was continued on ASA 81mg, metoprolol succinate 50mg daily, and simvastatin 20mg daily. # CKD: Patient with stage III-IV CKD, Cr ranged between 2.0-2.8. Recent baseline around 2.3. Her allopurinol was reduced from 300mg daily to 100mg every other day because of her eGFR. # Hypothyroidism: Continued levothyroxine 50mcg. # Gout: Continued colchicine and allopurinol, but allopurinol was reduced from 300mg daily to 100mg every other day because of her eGFR. # Code: Full (discussed with patient) # Emergency Contact: ___, sister; ___ ___. ___ (son) ___ Transitional Issues: -she requires daily INR checks for several days post-discharge to ensure stable regimen -amiodarone was started at 400mg daily on ___, she will need to be loaded to 10 grams and then her dose may be decreased by her outpatient cardiologist -She requires outpatient check of her TSH and LFTs in a few weeks to make sure amiodarone is not causing side effects -pulmonary consultants recommended outpatient PFTs -She video swallow study and speech pathology evaluation to rule out aspiration.","summary":"You were admitted to the hospital with worsening cough and shortness of breath. We performed a chest xray that did not show any signs of worsening heart failure, however, it was concerning for a possible pneumonia. We treated the pneumonia with an antibiotic called levofloxacin. You continued to have cough and low blood oxygen, so we gave you diuretics in case some heart failure was causing fluid to build up on the lungs. We also cardioverted your heart from atrial fibrillation to normal sinus rhythm, which succesfully restored a normal heart rhythm but did not help with your cough. We started a medication called amiodarone to help keep your heart in a normal rhythm. We performed a CT scan of the chest which showed emphysema and inflammation likely from chronic aspiration. The pulmonary consult team saw you and recommended no further antibiotics for pneumonia, and to try to clear your lungs with chest physical therapy, nebulizers, and to make sure you weren't aspirating liquids when you swallow.

She did continue to have diarrhea. Most likely these symptoms represent a viral gastroenteritis. She was treated with intravenous fluids but continued to have abdominal pain and diarrhea. CT of the abdomen showed no acute process to explain pain. Diarrhea and pain decreased, and she was able to tolerate a full diet prior to discharge. # Elevated CK: Cardiac enzymes were checked at time of admission and CK noted to be elevated. CK noted to continue to trend up. Patient's statin stopped in case this was contributing. We felt that the elevated CK could be due to her viral illness. CK was downtrending at the time of discharge, and her primary care physician was contacted and agreed to follow it after discharge and potentially restart the statin. # Dizziness: Patient described dizziness as feeling as though she were on a boat. She denied any feeling of a spinning sensation. At time of admission patient reported that dizziness was much improved compared to the previous two weeks. It is possible that patient was experiencing vertigo, though the fact that these symptoms were constant makes vertigo less likely. Patient did describe more frequent palpitations over the past few weeks. She was noted to be in sinus rhythm during this hospital course. On telemetry she remained in sinus rhythm and had occasional PVCs but no evidence of pauses. She was not orthostatic and was noted by the nursing staff to be stable on her feet without objective evidence of weakness. # Supratherapeutic INR: Patient noted to have INR of 6 at time of admission.

{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: The following issues were addressed during this admission: <br> # Recurrent pneumonia <br> CXR on admission was consistent with L lower lobe pneumonia. She was also endorsing cough productive of green or bloody sputum as well as dyspnea. Given her risk factors for hospital-acquired pneumonia and MDR organisms, she was started on: CefePIME 2 g IV Q12H, Vancomycin 1000 mg IV Q 12H, Levofloxacin 500 mg PO\/NG Q24H. She was also started on Tamiflu, which was discontinued when influenza DFA came back negative. Blood cultures and sputum cultures were also sent. Interventional pulmonology was consulted regarding the utility of stenting given her recurrent infections and possible bronchomalacia. She underwent a bronchoscopy showing 98-100% collapse of her L mainstem bronchus. BAL and suction of LLL was performed and cultures were sent. No growth has been seen on blood or BAL cultures to date, and sputum culture grew only commensal organisms. The patient has been scheduled for rigid bronchoscopy with placement of a silicone Y-stent as an outpatient on ___. PFTs and a 6-min walk test were performed as a baseline for post-procedure comparison. She will follow up ___ weeks following stent placement to reassess pulmonary function and determine whether she is a candidate for permanent repair via tracheobronchoplasty with mesh placement. At discharge she was afebrile with no complaint of dyspnea and infrequent cough occasionally productive of yellow sputum. A PICC line was place prior to discharge for continuation of a 10 day course of Vancomycin and Cefepime as an outpatient. ___ follow up was arranged. . # Asthma: She was continued on her home asthma medications including albuterol, singulair, and advair. She was also given albuterol, ipratropium, and mucomyst nebulizers for symptomatic relief of her asthma. . # Anemia: No previous history of anemia per patient. Crits were stable this admission at around 35. Iron studies were sent and were all within normal limits. Reticulocyte count came back at 1.6 indicating some degree of marrow suppression. IV Ig products are known to induce hemolytic anemia, however her haptoglobin and LDH levels were also within normal limits. Her smear was abnormal with 2+ hypochromia, 2+ anisocytosis, 1+ poikilocytosis, 1+ macrocytosis, occasional microcytosis, occasional polychromasia, 1+ schistocytes, 1+ burr cells. As she has been taking many antibiotics over the past three months, several of which are known to cause anemia, and as it is possible she has had recent respiratory viral infections that could have resulted in some degree of marrow suppression, suggest outpatient follow up to reassess her anemia when not acutely ill or taking antibiotics. . # Chest pain: During ___ placement the patient reported the sudden onset of a \"fluttering\" in her chest and feeling like her heart was racing. She also reported mild chest pain that was positional and worsened when she was sitting up. The PICC line was pulled back 1cm with resolution of symptoms. CXR was then performed that showed PICC line tip located in SVC. EKG at the time showed mild STD in lateral leads. The same symptoms recurred several hours later, and a repeat EKG at that time was normal. Cardiac enzymes were negative x2. She was monitored on telemetry overnight. She was asymptomatic for the rest of the admission. This episode was thought to be due either to a transient arrhythmia induced by advancement of the PICC into the right heart, or due to tachycardia secondary to anxiety and albuterol tx. . # Yeast Infection: On hospital day one she reported symptoms of vaginal pruritis and burning consistent with prior yeast infections. She was given a one-time dose of fluconazole with resolution of her symptoms by the following day. . # Urinary frequency: On hosp day one, she reported increased urinary frequency and voiding only small amounts of urine with each attempt. UA was sent. UA showed few bacteria without elevated WBCs or hematuria.

He will follow-up with his cardiologist, Dr. ___ want to consider ablation in the future. . # Blood Pressure Control: The patient was intially borderline hypotensive, had orthostatic blood pressure changes and was very dizzy. This was thought most likely secondary to dehyrdation in the setting of gastroenteritis and poor PO intake as well as medication effects and atrial flutter. His record documents history of autonomic neuropathy, but no further information was available. He had complained of dizziness ___ after his prior discharge and stopped taking some of his antihypertensives including lisinopril, amlodipine and isosorbide mononitrate with some improvement. Prior to this admission, he had re-started lisinopril. Furosemide was held on admission along with amlodipine 10mg, but lisinopril and isosorbide were continued. After volume repletion and rate control, his BP began to climb to SBP 120s-160s day of discharge. On discharge, his furosemide was re-started. If further control is needed, he may need to add back amlodipine. . # Abdominal pain: This pain was lower abdomen, dull and crampy, thought to be due to viral gastroenteritis and constipation. It was found to resolve with passing gas and bowel movements. The patient was continued on simethicone, acetaminophen, ondansetron, and bowel regimen for symptomatic management.

CXR showed resolving PNA from prior CXR during admission for PNA (___). Urine cultures were negative, and blood cultures were pending at time of discharge. CDiff was sent due to loose stool on admission but was negative. #Atrial fibrillation: Hospital course was complicated by afib with RVR, which improved with increased home metoprolol po to 50 mg q6h and with IV metoprolol pushes during RVR episodes. Of note, patient has a high CHADS-VASC score, but per OMR during recent goals of care discussion, anticoagulation is not within family's goals of care and was felt to be too high risk in this patient with prior hemorrhagic stroke. #H\/o prior hemorrhagic CVAs: non-verbal, quadriplegic at baseline. Patient seen by wound team for recommendations (see worksheet for recommendation). ___: Patient's creatinine on admission was 1.4, which is higher than a baseline around 1 but improved from a discharge creatinine of 1.9 from last admission. Her new baseline is unclear currently, as she was thought to have possible ATN in setting of septic shock during prior admission. CHRONIC ISSUES: #CAD complicated by recent type 2 NSTEMI: started aspirin and statin this admission for secondary prevention #Epilepsy: continued home keppra. #COPD: continued home ipratropium nebs #HTN: held home amlodipine throughout admission and at discharge due to BPs around 140 and because metoprolol dose was increased. Amlodipine may be restarted if indicated. #H\/o constipation: continued home docusate, bisacodyl, milk of magnesia, polyethylene glycol #NSTEMI on prior admission: EKG this admission without ST changes. Continued metoprolol as above, and started aspirin 81 mg this admission as well. TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: - Please ensure adequate free water flushes, as hypovolemia is the most likely explanation for abnormal labs; we recommend 250ml H20 q4h - Check chem7 within 1 week of discharge - Home amlodipine discontinued during admission and on discharge given BPs in 140s - Home Lasix held throughout admission and at discharge given hypovolemia. However, would recommend this be restarted at rehab approximately 1 week after discharge if concern for volume overload and recommend follow up BMP accordingly.","summary":"You were seen at ___ due to abnormal labs that were seen at your rehabilitation facility. Specifically, you were found to have low potassium and high sodium. These were felt to be due to dehydration. We gave you some water flushes through your G tube and your sodium improved. We also gave you potassium supplementation, which helped your potassium levels. During your hospital stay, you had fast heart rates, which are related to your atrial fibrillation (a-fib). For this, we increased your metoprolol, which helped your heart rates improve. While you were here, we repeated your chest xray given your recent pneumonia; this was improving on the repeat xray."}

ACTIVE ISSUES: # Chest pain: history suggestive of ACS (substernal chest pain, left arm pain), but ECG showed no acute ischemic changes and TnT was <0.01 x3. Pneumonia was unlikiely given the lack of fevers and CXR with no infiltrates. Most likely etiology is costocondritis; resolved in the ED. . # Alcohol withdrawal: In the ED patient became agitated, diaphoretic, and increasingly tachycardic. CXR was unremarkable. He was given 3mg ativan, 15mg of diazepam for CIWA>10, and was transferred to the MICU for management of alcohol withdrawal. He received B12 and Folic Acid. In the MICU he was afebrile, hypertensive to 161\/100, tachycardic to 114, and was somewhat tremulous and diaphoretic. He was placed on Diazepam 5 mg PO Q1H:PRN for CIWA > 14.

She presented to her nephrologist for routine visit with no acute complaints, except for fatigue that has been ongoing. Her Cr was checked was elevated to 3.3. She was admitted for further evaluation. Calc FENA was 1.4 with UOSMS of 431 at admission, not particularly suggestive of pre-renal physiology. Renal US shows no hydronephrosis, or bladder retention. Pt was producing adequate amounts of urine. Sediment analysis reveled blood which was initially thought to be related partially to ___ supratherapeutic INR. The urine also had abnormal RBC morphology, no casts were seen. Lisinopril, hydralazine and sotalol were all stopped at admission due to poor renal function. She was given fluids with mild decrease in Creatine from 3.3->3.0 which she has stayed stable for the last few days. She has been producing adequate amounts of urine output. The serology returned positive for P-ANCA which is very suggestive of inflammatory process, vasculitis GN. This was thought to be related to hydralazine.

Post biopsy she was started on solumedrol 250mg x 2 days, once the prelimary pathology report confirmed pauci-immune glomerulo nephritis she was given 500mg of solumedrol x 1 day. She was then started on prednisone 50mg PO daily until she is further evaluated by nephrologist. Her creatine remained stable at 3.0, but it did not decreased. The final renal biopsy shows 1+C3 along tubular basement membranes and in vessels. Tubular basement membranes show no IgG deposition. The amount of immune complex deposition noted is consistent with a pauci-immune process (here most likely hydralazine related), but does raise the possibility of a second, immune complex related process. Interestingly, hydralazine is also associated with drug induced lupus like syndrome. Other labs such ___ and ANTI-HISTONE ANTIBODY were also positive. . She was then started on prednisone 50mg PO daily and on cyclophosphamide 75mg daily on the day of discharge. She should continue these meds until she is further evaluated by nephrologist. She will need close follow-up and will need monitoring of her CBC, electrolytes and creatine. She should not be placed on hydralazine and caution should be used when using other medications that can also cause pauci-immune glomerulonephritis such as: propylthiouracil, allopurinol, penicillamine, minocycline.

TSH and digoxin level were within normal limits. Patient had been loaded on amiodarone at outside hospital and was continued on amiodarone drip at 0.5mg\/hr and beta blocker on presentation to ___. On the night of admission, patient had frequent runs of NSVT, longest 15 beats, which started while he was sleeping. While awake, patient reported feeling a sensation of \"warmth\" during some of these runs of NSVT. He was started on low dose metoprolol (both patient and daughter do not recall reason for listed atenolol allergy) and amiodarone drip dose was increased to 1mg\/hr, after which frequency of NSVT runs decreased quickly. During attempted EP ablation of VT tract the next morning, Electrophysiology team was able to map out patient's left ventricle and felt that VT was coming from right ventricle. Patient reported having chest pain during EP procedure, so the procedure was cut short, and patient was sent for Cardiac Catheterization with the presumption that his VT may have been of ischemic etiology. The patient had a PCI of the LCX\/OM with drug-eluting stent, however, felt that this wasn't in the right location to be causing his VT. The patient had no further runs of VT and no further EP procedure was done. If he develops VT in the future he may need his right ventricle mapped to look for a focus of the VT.

He was found to have a right sided pleural effusion on admission to ___ he was noted to have had this effusion in the past which was previously drained and found to be transudative. Effusion appeared to be loculated on lateral decubitus films taken during this hospitalization. Patient's O2 requirement increased post EP and Cath procedures. He was thought to have aspirated during the EP procedure, so flagyl was added to his antibiotic regimen. Pulmonary embolism was considered but felt to be of low suspicion. Lower extremity ultrasound was negative for DVTs bilaterally. Ultimately, he was treated for COPD exacerbation with steroids, despite minimal wheezing on exam, after which his symptoms improved.

Speaking incoherently on admission, unable to answer questions or follow commands. Differential included infection vs vasculitis vs seizure vs drug effects. EEGs x 4 had been negative at OSH. LP at OSH was concerning for encephalitis given bloody ___ tube from tap, elevated protein w\/ ~normal glucose, and lymphocytic predominance on CBC diff. Patient had been started on vancomycin and acyclovir at OSH just prior to transfer. These were continued, and ceftriaxone and ampicillin (for listeria coverage) were added on arrival to ___. In addition, patient had been on Zosyn at OSH due to intermittent fevers and concern for pneumonia due to possible aspiration. Zosyn was discontinued on arrival to ___. HSV CSF PCR came back negative at OSH, thus acyclovir was discontinued. CSF cultures were also negative, thus plan was to discontinue other antibiotics after 7 days. Patient was seen by rheumatology at ___ who felt that despite elevated CCP and rheumatoid factor, it was unlikely that patient's altered mental status was attributable to RA-related vasculitis given lack of articular findings on exam. In addition complement C3 and C4 were within normal limits making vasculitis less likely, also MRA brain findings from OSH were negative for evidence of vasculitis. Neurology was also consulted given concern for seizure or drug-effects as cause of patient's AMS. Patient underwent continuous EEG monitoring, was negative for epileptiform activity, but did show evidence of encephalopathy. Patient had arrived on 3 anti-epileptic medications (keppra, valproic acid, phenytoin) on arrival from OSH. It was thought that these may also have contributed to his worsening mental status. Per neuro recs, valproic acid and phenytoin were discontinued. His mental status did slowly improve with discontinuation of these medications, although was not back to baseline on transfer to medicine floor. However, was able to follow commands, was much more alert. Keppra was also titrated down with plan to discontinue prior to discharge. On discharge patient's mental status continues to wax and wane. He is easily re-directable, and has not been a behavioral issue. He occassionally calls out. # Epistaxis: While being monitored on the medicine service s\/p initial MICU stay, pt was noted to have large clots and substantial epistaxis. Given concern that his airway may become compromised, he was transferred back to the MICU. ENT was consulted and felt that the bleeding was secondary to nasopharyngeal source, although etiology not entirely clear as he was not scoped. ENT packed nare at bedside and adequate hemostasis was achieved. H\/H remained stable thereafter, and no transfusions were necessary. ENT recommended keeping the packing in for 5 days, w\/ cephalexin prophylaxis while the packing remains in place. The packing was removed on ? ___. Given adequate hemostasis, they recommended that anticoagulation not be held if pt required it. # Hospital-acquired pneumonia: patient was found to have infiltrates on CXR on ___ after spiking intermittent fevers. He was started on vancomycin\/cefepime\/flagyl for a planned eight day course to finish on ___. # Seizures: patient noted to have 3 witnessed seizures at OSH. Thought to be partial complex seizures. Was started on 3 anti-epileptics with no further seizure activity noted. EEG x4 noteable for generalized encephalopathy, but no epileptiform activity at OSH. Neurology was consulted at ___. Patient was placed on continuous EEG monitoring, valproic acid and phenytoin were discontinued per neuro recs. No seizure activity seen on EEG, but was encephalopathic. Keppra was titrated down and discontinued. # CVA: Patient reported to have acute stroke at OSH per imaging reads (right inferior parietal lobe). However, on repeat read at ___ of images, ___ teams did not see any acute stroke or evidence of stroke at right inferior parietal lobe. However did note old small lacunar infarcts. Patient was continued on ASA 81 for stroke risk. Also was on heparin drip due to LUE DVT (had this at OSH in arm with PICC), but LUE PICC was removed and re-sited to RUE. Pt also requires anticoagulation due to episode of atrial fibrillation with RVR noted at OSH. INR was therapeutic on ___, heparin gtt discontinued, and warfarin continued. # Atrial fibrillation: Patient noted to have episode of atrial fibrillation w\/ RVR at OSH. New diagnosis. Was started on heparin drip at OSH and rate controlled with metoprolol. Heparin gtt and metoprolol continued at ___. Was in sinus throughout stay in ICU. Warfarin was started and when INR was therapeutic, the heparin gtt was discontinued. # C. diff colitis: patient noted to be c.diff positive on ___ at OSH. Was started on oral vancomycin at OSH. On arrival to ___ patient was continued on PO vanc, however, given patient's mental status, PO administration was problematic. NGT was placed, however became intermittently clogged while in ICU, thus PO vancomycin was discontinued and pt was continued on IV Flagyl. Planned to continue IV flagyl for 7 days following completion of other antibiotics. # Hematuria: Patient with hematuria noted at OSH. Was evaluated by urology at OSH. Hematuria thought secondary to intermittent foley insertion (reportedly had foley removed and replaced multiple times at OSH due to changing mental status). Foley replaced on arrival to ___, hematuria resolved without any specific interventions. However, it reappeared during his return to the MICU and was thought to be ___ pt pulling at the tube. Fortunately, it resolved soon after, and was not investigated further. # Rheumatoid arthritis: Patient continued on prednisone on transfer to ___. Seen by rheumatology while in ___ ICU. Patient noted to have elevated CCP and RF, however, per report this is baseline for patient. Per rheumatology, patient without significant articular disease, thus unlikely to have extra-articular manifestations (vasculitis). Complement C3 and C4 within normal limits - thus vasculitis as cause of patient's AMS unlikely. Prednisone dose was 10mg at discharge which will be managed by his outpatient rheumatologist. # LUE DVT: provoked, DVT occurred in arm with PICC at OSH. Heparin drip started at OSH. Was continued on heparin drip on arrival to ___. LUE PICC was removed which caused the DVT, and PICC was re-sited to the RUE. # Malnutrition: patient with elevated anion-gap, urine ketones at OSH. Likely secondary to poor nutritional status. He had reportedly pulled two NG tubes out. On arrival to ___, NGT was placed. Was started on tube feeds. Speech and swallow were called to evaluate patientt during second MICU stay but were unable to assess pt given depressed mental status following seroquel administration. When they returned to evaluate pt, they determined that he can take nectar thickened liquids and pureed solids. NGT was self-removed on ___, and was not replaced, as patient was taking PO without difficulty. INACTIVE ISSUES --------------- # Hypertension: Pt has HTN listed as a problem in his past medical history but is not on any standing hypertensives. During his second MICU stay, his SBP was noted to be in 190s at times, which required prn captopril.

MICU Course =========== Presented after a fall. Evaluated by neurosurgery on arrival who did not recommend surgical intervention. He was initially admitted to the MICU for labs concerning for hypercarbic respiratory failure. He was also hypotensive requiring levo fed briefly. The Levophed was quickly weaned off. He was never intubated or put on BiPAP for his respiratory failure. His blood pressures were persistently in the ___ systolic. He was mentating appropriately, with a normal lactate. This is assumed to be his baseline. He is s\/p prednisone burst for presumed COPD exacerbation ___ s\/p azithromycin 500mg x 3 days (___) While in the MICU, he was found to have tachy-brady syndrome. Electrophysiology, cardiac surgery, and interventional radiology were all consulted. There was an attempted pacemaker placement for his tachy-brady syndrome on ___ via an attempted R-femoral venous access. However, the pacemaker was not successfully placed due to difficult vascular access. The patient was then transferred to the cardiology floor while awaiting multidisciplinary discussion between electrophysiology, cardiac surgery, vascular surgery, interventional radiology with a approach as to how best to implant the pacemaker. FLOOR COURSE ============ On the floor, there were continued discussion regarding how best to place a pacemaker. Consulting teams requested the operative reports of his prior surgeries so as to better understand his anatomy, however these unfortunately could not be obtained as it was unknown where he had had these surgeries. Consulting teams continued to discuss best approach for providing patient a pacemaker, with a tentative plan for access through his tunneled line or possible epicardial leads.

He would temporarily lose consciousness, have HRs in the ___, and then spontaneously return to his baseline tachycardia and mental status. He had multiple episodes of this on the floor over the night, with the last episode requiring a few seconds of transcutaneous pacing. This prompted his transfer to the CCU. Patient's floor course was also complicated by significant pain requiring breakthrough oxycodone, as well as significant anxiety, which seemed to worsen his symptoms. CCU COURSE ========== In the CCU, patient was monitored while awaiting pacemaker placement and continued to have several episodes of slow atrial fibrillation associated with episodes of presyncope.

During this procedure, ___ performed angioplasty of the R external iliac which was found to be occluded ___ scarring from prior access of this vein. A dialysis catheter was placed as a placeholder to maintain vascular access for pacemaker placement. During this procedure, patient require both levophed and vasopressin to maintain adequate BPs in setting of anesthesia. The patient remained intubated after this procedure and was maintained on two pressors while sedated. On ___, he had a permanent pacemaker placed and remained intubated since his procedure occurred late. He was successfully extubated in the AM of ___. He was weaned off vasopressin and levophed before transfer to the floor. He was followed by Nephrology for HD. Of note, patient continued to have significant anxiety that was acutely exacerbated by his bradycardic episodes in which patient feels he's about to die.

Please see discharge summary by Dr. ___ for full details of the patient's surgical course. Briefly, her course was complicated by acute liver failure and multiple surgeries on her upper extremities, including amputation of her left hand below the elbow. On the surgical service, she was followed by the psychiatry consult team. She was noted to have a bright, inappropriate affect with poor insight into her suicide attempt. She was started on a low dose of zyprexa (2.5mg qhs) with concern for hypomania. Patient tolerated this medication well. Upon transfer to the psychiatric unit, she denied any symptoms of depression or psychosis prior to her suicide attempt. She had been functioning well at work and had enjoyed a vacation with her roommate, ___. On the night before admission, she developed acute pain in her left hand due to a flair in her ___ disease. At that point, she stated that she wanted to pain to end. She impulsively took a large, unknown amount of tylenol and benzos and while intoxicated on these substances, she attempted to cut her hand off. During her hospitalization, she consistently stated that she was glad her hand had been amputated as she would no longer have to endure pain crises. She minimized depressive symptoms, had a bright affect and was looking forward to going home. She denied suicidal ideation throughout her hospitalization and repeatedly stated that she would not need to harm herself again because the hand was gone. She was started on duloxetine (titrated up to 40mg) for pain and mood, and zyprexa was increased to 7.5mg qhs. She tolerated both of these medications well. She was also continued on ambien ___ qhs PRN insomnia, which she had been taking at home. Given her history of lupus, she was evaluated with neuroimaging and cognitive testing to rule out CNS pathology that may have affected impulsivity and mood and contributed to her suicide attempt. A NCHCT was negative and MOCA was normal. A referral was made for neuropsychiatric testing, and they will contact the patient next week.

{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: In summary, this is an ___ year old man with a history of COPD, severe bullous emyphysema, known atrial fibrillation on warfarin, digoxin, verapamil and aspirin who presented with acute onset dyspnea consistent with a pneumothorax. . # PNEUMOTHORAX: This was found to be a spontaneous pneumothorax secondary to rupture of emphysematous bulla, similar to three prior ruptured bullae leading to pneumothorax in the left lung in the past. Pneumothorax was confirmed on chest CT at the outside hospital and reconfirmed at ___. Thoracic Surgery evaluated the patient and noted that surgical intervention was unnecessary at that time. The patient's pneumothorax remained stable on serial chest xrays and the patient's dyspnea improved with oxygen and management of his COPD\/emphysema. . # COPD \/ EMPHYSEMA: The patient was continued on his home regimen of inhaled fluticasone two times daily and albuterol-ipratropium nebulizers every six hours. For breakthrough dyspnea, an additional albuterol nebulizer could be administered every three hours as needed. The patient was weaned from 4L oxygen upon arrival to his home dose of 2L oxygen upon discharge. When admitted, the patient was on 30 mg prednisone daily that had been started to manage a COPD flare prior to this admission. This was tapered to 20 mg prednisone daily by discharge. The patient was given detailed instructions on how to continue the taper and this will be managed while he is an outpatient. Both saline and fluticasone nasal spray were administered to manage the patient's post nasal drip, with moderate effect. . # ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: Patient had known atrial fibrillation managed with digoxin, verapamil and warfarin and had reappearance of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response in the ___ ED. This was likely triggered by his acute pulmonary process -- the pneumothorax and possible COPD flare -- with possible contribution from missing doses of his digoxin and verapamil prior to admission. The patient's cardiac markers were negative x2 and his most recent TSH was within normal limits making hyperthyroidism an unlikely cause for atrial fibrillation. The patient was maintained on 480 mg\/day total of oral verapamil, but dosing changed from twice daily to three times daily dosing to maintain more constant systemic levels of drug. The patient's digoxin was decreased from 0.25 mg to 0.125 mg daily given a borderline elevated serum digoxin level. Telemetry showed that the patient remained in atrial fibrillation but was rate controlled between 85-100 BPM. The patient was found to be subtherapeutic on his initial warfarin dose of 1 mg (INR of 1.1 on admission) and his warfarin was increased to 5mg by discharge. His INRs will be monitored as an outpatient by his primary care physician. . # URINARY RETENTION: The patient has a benign prostatic hyperplasia and was maintained on his home regimen of tamsulosin (Flomax) and finasteride. He had a history of a Foley catheter in place for 2.5 weeks total, removed only 1 week PTA. He presented without a Foley catheter in place and had just completed a course of ciprofloxacin as prescribed by his urologist, but initial urinalysis showed positive nitrites, WBCs and many bacteria; however urine cultures did not grow out any predominant species. A Foley catheter was placed in the ___ ED for patient comfort as patient complained of urinary urgency, frequency, and straining. Because of concern for UTI, the patient underwent several Foley removal \/ voiding trials. However, post void residual bladder scans showed retention of between 500-600cc each time and the Foley catheter was replaced and remained in place upon discharge. The patient will be evaluated by his urologist as an outpatient for further management of his urinary retention; an appointment has been scheduled. . # CONSTIPATION: The patient's constipation was likely secondary to a combination of decreased mobility and the high doses of verapamil needed to manage his atrial fibrillation. As constipation was a likely contributor to the patient's urinary retention, he was placed on an aggressive bowel regimen including Senna, Dulcolax, polyethylene glycol, psyllium (Metamucil), and Colace (bisacodyl), with soap suds enema as needed. . # NUTRITION: The patient's regular diet was supplemented with calcium and vitamin D to treat likely decreased bone density secondary to the patient's current steroid course.","summary":"You were admitted to the hospital for difficulty breathing and you were found to have a pneumothorax in your left upper lung.

Her outpatient cardiologist was concerned that she may have contribution of heart failure as she has had frequent CHF exacerbations in the past. She was admitted to cardiology service and aggressively diuresed with boluses of Lasix 100 mg IV. After aggressive diuresis she underwent right heart catheterization; although PCWP was not able to be obtained directly, a calculated wedge was consistent with pressures < 20 mmHg, suggesting only mild-moderate LV dysfunction. She was then transferred to medicine service. Dyspnea was thought likely primarily pulmonary process and may be component of obesity hypoventilation syndrome plus asthma exacerbation in setting of recently decreased prednisone dose. She was given prednisone 40 mg x2 and placed on slow prednisone taper. Dyspnea improved and she was discharged on pred taper and home asthma regimen. # Chronic diastolic CHF: History of CHF exacerbations and last ECHO showing EF>55%. Underwent right heart catheterization as above. She was discharged on torsemide PO 60 mg daily and thought to be euvolemic. # Atrial fibrillation: New diagnosis in ___ but unable to tolerate metoprolol due to junctional bradycardia. Warfarin was held for right heart cath and she was bridged on heparin gtt given renal function and body habitus not amenable to lovenox. Post-procedure warfarin restarted and heparin gtt discontinued when INR reached 2.0. CHRONIC ISSUES # CKD: Likely due to DM and HTN.

She was successfully extubated on ___ and weaned off pressor support. She was transferred to the ward on ___ from the ICU. . # Shock: Patient met SIRS criteria with temperature, leukocytosis and tachycardia. Likely source was unclear although this was most likely septic shock due to pneumonia despite equivocal CXR. She did have a moderately positive UA on admission with ___ WBC and moderate bacteria which latterl, but there was no growth on urine culture. Cardiogenic shock was possible given the elevated CE but unlikely to be associated with a fever to 104. CT-head and LP were unremarkable. The patient received Vancomycin and Ceftriaxone at the OSH. Her lactate rose to 3.1 on ___ and this decreased to 2.0 on ___. She had a central line and A-line inserted and her hemodynamics were closely monitored. She was treated with IV broad spectrum abx in the ICU with Vancomycin\/Cefepime\/Ciprofloxacin and later continued on cefepime and vancomycin. She had no further fevers and she required inoptropic support with norepinephrine for hypotension. She was sedated with fentanyl and midazolam. Her WBCs were elevated at 13.7 on admission and with therapy this trended down to 9.2 on ___. She was weaned off inotropes and received IV fluid boluses to maintain her BP. Given a possible cardiac cause, she received aspirin and her cardiac enzymes were cycled and were stable at 0.26. Echo on ___ showed no evidence of endocarditis or pericardial effusion with normal LV size and wall thickness with borderline hyperdynamic biventricular systolic function in the setting of severe TR. OSH cultures were followed; we contacted ___ ___ (___) when all cx were still negative, csf neg, wbc 6, rbc 1, 2 sets blood cultures neg, no urine cx. BP improved, she no longer required frequent fluid boluses, and she was successfully extubated on ___. She was transferred from the ICU on ___. She was treated with vanco\/cefepime for HCAP, as we thought she lived in a facility, but it turned out that she lived at home. She improved markedly so we decided to keep her on an 8 day course of this regimen via PICC line. Her code status was confirmed with her husband as being DNR but ok to intubate only while here as means to transition her home as we are able. . #. Respiratory Failure: Pt was intubated after she was found to have agonal breathing and was not protecting her airway. Her CXR did not show a clear infiltrate but she did have LLL collapse. There was no fluid overload or other acute process that would explain her respiratory failure although given her presentation it was felt that this may have been secondary to aspiration or community-acquired pneumonia. Her respiratory difficulties were more likely due to decreased consciousness from poor brain perfusion secondary to her shock. She was successfully extubated on ___ and maintained her saturations on 40% O2 with her ABG 7.44\/28\/113\/20. She was closer to baseline post-extubation and was stable on transfer to the floor on ___. . #. ___: Pt had elevated ALT and AST with normal AP and TBili. This does not appear to be an obstructive picture and likely represents shock liver. Tox screen negative. LFTs trended down. Final CT A\/P read for signs of chronic liver disease demonstrated mottled enhancement of the liver which may be secondary to congestion. #. Anemia: Pt Hct on admission was 30.7.

In the ICU here, she was treated with Vanc\/Cefepime for possible HAP (it was initially thought that she resided in a nursing home). She was extubated on ___ in the afternoon and continued to show clinical improvement. Her course has been notable for: NSTEMI with elevated troponins in the setting of septic shock, with unremarkable EKGs, as well as radiographic evidence of LLL collapse. A PICC line was placed for IV antibiotics and a family meeting was held (per documentation by Dr. ___ and the family wishes to take Ms. ___ home when medically stable for ongoing care. Her antibiotics were continued through ___. . On the morning of ___, she was noted to have some myoclonic jerking, leg jerking, eye fluttering. Neurology was consulted and they felt these movements were likely in the setting of severe metabolic disturbance and infection. Though seizures were unlikely, an EEG was ordered, and it showed diffuse encephalopathic changes of a moderate to moderately severe nature. It is suggestive, by virtue of the triphasic appearance, that this is probably metabolic although it could be easily metabolic associated with diffuse degenerative disease. No clear seizure activity was identified. . Repeat CXR on ___ confirmed ongoing LLL collapse. It is possible that this this will improve with chest ___ and increased aeration of the lungs.

He underwent ERCP ___, multiple stones noted in CBD, so pt underwent sphicterotomy\/stent placed. Recommended cipro\/flagyl X7days which pt received. Pt will need repeat ERCP in 4 weeks for stent removal. Pts alk phos and T bili began to trend down to 2.0 by discharge, but alk phos remained elevated up into the 800s-900s. Per ERCP, this persistent alkaline phosphatase elevation is to be expected with a CBD stent in place. RUQ US ___ comments on sludge in R biliary tree, L biliary tree dilation, sludge\/stones in GB, and remaining stones\/sludge in CBD. Per discussion with ERCP fellow, plan will be to go back in in 4 weeks for repeat ERCP to clean out remaining stones. Given bilirubin has been trending down and pts mental status has been improving, ERCP did not want to go back in to do any further ERCP procedure at this time. . # Delirium\/Encephelopathy: Per family, pt has had ongoing confusion for over a year, but worse over the past 2 months, unclear how acute his current delirium was. His worsening delirium certainly could be his choledocholithiasis. He underwent ERCP with stone extraction as per above and was treated with cipro\/flagyl, but pt had acute episode of agitation even after the ERCP was completed and stones were removed. Advanced AIDS brings up infectious, neoplastic, and AIDS related etiologies. Note, TSH, B12 were normal. RPR was negative. He had no evidence of benzo\/ETOH withdrawl (tox negative on admission and daughter\/pt deny recent use; also, stable vital signs). UA\/CXR were unremarkable. MRI of the head was not impressive (no suggestion of infection or PML). LP was performed on ___ and had only 3 WBC, unremarkable protein\/glucose. ___ virus PCR was negative in the CSF. CSF HIV VL was 1040. CSF VDRL was pending at discharge. CSF cytology was negative for malignant cells. Of note, pt had acute agitation episode ___ am with a CODE Purple called, required haldol\/ativan and psychiatric evaluation. He was calm the following day. Highest on the differential of pts delirium and intermittent agitation is HIV encephalopathy. ID felt that resuming ___ is the only chance for any reversal, but resuming ___ was complicated by pts social situation as per below. Also, given pts h\/o Hep C, cirrhosis and hepatic encephalopathy was felt to be possible. He was started on lactulose as a trial to see if this would help with pts confusion. RUQ US showed no evidence of cirrhosis or nodular contour to the liver. Lactulose was stopped. Pts mental status did improve while here, possibly due to either ERCP with cleaning of some of the CBD sludge vs. lactulose. He was started on ___ on ___ as per below. Pt was evaluated by OT, and pt had ___ recall (although delayed), mild impairment in medication management, and anxiety over performing complex tasks. It was felt by OT that pt is safe to be discharged home alone ( he was able to say what to do in case of fire, in case of injury, etc; he does not use the stove) as long as someone checks in on him and helps him with his medications. Pt will have outpatient OT home visits and home safety eval. . . # AIDS: Pt had recent CD4 17, on repeat here was 70. HIV viral load here was 283,000. Has refused ARVs in past, even recently had been restarted ___ but never filled his prescriptions. Pt now expressed interest in treatment, especially given concern of HIV encephalopathy. Pt is s\/p LP\/MRI as above to eval reversible causes and to eval for PML, CNS lymphoma, TB, neurosyphilis, etc. CSF cytology was negative, and culture for both fungal\/bacterial were negative at time of discharge. He was continued on bactrim prophylaxis and azithromycin prophylaxis was started. He received nystatin for thrush. Upon discussion between pt, ID,and pts outpatient ID Dr. ___, ___ was made to restart pt on Truvada and Kaletra. Discussion between this hospitalist, pt, SW, and daughter took place in which it was decided that pts daughter would need to bring pts ___ medications with her to pts house twice a day in order to ensure complicance. Meeting between this hospitalist, ID, social work, pt, pt's daughter, and case management took place, discussing barriers to compliance. Pts daughter agrees to bring pts ___ meds directly to him twice a day under her observation for at least the first several months. Pt also discusses sometimes having dysphagia and depression (causing binges on benzos) which are barriers. See below for further discussion of these. The patient will need to follow up with ID, Dr. ___, in 4 weeks for lab check and refill on his ___ medications. # HCV: LFTs elevated likely ___ choledocholithasis (alk phos\/tbili) but transaminitis may reflect chronic active hep C. INR is WNL, but albumin low at 2.5. Unclear if TBili elevation may be chronic as well. HCV viral load was 5,360,000. Again, RUQ US here showed no nodular contour to liver or evidence of cirrhosis. Pt will follow up with his outpatient ID doctor. . # Liver lesion: Following pts discharge, pts final read on his liver ultrasound states\" 2-cm echogenic hepatic lesion likely within the segment VII of the liver is fairly well-defined. This could represent a hemangioma, however, in this patient with a complicated biliary pathology, this is uncertain. If the patient's condition worsened, CT or MRI could evaluate further. If the patient's condition improves, an MRI is recommended within the three months to characterize completely.\" Thus, would recommend follow up MRI to further characterize this lesions. Pts PCP, ___ be sent a copy of this discharge summary as well as a fax regarding this finding. . # Social: Difficult disposition as pt has not cared for himself for long time exhibiting self-destructive behavior, now resulting in encephelopathy (?dementia) with periods of worsening delirium. Unclear how much is reversible. ID feels only chance is ___ therapy but needs monitored setting to ensure compliance. As per above, pt was assessed by OT and felt safe to go home with supervision of his medication management. Pts daughter has agreed to come to his home twice a day with his ___ medications. Pt will have home ___, OT, and SW arranged at time of discharge. # Polysubstance abuse\/IVDU: Pt is on 149 mg methadone daily at his clinic, confirmed. Pt received 140 mg daily while here. Addictions was consulted, especially given pts abuse of ativan and need for ___ compliance. . # Dysphagia: Pt reports one of his barriers to taking his HIV medications is having difficulty swallowing his pills. ERCP commented on no strictures in the esophagus\/stomach. Per pts daughter, pt has had a negative UGI series in the past. He has not had difficulty swallowing his pills here thus far. Can consider outpatient barium swallow to assess motility if pt complains of further dysphagia. . # Depression: Pt admits to feeling depressed, which causes him to binge on benzos. We discussed that restarting ___ may help some of his depression. He will have social work visit his home. He agreed to starting celexa, which he was discharged on. .","summary":"You were admitted for confusion. You have HIV encephelopathy. You were restarted on HIV medications.

Her insulin regimen was changed from 5OU to lantus and close follow-up was arranged. Concern for Munchausen Syndrome was raised in the setting of witnessed sugar consumption and ultimate down-titration of insulin requirement. . ACTIVE ISSUES: # Hyperglycemia: Ms. ___ has difficult to control blood sugars, possibly secondary to insulin lipodistrophy vs. DMII difficult to control s\/p pancreatectomy vs. Munchausen. She interestingly responded dramatically from 500s to 300s with 10 units insulin in the emergency department which was replicated on the general medical floor, supporting a diagnosis of insulin lipodistrophy. However, the patient was also found eating sugar packets while having high blood sugars. In this scenario, it was difficult to titrate her insulin regimen. She was given extensive counseling from the ___ consult service and general medical team regarding glucose control. A psychiatry consult was placed given concern for Munchausen in light of her labile blood sugars, outpatient glucose regimen for concentrated insulin, witnessed sugar packet consumption and multiple prior admissions for hyperglycemia often complicated by diabetic ketoacidosis. The pschiatry consult felt there was \"no clear evidence that Ms. ___ was intentionally contributing to worsening of her illness; although she may have deficits in understanding the correct approach to managing her illness, and subtle neuropsychiatric contributions could be considered.\" She was ultimately discharged on 20 units of lantus with a significant humalog sliding scale and close follow-up with both her primary care physician and ___ providers. .

INACTIVE ISSUES: # Chronic pain: She has chronic migraine headaches, right face and arm complex regional pain syndrome requiring pain clinic nerve blocks, and chronic abdominal pain from pancreatitis. She was started on sumatriptan in place of her home triptan not provided through non-formulary, in addition to home gabapentin and doxepin. She was discharged on her home regimen. . # Chronic nausea: Followed by GI as an outpatient. She was continued on metoclopramide and omeprazole. . # Hypertension: She was continued on clonidinde and propranolol. . # Iron deficiency anemia: She has received IV iron in the past with good result. . # Migraine headaches: She was continued on topamax and naratriptan.

Pt was kept on standing albuterol and ipratropium nebs, which was weaned down to prn. Home advair was restarted after pt finished the steroid course. Pt had significant improvement of breathing status. On discharge, she was breathing comfortably on room air with good O2 sat at both at rest and on ambulation. She was discharged home with her home inhaler regimen and without her prior daily azithromycin dose. She has close PCP and pulmonary clinic follow up. # NSTEMI with plaque rupture vs. stress cardiomyopathy vs. coronary vasospasm - Pt presented with chest tightness along with COPD exacerbation. Troponin T was 0.2 > 0.03, MB was 11 > 3. ECHO showed new moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction c\/w CAD in the territory of a mid LAD. Pt therefore underwent cath. Cath however did not reveal significant occlusion thus no stent was placed. Cath however did find haziness at LAD region, raising the possibility of possible plaque rupture. Pt was discharged home with plavix and aspirin. She was also started on a ace-i, beta blocker, and statin prior to discharge. Appointment was made with new cardiologist at ___. It is recommended that pt has follow up ECHO in a few months to eval for possible resolution of systolic dysfunction given concern for potential stress cardiomyopathy in the setting of COPD flare. # Sinus tachycardia - Initially presented with sinus tachycardia, thought to be related to standing albuterol inhalers as well as anxiety. OSH CTA was negative for PE. Pt was started on metoprolol. She was given ativan prn for anxiety. Tylenol was prescribed prn for pain.

There was also some concern that you may have a problem with your heart because of some blood tests and EKG findings. We did an echocardiogram which showed reduced heart functioning which raised concern that you had maybe had a heart attack. We then did a heart catheterization to see if you actually had evidence of narrow heart arteries which would have caused a heart attack. We saw some slight abnormality in one of the main arteries, but nothing that seemed to be responsible for what happened and nothing that we could fix with a stent. It is likely you had a blockage of that artery in the past and it has opened up a bit since. Alternatively, you may have had stress-induced cardiac dysfunction in the setting of your severe shortness of breath with your COPD flare. We will need you to repeat an echocardiogram in a few months with your cardiologist to see if your heart function improves.

The studies showed no evidence of acute infarction and no evidence of vascular occlusion, stenosis or aneurysm greater than 3 mm in size. . A transthoracic echocardiogram was performed to evaluate for cardiac contributions to the patient's symptom complex. The final report was pending at the time of discharge. It was recommended that he take asprirn 325 mg by mouth daily pending the results of the study. . To evaluate modifiable risk factors for stroke, lipids and glycosylated hemoglobin were measured. As the LDL was found to be 92, no changes were made to the statin dosing. Although the HBA1C was 5.4 %, blood glucose was monitored regularly and an insulin sliding scale was instituted to maintain normoglycemia. . As there was some concern that the episode could have been a seizure, an EEG was done. Although the final report was pending at the time of discharge, an initial interpretation was essentially normal. For his safety, however, it was suggested that he refrain from driving at least until the results of the investigative bloodwork return. . Upon further interview, the patient volunteered that he might have taken 1.5 tabs of ambien (rather than 1.5 tabs of pravastatin) by mistake on the morning of the event.

GI was consulted and recommended bowel prep with EGD and colonoscopy. These were completed without evidence of bleed. They then recommended capsule study. This first study with capsule unfortunately stuck in patient's stomach and so was unsuccessful study. Repeat EGD performed with post-pyloric Capsule placement. This study also did not reveal a source of bleeding either. Given negative EGD and ___ suspect small bowel source though given BRBPR would expect her to be HD unstable or with significant Hct drop since this would indicate a brisk bleed however she remained HD stable and with stable Hct for several days. She did not receive a transfusion # Crohn's disease: Inflammatory markers were low and colonoscopy was without evidence of inflammation.

{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: ___ male w\/ h\/o substance abuse and depression, found altered, hypothermic and hypotensive. After his ICU admission he was transferred to the floor in stable condition although his creatinine continued to rise. After that improved with no intervention other than diuresis, he was discharged in stable condition to a shelter for help with his polysubstance dependency issues. . # Altered mental status: Most likely secondary to an ingestion. Patient later admitted to heroin ingestion. Percocet and Oxycontin bottles found in his room. Urine tox positive for opiates (on a screen that does not detect oxycodone) and cocaine. Other possibilities would be sepsis, post-ictal phase, toxic\/metabolic encephalopathy, hepatic or renal encephalopathy. Toxicology was consulted and thought this could be due to tylenol overdose or cocaine in setting of elvated LFTs, although OSH tylenol was negative. Patient started on ___ protocol and completed with resolution of LFTs. Patient mental status cleared by the time patient was tranferred to the floor. Patient states his only ingestion leading up to admission was his home vicodin, heroin (inhaled) and clonipin. Patient MS continued to improve but in setting of worsening renal failure, patient carefully monitered for uremic encephalopathy. On the floor the patients mental status returned to normal, labs improved and the patient was discharged with a normal mental status. . # Hypotension\/hypothermia: Differential originally included drug overdose, hypovolemia and overwhelming infection. Patient had no source of infection as CXR and lung exam clear, UA negative, no abdominal pain therefore antbiotics were withheld. Per toxicology, differential of ingestion in setting of initial bradycardia includes calcium channel blockers, beta blockers and digoxin. Patient had no change in blood sugars and his digoxin level was negative. Patient was continued on IVF wide open, especially in setting of rhabdo. Patient was eventually weaned from pressors that were started in the MICU. Once patient had stable BP for 24hrs, patient was transferred to the floor. Patient continued to have stable blood pressures for the rest of his admission. . # Transaminitis: Most likely due such as Tylenol vs shock liver. Started on N-Acetylcysteine in ED, received full course. Believe that LFTs could have been elevated with acute tylenol overdose but hypoperfusion is more likely especially as patient has signs of hypoperfusion with his kidneys with evidence of ATN. LFTs continue to downtrend. INR continues to downtrend as well. At time of discharge his LFTs had normalized, his INR was baseline and he did not require further checks of his LFTs. . # Rhabdomyolysis: Appears to be localized primarily to his lower extremities. Could be cocaine, an exercise supplement, or prolonged period down. Patient started on aggressive fluid resuscitation for his first few days in the MICU. Patient continued to have downtrending CK with eventual DC of fluids especially in the setting of worsening renal failure. . # Acute renal failure: Likely a combination of hypovolemia (hypoperfusion) and rhabdomyolysis. Patient aggressively fluid resuscitated as above, with down trending CK. Urinalysis showed evidence of muddy brown casts consistent with ATN, most likely due to hypoperfusion. Renal ultrasound was negative for any other acute process. Patient creatinine continued to trend up, as well as BUN. Patient was hypervolemic on examination and per renal given large dose lasix to try to improve kidney function. Patient was monitered for signs of uremic encephalopathy. Patient also had increasing anion gap most likely due to uremia. Patient was followed by nephrology and did not require any HD as he reached plateau and then began having downtrending creatinine which was siginificantly improved at the time of disposition. Urine output remained excellent . # Elevated lipase: Likely from hypotension, never c\/o abdominal pain. Lipase trended down with fluid resuscitation. . # Elevated troponin: Likely from overall hypoperfusion. EKG was reassuring. Enzymes were trended and came down without EKG changes. . # Depression\/substance abuse: Patient has hx of severe depression. It was unclear if patient had suicide attempt. Per family, patient's depression has been getting more severe and in turn his drug abuse more frequent. Social work was involved in patient's care early. Once patient's sensorium cleared, patient evaluated by psych who thought the patient was stable from a psychiatric point of view. He will be discharged to a shelter where he can continue his rehabilitation. . Transitional care: 1. CODE: Full 2. Medication changes: No longer on anti-depressants 3.

You were seen by neurosurgery who sutured the wound closed to prevent further bacteria from getting in."}
{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: #Legal: ___ #Safety: Patient remained in good behavioral control throughout hospitalization. She did not require behavioral or chemical intervention. #Psychiatric: -Psychosis NOS: Upon admission, patient stated that she felt \"in a fog\" and has been ruminating about the voices that she hears. Patient believed the cause of the voices has to do with a re-occurring memory involving a family gathering in ___ in which she observed other people \"getting scared\" and during which she \"passed out.\" She also stated that for the last couple months she had been unsure if her husband was her real husband or her son was her real son. ___ hearing voices of her relatives from ___ that made encouraging remarks such as \"be strong\" but also enforced her belief that her husband was an impostor. Endorsed noncompliance with Lexapro at home, but was compliant with Abilify until she had a nosebleed and was concerned that it was related to this medication. Refused to receive Abilify Maintena because she felt she did not need it and did not trust her husband. She was amenable to hospitalization in so far as that she believed she \"needed answers\" and does not feel safe to return home. In the context of the last few years of depression (low mood, crying spells, anergia, trouble focusing\/concentrating, isolation, social anxieties, sleep trouble), the pt has had intermittent bouts of psychotic features. For example, she often feared that something bad will happen to her mother and brother; she heard voices (they used to be persecutory but now are calm and supportive voices); ideas of reference (uses \"creativity\" to cope - she explains that she puts music and art together when she gets stressed); she believed her eyeballs were changing colors; pt wondered if her family were being kept away from her (i.e. she was paranoid about not hearing from her mother as often as she used to). Endorsed SI prior to hospitalization in the setting of feeling \"helpless\" and mistreated by the EMTs that brought her to the hospital. Denied SI or HI upon admission. Does not have concerns about her safety on the unit. Continued patient's PO abilify in addition to administering Maintena injection on ___. Pt reported no side effects or adverse events. She continued to endorse auditory hallucinations and demonstrated intermittent loosening of associations, but her reality testing slowly improved during admission. Patient hesitant to sign ___ application for home services ___ prominent paranoia, but acquiesced as symptoms lessened. Both she and her husband agreed that she would benefit from home based support with her medications. Additionally reinforced with patient the importance of engaging in the community and social functions to prevent isolation in her psychosis. Arranged for follow-up with patient's psychiatrys and therapist, in addition to arranging partial hospital program after discharge. Submitted ___ application on ___. Also spoke with husband about future consideration of guardianship, in light of patient's recent hospitalizations. -Alcohol abuse vs dependence: Per collateral, patient had been drinking one bottle of wine daily \"for the past few months\" prior to admission. She initially minimized her behavior, but as admission progressed, she attributed most of her interpersonal difficulties to her drinking. Believed that she \"just needed detox\" and \"everything would be okay.\" Patient did not show any signs\/symptoms of alcohol withdrawal during admission. Discussed with patient, in presence of husband, the importance for her to stay sober upon discharge. Patient agreed and articulated understanding #Medical: There were no acute medical issues addressed during this hospitalization. #Social\/Milieu: Patient was initially isolative in her room but became more visible as admission progressed. She attended few occupational therapy groups. Was not seen interacting with other patients. #Collateral: Dr. ___ ___ has seen this patient for about ___. States that Mrs. ___ has always presented as very calm, intelligent, and well put together during meetings. She is \"slow to open up to providers\" but over time, has revealed many concerning psychotic signs\/sx to Dr. ___. Mrs. ___ has a history of the following psychotic signs: 1)Paranoia (during episodes of decompensation, she accuses her husband of affairs and becomes very worried about his intentions), 2)Bizarre Behaviors (husband has reported that the pt will start howling and growling at home, while posturing - he has reportedly videotaped some of these events, 3) Hallucinations (pt has long reported persecutory auditory hallucinations), 4) Negative sx (at times she won't take care of ADLs and displays some pmr). She also commented on patient's increasing alcohol consumption (drinking appx 1 bottle of wine per night, although she continues to minimize this use). Much of the above tends to be triggered by the holidays of ___ when the patient travels with her husband to visit much family. This tends to amplify her sx and admissions have often been congruent with this time of year. The patient's family have had to come to ___ to assist her husband in caring for the patient. Reportedly, the mother and brother feel overwhelmed and have now chosen to disconnect from the pt because of her behaviors. Mrs. ___ took Risperdal ___ in the past. She did very well about ___ year ago, when she did not travel for ___ ___, supplemented regimen with po Risperdal, and did not require hospitalization . She was noncompliant, however, with Risperdal and chose to take Abilify. She was also noncompliant with this and had refused Maintena since stopping in ___. Husband characterized patient as always being somewhat rebellious and challenging of those in authority, and patient admitted to transferring some of her struggles with her father onto her husband following his death. Articulated awkwardness relationships currently as husband is in the position of monitoring patient's medication compliance and how this serves as an imbalance in their relationship. Husband stated that often times when he is not available or is traveling, patient will discontinue her medications. Patient has also been more sensitive to him being away and feeling insecure about what husband may be doing when he is not at home. Asked for referral to ___ for home based services. #Risk Assessment: Patient carries several risk factors for self-harm including several recent hospitalizations for psychotic decompensation ___ medication non-compliance, chronic and severe mental illness, alcohol abuse, social isolation, unemployment, marriage strain, worsening neurovegetative symptoms, lack of insight and transient suicidal ideation. However, she carries several protective factors including her established relationship with her psychiatrist, her supportive husband, lack of suicidal gestures in the past, desire to improve relationship with son and husband, and help seeking behavior, including willingness to accept Abilify Maintena injection and desire to connect with psychiatrist and therapist post-discharge. #Prognosis: Patient is at low or intermittent risk of self-harm insofar as she remains medication compliant and engaged in outpatient treatment, which includes regular socialization and activities outside of her home. However, if she devolves into her psychosis further due to non-compliance, she will likely require hospitalization. Discussed with patient's husband likelihood of pursuing guardianship in the future.","summary":"You were admitted for alcohol abuse, auditory hallucinations, and bizarre behavior as reported by your husband and psychiatrist. It was reported that ___ hadn't been taking your medications, which likely made your symptoms worse. We gave ___ an injection of Abilify, which ___ should continue to receive on a monthly basis, and we restarted ___ on oral Abilify."}
{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: This is a ___ year old right handed woman with a history of of Type II DM on low dose insulin, aortic stenosis, severe OA, ESRD on HD (q TuThSa), chronic SC vein thrombosis (secondary to lines) on coumadin, multiple HD line infections, who developed dysarthria and left sided weakness during dialysis on ___. ACTIVE ISSUES: # Altered Mental Status\/dysarthria and left sided weakness: The patient was taken to the Emergency department and a stroke code was called. Her work up was not concerning for an acute intracranial process. Her left sided weaknesses was resolved when seen on the floor, although she was still slurring her speech and confused compared to her baseline. The differential included a toxic\/metabolic vs infectious vs hypoperfusion of the brain. Given that this happened while she was on HD, and that this is reminiscent of her recent presentation and admission, it seems likely that hypoperfusion secondary to hypotension during dialysis is the likely cause of her altered mental status. She has known Aortic stenosis, calcifications found throughout her carotids on CT, and a known history of subclavian thrombosis. She is no longer taking clonidine for HTN and was still on her lisinopril. She takes lisinopril on HD days, and in the setting of her delicate blood pressures, this could have precipitated a transient cerebral ischemia in the watershed areas. Infection was also considered although she has not exhibited a fever or mounted a white count. Her LFTs are wnl. She also does not exhibit any signs or symptoms of an infectious process. She has a recent history of a yeast infection, however this is unlikely to cause global mental status changes unless she is fungemic. She could also have a toxic\/metabolic process, given that she had asterixis on exam. However her electrolytes were at her baseline. Neurologically, though there was no evidence of an obvious stroke on Head CT\/A she also could have had a TIA given report of focal neurodeficit. She has vessel disease (CAD, DM2, and carotid calcifications). An MRI would better characterize lesions, but she cannot get gadolidium due to her renal function. Per neuro recs: If patient has a return of more focal symptoms that do not resolve with improvement in her blood pressure, can consider MRI for infarct\/PRES, but no clear indication to do so now. . We held her blood pressure medication (lisinopril) and other sedating medications (gapapentin and clonazepam). The morning on ___, she was more lucid and at her baseline according to her primary care physician and her systolic blood pressures were in the 100s. . INACTIVE ISSUES: # Subclavian thrombosis-her INR trended from 1.6-->1.9->2.4. We continued home dose of warfarin at 3mg qd, and did not start IV Heparin. . # Right shoulder pain- likely due to degenerative disease and underlying renal osteodystrophy and osteoarthritis given her obese body habitus. She was given tylenol for pain control and we avoided NSAIDs given her history of H Pylori. . # CAD - She had no chest pain, and her EKG was congruent with her baseline. We continued home Simvastatin 40mg daily, Aspirin 81 mg daily and held her home Lisinopril given soft blood pressures. . # ESRD: on HD for the past ___ years, we continued HD (TuThSa) and her home medications: Sevelamer 3200 mg tid, Calcitriol 0.5 mcg daily, B complex-vitamin C- folic acid 1 mg daily . # GERD - asymptomatic on admission, but developed some acid reflux in the morning of ___. We continued her home Omeprazole 20mg qd . # DM II - last A1c 5.81 on ___, glucose today was 136. On 3 units NPH qhs. She has a healing right heel ulcer. She was on an ISS while in house with well controlled blood glucose and we placed a boot on her right heel. . # L breast edema - stable, had a workup as an outpatient with no evidence of breast cancer . TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: please follow up with the following - blood pressure medication titration - setting patient up with home blood pressure cuff - Left breast edema - right heel ulcer that is healing - blood culture results","summary":"You were admitted with altered mental status, slurred speech and weakness on your left side. We admitted you to observe your mental status. While you were at hemodialysis on the morning of ___, you were found to have slurred speech and your systolic blood pressure dropped. You were confused, had report of weakness on the left side of your body, and you were sent the ___ Emergency department. They thought that you might have had a stroke, but found that you didn't have evidence of this on a head CT, a strong Xray picture of your brain. You were sent to the medical team to watch monitor your mental status. Your electrolytes were normal for you and you did not seem to have an infection, thus we believe that this episode was caused by hypotension (low blood pressure) which delivered less blood to your brain and caused you to have your symptoms of confusion and slurred speech. Your left sided weakness had resolved by the time you came to the medicine floor. Your mental status improved with your blood pressure and by the time you left you were at your normal self. In recent times, it does not seem that you have hypertension (high blood pressure) and now it seems that you have hypotension(low blood pressure), so we recommend stopping your anti-hypertension medication (lisinopril) because that may be contributing to ___ hypotension(low blood pressure)."}

{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: ___ year old woman with ESRD on HD, CAD, sCHF (EF45%), who presents with several weeks of bilateral hip and back pain, bowel incontinence, and difficulty walking. # Back & hip pain: Pt. had previously been admitted to ___ for similar symptoms and an MRI was performed that by report was interpreted as a fluid collection around L4, concerning for edema vs. abscess. There was no intervention performed at that time. On admission to the ___, she reported long-term bladder incontinence, several weeks of bowel incontinence, and low back pain. She had pain with standing that prevented ambulation, but she had no lower extremity weakness or ___ numbness and her rectal tone was assessed by Neuro in the ED and found to be \"moderate.\" Neurologic exam on the floor showed preserved ___ strength in all muscle groups in the lower extremities. Based on this, suspicion for cauda equina syndrome was low. Neurosurgery was consulted and recommended evaluation with bone scan & MRI to assess for abscess or osteomyelitis. This was obtained on ___ and was read as a nonrecent compression fracture of the L4 vertebral body with moderate stenosis of the spinal canal and severe stenosis of the neural foramen at L4-5. Bone scan showed increased uptake at L4 w\/ no evidence of metastatic bone disease elsewhere. Based on these results, neurosurgery stated that they did not think the patient had an abscess or osteomyelitis and recommended conservative management. They offered that a CT guided bone bx could be obtained if concern remained high. This was considered, but after discussion with Radiology & Nuclear Medicine, who felt that her imaging did not support a diagnosis of either, the primary team decided to discharge pt. with a plan for follow-up regarding a bone biopsy per Neurosurgery's recommendations. Of note, patient remained afebrile with a normal white blood cell count throughout her stay. None of her blood cultures showed growth at time of discharge, though she did have an elevated ESR to 110 and a CRP to 59.7.

Per gyn, patient has presumed adenomyosis that has been treated with IUD placement x2. First IUD at previous admission was found to be expulsed. This admission, ultrasound and KUB did not identify the second IUD placed by gyn. Given patient failed 2 attempts at IUD placement due to spontaneous expulsion, patient was started on oral medroxyprogesterone for systemic therapy. Endometrial biopsy was performed that did not show evidence of malignancy. Patient was referred for uterine artery embolization per ___. Unfortunately, urterine arteries were too small, and embolization procedure was unsuccessful. She was initiated on progesterone and had resolution of her bleeding. See management of anticoagulation and antiplatelet as below. Will f\/u with GYN as outpatient, next appointment ___. #CAD\/Recent DES to LAD ___: Patient recently admitted for NSTEMI in ___ and is s\/p DES to LAD. She was discharged on triple therapy (ASA, Plavix, and Coumadin) for 1 mo, with plan then transition to Plavix\/Coumadin (no ASA) for at least 3mo. Patient did not develop new chest pain or L axillary pain (anginal equivalent). EKG upon arrival did not show evidence of new ischemia. She did show a mild troponin elevation, which downtrended, likely due to CKD with possible demand ischemia due to severe anemia. Given her anemia, warfarin was held, and patient continued on ASA, Plavix. Once bleeding stabilized her Coumadin was restarted. Once she reached therapeutic INR on warfarin her aspirin was discontinued to reduce her risk of bleed. She will continue on Plavix and Coumadin as outpatient. She required higher doses of Coumadin than previous home doses to get INR back in range. Will be d\/c'd on Coumadin 15mg daily.

Cirrhosis: patient has cirrhosis with no history of liver biopsy. He is being considered for placement on the transplant list and has initiated the steps to completing what is necessary for the evaluation. On arrival to the floor, his MELD score=16. He had signficant ascites on exam, with 3+pitting edema extending from his feet up over his abdomen. He is not on diuretics currently (they were withdrawn 3 weeks ago for refractory to this) We attempted to perform a therapeutic paracentesis at the bedside however, we were unable to get adequate access either due to kinking of the catheter with all of the subcutaneous edema or due to accessing a pocket that was not connecting to the rest. His diagnositic paracentisis showed no evidence of SBP but had a low total protein so he was started on cipro 250 for SBP prophylaxis. The access site continued to leak overnight after the procedure and a stitch was placed. This will need to be removed in ___ days. The patient was instructed on how to care for it. He will need to discuss with Dr. ___ or not a therapeutic tap on an outpatient basis is warranted. Hepatitis B- given the high viral load that the patient had, he was started on tenofavir at the time of discharge. Renal function- patient had elevated creatinine weeks prior to admission, which had been downtrending since then and was WNL at the time of admission. His urine lytes showed almost no urine pointing towards a prerenal picture, and his UA was negative with Urine culture still pending at the time of discharge.

{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: ___ man with morbid obesity, DM, HTN, and asthma admitted with dyspnea in the setting of volume overload and possible allergic reaction. . # Dyspnea: Likely multifactorial in setting of volume overload and asthma exacerbation, however acute diastolic heart failure was major contributing factor. Although he was given ampicillin and has a history of penicillin allergy, it is very unlikely this contributed to his shortness of breath given that he had not had ampicillin for over a week prior to presentation. He appeared significantly volume overloaded on admission with vascular engorgement on CXR consistent with CHF and JVP of 11-12cm therefore diuresis was initiated with TID IV lasix. He had excellent urine output, diuresing greater than 8L per day for several days. A TTE was unable to be performed due to body habitus, therefore EF is unknown, but patient likely has acute on chronic diastolic heart failure. He was discharged on 80mg oral lasix. Of note he had previously been on lasix and self-discontinued because of what he believed to be excessive urination. Patient was re-educated on symtpoms and management of heart failure and agreed to reinitiate this medication. His dyspnea had improved at the time of discharge and he was satting well on room air. Patient will hopefully have continued diuresis with net fluid losses over the next several weeks as an outpatient. . # CAD: Patient ruled in for NSTEMI with positive cardiac enzymes in the setting of heart failure. Patient denied chest pain or discomfort. Although heparin was started in ED, he was insistent that it be stopped. Patient not a candidate for cardiac catheterization at this time due to morbid obesity therefore he was medically managed with aspirin, plavix, beta blocker and statin. His risk factors need to be aggressively modified including blood sugar control, blood pressure control, as well as increased physical activity and weight loss, if possible. . # HTN: Sub-optimal control throughout entire admission although slight improvement with uptitration of medications. He was continued labetalol which was increased to maximum dose of 800mg BID. He was continued on maximal doses of norvasc and HCTZ. Lisinopril was increased to 60mg daily . # UTI: Urinalysis consistent with infection, culture unfortunately not performed. He was started on bactrim (day 1 = ___ and should complete a 14 day course . # ? Drug reaction: Patient likely had allergic reaction to ampicillin however exposure was greater than 1 week prior to admission and rash was resolving at time of admission. Patient was given solumedrol in ED given history of penicillin allergy, but not continued on steroids wduring admission. . # ARF: Unclear if CKD or ARF given baseline creatinine unknown. He has multiple risk factors for chronic kidney disease including diabetes and hypertension. This remained stable despite aggressive diuresis. . # DM: Poorly controlled at baseline and was not optimally controlled while inpatient. He was continued on 70\/30 insulin and the dose was uptitrated to 75 units ___ and 110 units in AM . # Dyslipidemia: His LDL was in the ___'s therefore he was maintained on low dose statin . # ___ edema: Patient has significant lower extremity edema to the sacrum likely from total body volume overload secondary to heart failure as well as chronic venous stasis.

MRI demonstrates the clinically suspected stroke in the left-mid precentral gyrus. Her deficits on exam were lower facial weakness (UMN), mild dysarthria, and mild clumsiness and slowing of FFM as well as orbiting deficit, and these have improved and are barely noticeable now. TTE demonstrated HOCM, MAC, a small mobile mass (differential thrombus vs tumor), and new pulmonary hypertension. In light of these TTE findings, have started warfarin, and pt will be discharged on 5 mg daily. She has been set up for outpt ATC f\/u. Ms. ___ was maintained on continuous cardiac telemetery. During this admission she had one episode 20-beat of asymptomatic monomorphic VTach and other shorter runs. Pt has HOCM and is thus predisposed to cardiac arrhythmias. This was discussed with cardiology, no further recs. Ms. ___ blood pressure was difficult to control during this admission. She had a predictable am spike in SBP to approx. 200 with good control afterwards on a regimen of metoprolol 12.5 mg q6h and amlodipine 5 mg daily.

Based on this history and your neurological exam, we obtained an MRI of your brain, which confirmed that you had a stroke. We obtained an echo (ultrasound) of your heart to look for a possible cause of a stroke. This showed a mass in your heart. This is likely a blood clot but it is possible that it is a tumor in your heart. Because of this, we started you on a blood thinner medication called warfarin (Coumadin). You will need to take this medication every day, and have blood levels checked on a number called INR. We have arranged follow-up in the ___ clinic for you. You will need to have another echo in one month to assess what has happened to the blood clot. Over the course of this hospitalization your weakness and other difficulties improved. We expect your deficits from your stroke to continue to improve over the next months. The echo of your heart also showed that you have a condition called HOCM (hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy). This means that there is an obstruction to the blood flow out of the heart. I believe your cardiologist was already aware of this. Because the outflow tract gradient was high, and because your blood pressure was high during this hospitalization, we made some changes to your blood pressure medications, and we will discharge you on metoprolol 100 mg every evening and amlodipine 5 mg daily.

{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: This ___ year old ___ speaking female was admitted on ___ for difficulty in speech and discharged on ___. 1. Home medication overdose, which led to bradycardia, relative hypotension, and dysarthria. As mentioned in HPI, patient received 0.5 mg atropine and calcium carbonate and responded with transient improvement of her bradycardia. Her home medication Cartia XT and lisinopril were held. It is unclear if the extra small pills that she took were lisinopril or aspirin, but it was certain that she took extra Cartia XT. She was also supported with IVF. Her HR, BP, and dysarthria gradually improved during the remainder of her hospital stay. Her serial neurological exam was without focal findings. Her blood sugar was monitored closely as overdose of calcium channel blocker can lead to inhibition of insulin release (hyperglycemia after OD is a poor prognostic indicator). Her blood sugar remained below 200. Her vital signs remained stable, and patient was discharged with instruction to restart her lisinopril and Cartia XT on the day after discharge. Home services were arranged to assist patient in medication arrangement as well as physical therapy. This should be followed up by her primary care physician. 2. Acute vs. chronic kidney disease. Crt was found to be elevated at 1.6 as compared to 1.2 in ___. Unclear if this is chronic or acute given her length of stay since there is no data point between ___ and ___. However, she did receive IV fluid (NS) for presumed pre-renal state as a result of the hypoperfusion state secondary to Cartia XT and possible lisinopril OD. This can be further evaluated by patient's primary care doctor. 3. Thyroid goiter. This is an incidental finding on chest X-ray. Patient has no known history of goiter, but this likely has been present for some time. Given the likely chronic nature of the goiter, this can be further evaluated by patient's primary physician in the outpatient setting. 4. Hyperkalemia, likely secondary to overdose of home medication and poor forward flow. This resolved with treatment (D50, 10 units of regular insulin, 30 g of Kayexelate, 2L IVF) from the emergency department and holding of her home medications. EKG did not show changes typical of hyperkalemia. This can be followed up by patient's primary care physician. 5. Fall, witnessed. During the hospital stay, patient's health aid reported that patient was sitting on the side of the bed and slipped slowly to the floor. The aid was able to catch and support patient and lower her to the floor (hips on the ground). Thus, patient was unharmed. She did not hit her head or lose consciousness. She denied any pain, tenderness, dizziness\/lightheadedness, chest pain, palpitation. Her physical exam after the incident was unremarkable and essentially the same as prior. Her neurological exam was also unchanged. No further work-up was done. She was instructed to get out of bed and ambulate with assist only. Physical therapy also recommended home ___.

Patient improved without further intervention and CIWA was discontinued. Patient was maintained on multivitamins, folate, and thiamine. Social work was consulted for relapse prevention as well as placement. Physical therapy worked with the patient as well. # DIARRHEA: Patient presented with diarrhea followed by constipation and then diarrhea again. Infectious studies were sent on stool, which were negative for SSYCE. Also sent for cdiff, which was positive. Patient was started on PO flagyl for a 2 week course (to complete treatment on ___.

Low dose labetolol was initiated with plan for outpatient follow up. # TACHYCARDIA: Patient was tachycardic to the 120s on arrival, likely related to alcohol and alcohol withdrawal. This improved as patient stopped scoring on CIWA. In addition, patient's home diltiazem was uptitrated to 240 daily. Patient remained persistently tachycardic \/ borderline tachycardic for the remainder of the hospitalization. This was attributed to pain, anxiety, as well as chronic liver disease with low right sided filling pressures. Patient remained asymptomatic.

{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: ___ female with a past medical history significant for newly diagnosed metastatic thyroid cancer, panic disorder with agoraphobia, depression, psychosis, near-complete refusal of preventative care, obesity, and chronic pain. She was recently discharged (___) after being admitted for pain control and for bone biopsy under anesthesia, admitted again for further pain management, found to have unstable C-spine in setting of mass compression. #Metastatic thyroid cancer #C-5 metastatic lesion\/pathologic fracture: Biopsy from her iliac bone from her last admission demonstrated Hurthle cell thyroid carcinoma. MRI obtained ___ showed effacement of C5 and C5 pathological compression fracture as well as multiple calvarian brain mets. She has L hand numbness\/weakness thought to be a consequence of the brain lesion vs. the cervical spinal lesion. Per rad onc, the C5 area is very precarious and radiation without surgical stabilization first could cause fracture and\/or paralysis. She was started on IV dexamethasone 4mg q6h which was switched to PO on discharge. We had many detailed discussions with the patient and her husband with neurosurgery, rad-onc, palliative care, ___, and medicine teams in which patient and husband were informed about the risks and benefits of cervical stabilization surgery, radiation vs comfort care. The patient understands that if she leaves the hospital without surgical stabilization of the cervical spine, she is at risk of c-spine fracture, paralysis, and death. The patient understands these risks and would like to leave the hospital to enjoy this time with her family and discuss with them to make a decision about her treatment moving forward. She understands that there really are two options 1. Surgical stabilization of the cervical spine followed by radiation therapy vs. 2. A more palliative, comfort focused approach. She has been consistent throughout all of these meetings in her absolute refusal to proceed with any surgical intervention. Per the ___ team, further management of her widely metastatic carcinoma would include thyroidectomy surgery and thyroid suppression. Either way, in order to pursue more aggressive treatment, she would need to first proceed with extensive C-spine stabilization surgery. Pt and husband expressed understanding of her difficult situation and precarious cervical spine. However, they did not feel ready to have hospice come into their home and wanted to first discuss her situation with her sons and extended family. We have set up ___ services with the plan for bridge to hospice when she feels they are ready. She will follow up with Dr. ___ (appointment pending), palliative care (appointment pending), and pending further discussions, rad\/onc and\/or neurosurgery as well. # CHRONIC PAIN ___ METASTATIC DISEASE Patient was recently admitted (discharged on ___ for pain management & inpatient biopsy under anesthesia from ___ to ___. During this admission her home Oxycontin was increased from 10 mg to 20mg BID and she was continued on PRN oxycodone. Palliative care also met with patient to assist with pain control and goals of care discussions. She was admitted this admission due to uncontrolled pain on that regimen. Palliative care was involved the entire time. We initially tried a PCA pump of dilaudid, which was not effective because the patient was not pressing the button enough due to anxiety about overdosing. We then switched her back to all oral pain medications, replacing some prn doses with standing doses, which resulted in excellent pain control for the patient without her having to worry too much about asking for prn's. On discharge, the patient feels almost completely pain free, even when up walking around with ___. It seems that the patient gets confused about prn doses and does much better with higher doses of standing doses. The patient preferred that we kept the regimen exactly the same for discharge. We have also outlined above the exact times she should take all of her medications to simplify it for her. This regimen is: - Oxycontin 30mg TID - Oxycodone 10mg q6h standing - Oxycodone 10mg q4h prn breakthrough pain (has not used) - Gabapentin 300mg PO TID - Acetaminophen 650mg Q6hrs standing # CHRONIC MICROCYTIC ANEMIA # HISTORY OF ___ DEFICIENCY Patient has a history of anemia (likely multifactorial in setting of ___ deficiency and anemia of chronic disease in setting of malignancy). It has downtrended during this admission, with Hb low of 6.3. There were no signs of active bleeding. Patient declined blood transfusion as she has always declined in the past. There is likely a component of iron-deficiency given ferritin of 17 in setting of extensive disease. She was given IV ferric gluconate 125mg x 2 days. PO ferrous sulfate 325mg BID was held due to concern for GI side effects. Can consider restarting as outpatient. # HYPERKALEMIA K elevated to 6.0 on ___. Gave calcium, insulin, and dextrose with decline of K to 4.3. Ace-inhibitor was stopped and renal function remained stable with mild CKD. Potassium on discharge was 5.0. We suspect there is a component of hemolyzing, as she had many blood draws with mildly elevated potassium in the morning and the whole blood potassium recheck returned within normal range without any intervention. # Depression, anxiety, psychosis: Patient endorses panic attacks and trauma associated with hospitals. She gets very anxious about bad news. We continued her home sertraline, seroquel, and valium. Her anxiety also improved significantly with pain control as well. The Paient was in communication with her psychiatrist Dr. ___ while in hospital. Per patient's request, the team initially told the patient's husband about any big news first, and allowed him to relay it to her in a more \"gentle\" way. However, as time went by, the patient came more to terms with the fact that she has cancer and is now more accepting of news about her cancer. On discharge, patient is aware of the state of her disease (thyroid carcinoma with full body mets), the risks of leaving the hospital without surgical stabilization of her spine (which include paralysis and death), and her treatment options (palliative vs surgery\/radiation). CHRONIC MEDICAL PROBLEMS ======================== # HYPERTENSION Patient has a known history of hypertension treated with lisinopril. However, her lisinopril was again held due to hyperkalemia (see above). We will hold her lisinopril for now especially given her normotension and it should be re-evaluated as outpatient. # HLD: Continued home statin and aspirin # COPD: Continued home advair and albuterol # GERD: Increased home omeprazole to 40mg daily due to initiation of Decadron (see problem 1 above) TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: =================== -Discharge labs: K 5.0, Hb 6.3, Cr 1.4 -NEW MEDICATIONS: Dexamethasone 4mg q6h, Bisacodyl 10 mg PO BID:PRN Constipation -CHANGED MEDICATIONS: Omeprazole 20mg daily to 40mg daily, Oxycontin 20mg BID to 30mg TID, Oxycodone q3h prn breakthrough to Oxycodone 10mg q6h standing with 10mg q4h prn breakthrough. -STOPPED MEDICATIONS: Lisinopril, Ferrous Sulfate 325 mg PO BID -Specialist followup: palliative care, heme-onc, and pending further discussions: rad-onc +\/- neurosurgery\/spine [ ] Consider tapering decadron as outpatient [ ] We increased her omeprazole to 40 mg daily from 20 mg daily given her steroid dosing [ ] Consider adding back PO iron [ ] Monitor Hb and K [ ] monitor pain control and adjust as tolerated.

In emergency department, computed tomography angiogram (CTA) showed no pulmonary embolism which can be life threatening. The cardiac enzyme and electrocardiogram did not show acute ischemia of your heart. We believe your atypical chest pain is likely due to musculoskeletal or gastroesophageal reflux symptoms. We started prilosec (omeprazole) for acid reflux and you can continue taking tylenol (acetaminophen) for costochondritis. The presence of jaw pain, however, is somewhat concerning for a heart problem. We recommend a stress echo test of the heart to rule out this possible cause of your symptoms."}

{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: On admission to ___, the patient received an upper endoscopy with clips and epinephrine injection, and was monitored in the ICU. Clopidogrel was stopped. After leaving the ICU, he has a ureteral stent placed by radiology, and was transferred to the floor. On the floor, he continued to have diarrhea. C diff was positive. GI was consulted, who recommended starting PO vancomycin and continuing to hold budesonide until he was further evaluated by his outpatient cardiologist. In the setting of diarrhea, a troponin was checked, and found to be elevated to 0.05 (repeat troponins ranged between 0.05 and 0.09), and an EKG showed new T-wave inversions in V1-V3. The patient was asymptomatic and able to climb multiple flights of stairs without symptoms. Cardiology reviewed his case, and given high risk of rebleeding from his ulcer with a cardiac catheterization or further DAPT , it was determined that patient would follow up with his outpatient cardiologist on ___ (though I requested he maker a sooner appointment) for further risk stratification. The patient was counseled that he should report to the ER with any cardiac symptoms, or a return of his nausea and vomiting. 1. UGIB. The patient will follow up with gastroenterology in 2 weeks for a repeat endoscopy with biopsy. In the meantime, he is being discharged on pantoprazole BID. An H pylori is pending. 2. Recurrent C Diff diarrhea 3. Microscopic colitis Unclear to what extent the patient is colonized versus infected, and his diarrhea did get worse after stopping budesonide. ID was consulted, and he was started on PO vancomycin. He will continue this as an outpatient until he sees his outpatient gastroenterologist, who will make a decision to taper versus restarting budesonide. At that time, he should also be considered for a repeat colonoscopy. 4. CAD 5. NSTEMI (likely demand ischemia) The patient did not complain of cardiac symptoms during his hospitalization. However, on HD#3 he did complain of some nausea, and a troponin was sent (0.05). An EKG showed TWIs in V1-V3, new since ___. His troponin did not clear during his hospitalization (0.09 on discharge). I discussed his case and reviewed with cardiology. This most likely represents demand ischemia (T2NSTEMI). Given no unstable symptoms (in fact no symptoms at all), patient would not currently be a candidate for angiography given his high risk of rebleed if stent placement was necessary. This was discussed with the patient, and in lieu of waiting in the hospital, he elected to discharge home with outpatient follow up with his cardiologist (scheduled on ___, but patient will try to push up appointment). He was instructed to return to the emergency room if he developed any symptoms of chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, or vomiting. He was discharged on aspirin, lisinopril, and metoprolol, and clopidogrel was stopped. 6. Ureteral stone. Patient had a cystoscopy and left ureteral stent placed on ___. He will follow up as an outpatient with urology for definitive treatment. He was discharged on tamsulosin and pyridium as needed, and a lidocaine patch for comfort. 7. Anxiety: Patient was continued on home trazodone 50 mg PO QHS PRN insomnia and bupropion SR 150 mg PO BID.

This was treated with clips and an injection of epinephrine. You were started on a medicine called a proton pump inhibitor (pantoprazole) to treat the ulcer. You will need to take this twice a day. The ulcer was likely caused by your heart medications aspirin and Plavix (clopidogrel). You should stop your clopidogrel (Plavix). You will need to see your gastroenterologist in ___ weeks for a repeat endoscopy, to see how the ulcer is healing, and also to take a biopsy to look for infection or cancer. We also diagnosed you with cdiff colitis; it is unclear whether this is your microscopic colitis or an active infection. In any event, you will be treated with vancomycin until you see your gastroenterologist, who will make a decision regarding continuing a taper of your vancomycin and restarting your budesonide. You also had a ureteral stone treated with ureteral stent with urology and you will need f\/u for this. Finally, a troponin (cardiac enzyme) was checked while you were in the hospital, and it was mildly positive. I checked an EKG that showed new signs of potentially a small heart attack.

{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: SUMMARY: ___ with history of gastric bypass and prior anastamotic ulcer, admitted with melena and severe anemia (H\/H of ___, found to have large, ~3cm marginal ulcer at G-J anastamosis on EGD. The ulcer was injected with epinephrine and cauterized with achievement of hemostasis. The patient had no more bleeding episodes while inpatient and remained hemodynamically stable. He was kept on high dose PPI throughout his stay. He will need a repeat endoscopy in 10 weeks and should follow up with his bariatric surgeon. # Upper GIB due to ulcer: Melena and h\/o marginal ulcer are most suggestive of upper GI bleed as cause of patient's profound anemia.

{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: This ___ year-old male with multiple medical problems including insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease status post lower extremity vascular grafts, grangrenous infections and above the knee amputation, renal transplant, and history of UTIs and urosepsis who presented with fatigue, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and fever. # Fever: The patient had a temperature 102.7 F at home on day of admission, and has been afebrile besides a temperature of 100.7 F. The differential considered for this was his urinary tract infection (UTI), bacteremia, pneumonia, wound infections, cellulitis or osteomyelitis. His UTI was treated with ciprofloxacin. His blood cultures showed no growth to date. Two chest x-rays were negative for pneumonia. There were no apparent infections of wounds or ulcerating lesions. The patient did, however, have left lower leg cellulitis, which may have responded to broad empiric antibiotic for the UTI using linezolid and ciprofloxacin. He was continued on his daily dosing of his Bactrim prophylactic dose, which may be treating his cellulitis to some extent. The patient had significant long-standing pain in his left knee. X-ray of the knee only revealed arthritis. Further work-up of osteomyelitis was deemed unwarranted. Patient was afebrile after the second day of his inpatient stay and remained so throughout. # UTI: The patient has a urinalysis positive for many bacteria that were identified on culture as Proteus Mirabilis sensitive to ciprofloxacin. This was initially empirically treated with ciprofloxacin and linezolid to cover gram-negative rods and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE), which this patient has had before. When cultures returned positive for Proteus linezolid was discontinued, and ciprofloxacin HCl 750 PO q24h was continued for a 14-day course. Ultrasound did not reveal abscesses of the renal transplant. This is the patient's first urinary tract infection occurring without a Foley catheter in place. He may have been predisposed to this because of his benign prostatic hypertrophy. We recommended follow-up with his PCP regarding this, with potentially reevaluation by urology. # Acute Renal Failure: The patient had a creatinine (Cr) increase to 4.2 from a recent baseline of 2.2, but is trending down here (3.9,3.7,3.2 to 2.8) after fluid bolusing and intermittent IV fluid administration. Given this patients recent poor PO intake and continuation of thiazide and furosemide diuretics, he was likely in pre-renal failure. The FeUrea of 26 confirmed his prerenal state. There may be an intrinsic component to his renal failure such as ATN. This can be further evaluated if the patient's Cr does not return to baseline. Lasix and Metolazone were not restarted prior to discharge but should be addressed prior to discharge from rehab. # End-stage renal disease with renal transplant - A renal ultrasound suggested that his transplant kidney was well-perfused. The Cr increase was likely prerenal failure although intrinsic renal failure is also possible. His rapamycin level was found to be in the therapeutic range. He was continued on Mycophenolate Mofetil 250 mg PO BID, PredniSONE 3 mg PO DAILY, Sirolimus (rapamycin) 3 mg PO HS, Sulfameth\/Trimethoprim DS 1 TAB PO QMOWEFR for prophylaxis, and Doxercalciferol 2.5 mcg PO DAILY. Epoetin Alfa was increased to 8000 UNIT Q 5 days. Ferrous Sulfate 325 mg PO DAILY was held given the potential of Fe to cause nausea. His Mycophenolate (CellCept) dose was decreased to 250mg BID, as this was also potentially contributing to his nausea. His rapamycin level was found to be therapeutic upon admission and throughout his admission. The patient has a scheduled follow-up appointment with Dr. ___ nephrologist. # Nausea & Anorexia: The etiology of this patient's nausea is unclear, but may be multifactorial. He was in acute renal failure, and his urema may be contributing. Additionally, he is ill from his UTI. His iron supplement and mycophenolate may also contribute to nausea. The patient has also previously been anorectic with unclear etiology that responded to antidepressants and mirtazapine. During this hospital stay, the patient's appetite was decreased but a tolerated Boost drinks. His nausea was treated compazine. His UTI was treated as indicated above. He was rehydrated for his prerenal failure and his Cr trended down. His iron supplementation was held. His CellCept (mycophenolate) dose was decreased to 250mg BID, as the renal team felt that his transplant was longstanding and did not require higher dosing of this medication. The patient was also restarted on mirtazapine. Iron should be restarted once tolerating better oral intake. # Respiratory: The patient was admitted with a cough and an oxygen requirement. His chest x-ray was negative for pneumonia. The patient also complained of malaise. Viral respiratory panel test was sent, which was negative for influenza and other respiratory viruses. Because the patient was initially febrile and had some leg swelling, ___ was performed, which was negative. His oxygen requirement did not significantly change, and physical therapy found that his oxygenation was stable with activity. He was successfully weaned to room air and did not require supplementation upon discharge. # Left lower extremity erythema: The patient described his erythema and crusting as long-standing. The erythema, however, improved on ciprofloxacin and linezolid. After discontinuing linezolid, the patient's Sulfameth\/Trimethoprim dose was changed to single strength daily for prophylaxis and further treatment of cellulitis was not pursued. # Pressure ulcers: The patient has a pressure ulcer over right buttock and new skin breakdown over his lateral right lower extremity likely secondary to immobility. Lesions are without induration, tenderness to palpation, or fluctuance. The patient was moved out of bed to his chair at least daily to prevent progression of these lesions. They were monitored daily and appropriately dressed. These should continue to be monitored by rehab staff with dressings as appropriate. # Depression: Patient confirms mood has been 'sour' for ___ years and that he has little motivation, and little interest in daily activities. He was on Remeron (mirtazapine) in the past with some improvement and discontinued it because he felt better. The patient was restarted on Remeron 15mg QHS and Citalopram 10mg daily. # Diabetes Mellitus: The patient's blood glucose level was monitored throughout his hospitalization, with good control. The patient takes 60U Lantus qhs at home but uses half the dose at home when his food intake is poor. Given his nausea and poor PO intake, we initially maintained him on Lantus 30U qhs with minimal use of the insulin sliding scale. This was increased to 50U daily with advancing of this diet. # Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure was elevated early during the hospitalization. His dose of Metoprolol Tartrate 75 mg PO to BID was increased to 100mg TID dosing. He was continued on Amlodipine 10 mg PO DAILY. Hydralazine was also added given continued hypertension. Upon discharge his SBP was approximately 140. Lasix and Metolazone were continued to be held as above. # Vascular disease: The patient had no problems directly related to his vascular disease. He was maintained on his outpatient regimen of Aspirin 81 mg PO DAILY, Niacin SR 500 mg PO HS, and Atorvastatin 40 mg PO DAILY. # Osteoarthritis: The patient initially reported pain all over his body that was likely consistent with malaise. His knee pain was ___ but reportedly at his baseline. His pain was managed with Percocet and Dilaudid, and improved throughout the hospital stay. A knee XR confirmed tricompartmental arthritis. ESR 97 and CRP>300 did raise the concern for infectious or rheumatologic process. There was no remark of osteomyelitis on knee x-ray, which should be apparent in long-standing osteomyelitis. We recommend outpatient rheumatology evaluation for this patient. # Benign prostatic hypertrophy: The patient had a Foley placed in the emergency department, but this was removed soon after arrival on the floor. He was able to urinate throughout his hospitalization without issues. It is unclear why the patient is on 2 alpha-blocker medications but one may be for his hypertension. He was continued on Doxazosin 2 mg PO HS and Tamsulosin 0.4 mg PO HS. He had no symptoms of hypotension during this admission. The patient's prostate enlargement may have contributed to his urinary tract infection. We recommend outpatient evaluation by urology for possible post-void residual urine that may be contributing to a predisposition for UTIs. # Diastolic heart dysfunction: The patient was continued on his outpatient regimen of Isosorbide Mononitrate (Extended Release) 90 mg PO DAILY. Lasix and metolazone were held given the patient's prerenal state on admission. # Constipation: The patient was initially constipated and developed lower abdominal pain that resolved after initiation of a bowel regimen. # Anemia: The patient's hematocrit was approximately 30 throughout the admission, with a baseline range of mid-20s to mid-30s. Anemia workup in ___ low TIBC, low TRF, low Fe, normal Ferritin, and high haptoglobin. His high haptoglobin may have been an inflammatory marker. The patient's erythropoietin dose was increased to 8000 units. Iron supplementation was held because of the patient's nausea. Prophylaxis: Pantoprazole; and heparin 5000U SC for DVT PPX Dispo - Physical therapy evaluated the patient and found him to be significantly deconditioned, requiring rehabilitation. CODE - FULL (confirmed with patient) Communication - We communicated with the patient's wife regularly at the following home number. ___","summary":"You were admitted because of your fever, nausea, vomiting, and fatigue. You were found to have a urinary tract infection. This was treated with an antibiotic called ciprofloxacin. Your dehydration resulted in decreased function of your kidney transplant. We temporarily stopped your water pills (Lasix & Zaroxolyn) and your kidney kidney function improved after giving you IV fluids. Your Lasix and Zaroxolyn were not restarted prior to your discharge. This may be restarted at your rehab if your volume status and oral intake improve. We think your nausea was a result of this decreased kidney function in addition to some of your medications that can cause nausea. We held your iron supplementation and decreased the dose of your CellCept to 250mg twice per day because both of these medications can increase nausea. Please continue these changes as an outpatient.

She was diagnosed with alzhemers by her neurologist prior to admission. In house a paxil trial has attempted, to see if depression treatement would improve mental status. No improvement was seen and paxil was later d\/ced for fear that in was overly sedating. Imaging showed She has extensive atrophy of her medial temporal lobes and hippocampus. She also has extensive regions of brain infarction and leukoencephalopathy both frontally and cerebellar. Neuro was consulted for management and evaluation for possible communicating hydrocephalus. Per neuro the hydrocephalus is explained by two preocesses- 1) ex vacuo due to atrophy and infarction of brain tissue and 2) loss of white matter firmness and support leads to further ventricular enlargement. These processes are not improved by shunting which carries a substantial risk. Neuro strongly favored not performing an LP or considering placement of a shunt. Secondly, her history of sedatives before MRI leading to profound hypotension is another risk that may outweigh any benefit. .

Based on these findings, the patient's clinical improvement, and his ongoing ascites, surgery decided to hold off on a bypass at this time and see him in follow up as an outpatient. # Ascites Per hepatology evaluation, ascites seems to be multifactorial due to portal hypertension due to the obliteration of his portal vein and encasement of his SMA\/SMV by his tumor, as well as obstruction of his lymph system contributing to chylous nature of the ascites. The liver is unlikely cirrhotic given normal LFTs, synthetic function and non-cirrhotic appearance on OSH CT scan. For the concern for chylous ascites (based on patient's description) as well as overall malnutrition, he was seen by nutrition, who recommended a low fat, sodium restricted diet with ensure enlive supplements mixed with beneprotein and 15 mL medium chain triglycerides oil. A triene\/tetraene ratio was also checked with results pending on discharge; if> 0.4 and s\/sx of deficiency consider parenteral fat emulsion. He had a paracentesis on the day of discharge, both therapeutic on schedule for his weekly tap and also diagnostic to evaluate for chylous ascites. Also continued home Lasix 10 mg daily while inpatient.","summary":"You were admitted to the hospital with nausea\/vomiting and found to have a small bowel obstruction due to your pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor.

{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: Mr ___ is an ___ man with history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, chronic renal insufficiency, presenting with syncope and found to have STEMI. . # Sycope: The cause of his sycope on presentation was thought to be most likely orthostatic hypotension with cerebral hypoperfusion given his cerebrovascular disease. Carotid ultrasound showed 40-59% stenosis of the internal carotid arteries bilaterally. He had no further syncopal episodes while in house. . # STEMI: Patient initially had positive enyzmes and ST elevations v2-v6. He was given ASA, Plavix, Beta blocker, heparin gtt. He was prehydrated for catheterization. . On ___, repeat EKG showed STE in lateral leads. Enzymes were trended and flat. Pt did not have symptoms. Decision was made to send pt to cardiac cath on ___, demonstrating severe 3 vessel disease. At that point, cardiac surg was consulted for CABG. However, during the morning of ___, pt complained of back pain and STE returned in his lateral leads. Patient was sent again to the cath lab for balloon pump and then transfer to the CCU. . In the ccu, the decision was made not to pursue CABG given multiple medical comorbidities. The patient remained free of chest pain. Medical management including clopidogrel, full dose aspirin, beta blocker, and high dose statin were undertaken. He was weaned off the intra-aortic balloon pump and it was removed. He had a femoral bruit, so US was done which showed no evidence of pseudoaneurysm. . Regarding his coronary disease, the plan was to wait until renal failure resolved and then consider repeat catheterization for revascularization of his LAD. He would need to have this done before any urologic procedure (as below). . # Acute on chronic renal insufficiency: Creatinine on admission was near baseline of 2. After catheterizations, creatinine rose to a high of 5.4. The most likely cause was contrast-induced ATN. He was hydrated, and renal function improved slowly. Creatinine on discharge was 3.2. . # GI bleed: In the CCU, the patient had guaiac positive stools and reported a history of melena. He was given pRBC to maintain Hct >28. GI did an upper endoscopy that showeed erosive gastritis and duodenitis, likely the source of bleeding. He was given BID PPI. Per GI, this would not preclude heparinization for cardiac procedure if needed. . # Renal mass: On non-contrast abdominal CT, patient was found to have a 4 cm L renal mass that was confirmed by ultrasound to be solid. The urology team evaluated the patient and recommended outpatient follow-up for MR with gadolinium after renal function improves. After speaking with his nephrologist (Dr. ___ at ___, he should NOT get MR with gadolinium at any point but should instead have a contrast CT after kidney function improves. He could potentially undergo resection, after LAD is revascularized, if the disease is localized. . # Mild Chronic Systolic heart Failure: Echo from outside hospital showed overall mildly depressed EF of 40-45% but with focal wall motion abnormality. He was on lasix as an outpatient which was held because of acute renal failure. On discharge, he will need to have daily weights and reinstitution of diuretics as needed. . # Hypertension: The patient had a history of chronic hypertension, likely exacerbated by not taking his clonidine the morning of admission. He initially received a nitro drip, transitioning to hydralazine and later to home medications including beta blocker, amlodipine, and clonidine (changed from tablet to patch). Lisinopril was held for renal failure. He was normotensive on this regimen. . # Left orbital edema: The patient had left orbital edema on admission. Head CT at ___ negative for fracture, no point tenderness on exam. The edema resolved within days. . # Leukocytosis: The patient briefly developed leukocytosis. CXR showed a possible L lower lobe infiltrate. He was afebrile and asymptomatic, and the leukocytosis resolved within days. The most likely cause was aspiration pneumonitis. He should be observed while eating until his mental status improves to baseline. . # Hypernatremia: Sodium the day of discharge was slightly elevated at 148. This will need to be followed at the rehab facility.","summary":"You were admitted to the hospital because you passed out. You were found to have a heart attack.

Her pain was initially controlled with IV dilaudid, although the medication made her quite drowsy. She was converted to PO dilaudid prior to discharge and was kept on stool softeners while taking opioids. She was started on gabapentin, which was titrated up to 300mg TID by the time of discharge. She was also given lidocaine jelly to apply over the painful areas. It was felt that capsaicin would not be a good idea considering the degree of her pain. Her itching was controlled with Benadryl and Atarax at first, and then Eucerin cream was added. She was discharged with Eucerin cream and instructions to take Benadryl or Atarax as needed. . # Hypertension: On admission she was hyponatremic, thought to be due to a combination of pain and her HCTZ.
