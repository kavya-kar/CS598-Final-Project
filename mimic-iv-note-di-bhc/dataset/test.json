{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: Mr. ___ is a ___ year old male with a history of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and hypothyroidism who presented with constipation. . ACTIVE ISSUES BY PROBLEM: # Constipation: Constipation was likely multifactorial: secondary to volume depletion (secondary to osmotic diuresis from hyperglycemia), hyperglycemia (which can produce mild ileus), poor compliance with thyroid medication and possible underlying diabetic autonomic neuropathy. Patient admitted to not taking levothyroxine in a week. Serum TSH was elevated at 4.6. We re-started levothyroxine. Bowel movement was achieved after colace, miralax and 2 fleet enemas. We spoke with son, who visits father intermittently, and advised him to visit more often and encourage adherence to medication regimen. We also arranged for ___ services to re-start on his return home to assist with medication compliance. Finally, we spoke with his ___ PCP who will arrange outpatient appointment with clinical pharmacist for patient education on medication regimen. . # Diabetes mellitus, type 2: Patient presented with glucose of 477, mild acidosis and anion gap of 12 (with lactate of 2.1). He also had positive ketones in his urine. He received 10U humalog in ED and 20 U of 75\/25 on the floor, which brought his glucose to 289. On the floor, patient's insulin dosing was according to his home regimen. On the day of discharge, his blood sugars were between 129 and 151 with no evidence of anion-gap or acidosis. Hyperglycemia was likely because of poor compliance with medication. Patient reports less than strict observance of insulin dosing. We consulted nutrition who visited patient and educated on proper diabetic diet. We also arranged for ___ services on discharge as above. We discussed the dangers of poor glycemic control and the patient was able to answers questions later indicating understanding. . # Hyponatremia: On admission, sodium of 120 which corrected to 126 with glucose of 477. Likely etiology was volume depletion from osmotic diuresis due to hyperglycemia as well as contribution of pseudohyponatremia secondary to hyperglcemia. Improved with IVF fluids and better management of sugars. We encouraged patient to maintain strong oral intake at home. . # Acute on chronic kidney injury (AoCKD): Upon admission, he had a Cr of 2.7 and FeNa of 2.7%. There may have been some element of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) secondary to hypoperfusion from dehydration. Cr was 2.8 on discharge. Underlying kidney disease is presumed to be from diabetic and hypertensive nephropathy. . # Hypertension: Lisinopril was held initially due to AoCKD but re-started on ___. Atenolol 25 mg QD was continued throughout admission and on discharge with good control. . # Hypothyroidism: Serum TSH of 4.6 found on admission. We continued levothyroxine 75 mcg QD and encouraged patient to comply with medication. . CHRONIC PROBLEMS BY ISSUE: # Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD): Continued omeprazole 20 mg qday . # Coronary artery disease: Continued aspirin 81 mg qday and lovastatin 40 mg qday. . TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: - Please make sure that the patient is adhering to his medication regimen - Please recheck serum electrolytes and TSH to assure that they are remaining well controlled.","summary":"You were admitted to the hospital because you were constipated.

In the ER, she was found to have bilateral infiltrates on CXR and hypoxia with delirium. # Pneumonia - Given delirium with oxygen requirement, CXR was performed which showed bilateral diffuse opacities. In addition to oxygen requirement, pt was intermittently tachycardic and complaining of right-sided chest wall pain, and so CTA was performed, which showed no pulmonary embolus (rather incomplete visualization of subsegmental pulmonary arteries secondary to external compression from focal pulmonary opacities), but did confirm the diffuse pulmonary opacities and pleural effusions, more indicative of multifocal infection rather than metastatic disease. A family meeting was held and the decision was made to focus on treatment of the infection empirically to hopefully help relieve some of the confusion rather than perform invasive procedures that may be potentially harmful. The pt was put on treatment for HCAP (given hospitalization in ___ with levofloxacin, vancomycin, and cefepime for a total 8 day course.

However, metastatic disease was not found, but instead multiple embolic infarcts. She had been on Lovenox since admission, which was listed as a home medication (though unclear if pt was taking this at home) and continued upon discharge. # Goals of care - Family meeting was held (as stated above) to discuss radiographic findings on this admission. Disease progression was made known to the patient and her family. Decision was made to avoid other\/invasive procedures (i.e. bronchoscoy, echocardiogram) in hopes that IV antibiotics will treat any current infection and help improve her delirium. Please note that her delirium may worsen if due to underlying disease progression (i.e. metastatic pancreatic cancer). # Metastatic pancreatic cancer with acute on chronic abdominal pain: Pt was started on MS CONTIN 15mg twice daily as well as oxycodone prn.

By history events do not sound clearly like typical epileptic seizures and are more consistent with non epileptic seizures or convulsive or vasovagal syncope. They occurred in the setting of stressor of death in the family and heavy alcohol use. She was monitored on EEG for 48 hours and no episodes were captured. Her interictal EEG background was normal. There was no suggestion of a predisposition for seizures. She also received ibuprofen and Tylenol for headache. She was briefly on levetiracetam, but this was not continued after the loading dose in the ER.","summary":"You were admitted to the Epilepsy service at ___ after having multiple events where you lost consciousness and fell. We monitoring you with an electroencephalogram (EEG). You did not have any episodes during the hospitalization but we were able to assess your baseline brain wave activity and it was normal. It did not show that you are at risk for having seizures. While this cannot say for sure that the events you had weren't seizures, it is unlikely that they were. More likely they were \"non-epileptic seizures\" which are events that look like seizures that often occur when people are stressed. They do not originate from abnormal brain activity. The treatment for this involves stress management and sometimes cognitive behavioral therapy to help control these events. Seizure medicines do no help. Since you lost consciousness recently, we recommend that you take precautions such as not swimming along, taking showers instead of baths, and not driving for at least 6 months (this is ___ law)."}

She appeared volume overloaded from the extra fluid given with IV Acyclovir to prevent nephrotoxicity. She initially improved with diuresis. She continued to have several episodes of respiratory distress despite adequate diuresis. She was maintained on supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula. Some of her tachypnea was attributed to a possible restrictive lung process given the presence of severe kyphosis and pleural plaques. She also had episodes of tachypnea that seemed to be anxiety provoked and responded to small doses of Ativan. Serial CXRs, however, showed increase in left sided pleural effusion. CT scan confirmed the increase in size of left pleural effusion and small loculated right sided pleural effusion, which was concerning for malignancy vs. CHF. Interventional Pulmonology was consulted for a left-sided thoracentesis, which was completed on ___. Over 1 L of serous fluid was drained. Pleural fluid analysis was consistent with a transudate, most likely secondary to the large amount of fluid administered in the ICU in the setting of a depressed EF (30%). She was successfully weaned off of supplemental oxygen prior to discharge.

Empiric Vancomycin, Cefepime and Ampicillin were started with concern for meningitis; Acyclovir was started empirically with cocnern for HSV encephalitis. She was given ativan 2 mg IV, loaded with Keppra 1500 mg x 1, and transferred to the Neuro-ICU. In the ICU, she was continued on Keppra 1000mg BID. She was extubated on ___. A troponin elevation to 0.17 was thought to be secondary to demand ischemia ___ seizure. Ampicillin was dicontinued on ___ Vancomycin\/Cefepime was discontinued on ___. She continued on Keppra 1000mg BID and Acyclovir 600 mg IV q8h. An LP was planned, but the patient INR was found to be elevated to 3.0, and she received Vitamin K. She was subsequently transferred to the Neurology floor. MRI\/MRV ruled out focal lesions predisposing to cortical hyper-excitability or obvious leptomeningeal disease from her lymphoma. An LP ultimately showed no evidence of infection. HSV was ruled out by CSF PCR. Cytology from the CSF was negative for malignant cells. EEG showed mild diffuse background slowing and intermittent bursts of diffuse delta activity which was noted to be indicative of a mild diffuse encephalopathy and was non-specific with regard to etiology. She remained seizure free since starting Keppra 1000 mg BID and was discharged on this regimen with neurology follow-up. # Acute on chronic systolic CHF: Patient with history of MR and Cardiomyopathy thought to be secondary to chemotherapy agent.

Patient was volume-overloaded after receiving large volumes of IV fluid, and was subsequently diuresed to dehydration with mild hypernatremia (Na 146) and contraction alkalosis. Her volume was replenished through oral rehydration. She was euvolemic upon discharge and was discharged on prn lasix for weight gain ___ edema as noted above. CHRONIC ISSUES: =============================== #Atrial Fibrillation: Patient was continued on Metoprolol Tartrate 25mg TID in place of long acting Metoprolol. This was downtitrated to 12.5 mg BID in the setting of recurrent episodes of asymptomatic bradycardia. Her anticoagulation was reversed for LP and then she was bridged with Lovenox back to a therapeutic INR. Her Coumadin was held for an INR < 2 to prepare for the thoracentesis, and was restarted on ___ once the chest tube was removed. # Diffuse Large B cell lymphoma: s\/p 4 cycles R-CHOP. PET scan in ___ showed low level metabolic activity associated with the residual upper left abdominal retroperitoneal adenopathy. Cytology from CSF showed no malignant cells. There were some enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes noted on chest CT. Patient's outside records were obtained from ___. Per these records, there were no active plans for chemotherapy until repeat PET scan was performed. #Hypertension: Continued home lisinopril Transitional Issues: =========================== [ ] metoprolol XL dose decreased to 25 mg daily on discharge - recommend continued monitoring of HR, may need dose up titration as outpatient. [ ] INR check ___ by ___ [ ] f\/u with neurology, continue keppra [ ] monitor weights as outpatient - may need addition of diuretic to maintain euvolemia [ ] monitor BPs - relatively stable as inpatient, but has occasional increases to 150s\/160s. No dose adjustment made at this time, recommend f\/u with PCP regarding optimization of BP meds.","summary":"Your were admitted after you began to have seizures at home. You initially needed to be cared for in the intensive care unit and had a tube to help you breath and protect your airway while you were seizing. You had some scans done of your brain which showed no strokes, bleeds or masses. Initially you were treated by the Neurology team for a possible infection in the brain. After you continued to improve, these antibiotics were discontinued as there was low suspicion that you had an infectious meningitis. We continued an antiviral medication until we could safely do a lumbar puncture (spinal tap) to completely rule out infection. The fluid from your spinal tap showed no evidence of infection and no cancerous cells. You were started on anti-seizure medication per the neurology team recommendations. When you were on the regular medicine floor you continued to have intermittent episodes where it was difficult for you to breath. You required supplemental oxygen and breathing treatments. A CT scan of the chest showed that there was fluid surrounding your left lung. We held your home dose of Coumadin in preparation for a procedure to drain the fluid (thoracentesis). You had this procedure performed by the Interventional Pulmonology team on ___, and it drained over 1 L of fluid from your chest. We gave you pain medications (Tylenol and oxycodone) because you developed pain at the site of the chest tube. Initial analysis of this fluid showed that it may have accumulated due to your heart failure and receiving large volumes of IV fluids. Your home dose of Coumadin was restarted after the chest tube was removed."}
{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: ___ with a PMH of dementia (AAOx2 at baseline), paroxysmal atrial fibrillation on coumadin and digoxin, who was sent in from ___ for vomiting and diarrhea. . Active Issues: # Diarrhea: The patient's stool tested c. diff negative (test with >90% sensitivity). On admission, patient with diarrhea (4x in 8 hours) and a WBC of 19.7. A WBC that high is usually suggestive of c. diff, however the CBC on admission appears to be spurious lab values given that all CBC quantities (WBC, hct, plts) dropped excessively on repeat and remained stable there after. Patient was empirically started on flagyl 500mg IV TID for a day, prior to c. diff coming back negative. It was then discontinued. Patient's repeat WBCs were within normal range (8.1 on day 2) and patient remained with occasionally low grade fevers (to 100.4). Within 2 days, patient's diarrheal output decreased and even ceased by the time of discharge. Of note ___ reports an outbreak of viral gastroenteritis, as well as an outbreak of c.diff, per report. The patient most likely has a viral gastroenteritis and this has resolved. She was given IVFs to rehydrate and returned to her nursing home once the diarrhea had resolved. . # Nausea: Patient was nauseous prior to arrival to the hospital, however once in the hospital, patient denies any nausea and was without episodes of vomiting. Symptoms were likely related to her gastrointestinal infection. Initially patient was maintained on sips, however diet was advanced to full once it was clear she had resolution of her symptoms. . # Tachycardia: Patient with paroxysmal afib on coumadin, metoprolol and digoxin (recently increased to 0.25mg daily). She was given extra metoprolol in the ED for an increased heart rate (120s). HR remained in the 100s-110s, but decreased initially with IVFs. Patient was monitored on telemetry and home metoprolol (25 TID), digoxin (0.25 daily) and warfarin 2.5mg daily were administered. INR ranged from 1.8-1.9 over admission. Patient sees cardiology as an outpatient and last recorded note mentions considering cardioversion if this continues 6wks out from her appointment. Heart rate was relatively well controlled (SBP 100s), so not further action was taken. . Chronic Issues: # DM: No recent HgbA1c in the system. Patient's metformin was held, glargine 10units Qhs was given and patient was covered with an HISS. ASA was also continued. . # HTN: continued home metoprolol and lisinopril.

The epidural was removed ___. On ___, an erector spinae catheter was placed by APS, she was given an aggressive bowel regimen and had a BM, and was transferred to the floor. On ___, the patient had an acute worsening of her respiratory status, thought to be multi-factorial with differential including splinting, COPD exacerbation, CHF exacerbation and pneumonia. She was transferred to the intensive care unit for respiratory monitoring and started on IV diuresis and antibiotics. Her respiratory status stabilized and she was weaned from supplemental oxygen to room air. She was also noted to have abdominal distension with KUB suggesting ileus, and NGT was placed with >1L feculent appearing output. During the course of her second ICU admission, Ms ___ was noted to have a pleural effusion that would likely require placement of a pigtail cathether in order to aid her respiratory distress. In conversation with the patient and her family members as well as with the palliative care service, the decision was made to avoid escalation of care and initiation of further procedures. Ultimately, the patient decided she would like to transition to completely comfort focused care. In keeping with her wishes, all preventative and non-comfort focused medicines and interventions were ceased.

In this setting the patient had chest pain and lateral ST depressions. She was replaced on the nitro drip with good bp response and resolution of the chest pain and EKG changes. She was placed on higher doses of nifedipine CR and labetalol with better bp control. She became hypotensive after dialysis and large bowel movements, thus labetalol was decreased to 100mg twice daily. Her long-acting nifedipine was also discontinued as it was felt that better titration could be achieved with short acting agents in the short term. She is being discharged on labetalol 100 bid.

However, patient developed a drug rash to Unasyn which had happened to her previously. Unasyn was changed to Vancomyin and Meropenem and the patient clinically improved with improvement in rash, reduced pain and swelling, resolution of fever, and normalization of white blood cell count.

DVT was ruled out with lower extremity duplex ultrasound. Arterial duplex studies were read preliminarily as normal with final read pending at discharge. #Tinea Pedis: It was felt that maceration between ___ and ___ toes due to tinea infection was the cause of the patient's cellulitis. Given the mildly elevated in aminotransferase levels (see below), the patient was instructed to discontinue topical terbinafine (which she had been taking prior to admission) and the patient was prescribed clotrimazole cream to take for at least a two week course with ultimate course to be determined by PCP as she may benefit from indefinite topical antifungals given her recurrent infections leading to severe cellulitis. Patient was instructed not to start antifungal cream until she has completed her Linezolid to avoid any drug-drug interactions. Patient was instructed to follow up with her PCP since if the fungal infection is not treated appropriately with topical medication, she may benefit from systemic therapy once she has completed her course of Linezolid. A1c was wnl. #Cough\/GERD: Patient experienced dry cough without shortness of breath during hospitalization which was felt to be due to GERD. She was started on PPI and was instructed to follow up with her PCP. #Transaminitis: The patient did not have liver chemistries checked on admission, but liver chemistries on the morning prior to initiation of Linezolid showed mild elevation in the ALT and AST with normal ALK and TB. It was felt this was most likely related to previous meropenem and unasyn use. As above, given that these labs were drawn prior to her first dose of Linezolid it was felt that the elevated liver chemistries were not due to Linezolid. The LFTs could potentially be due to topical terbinafine that the patient had been using prior to discharge, but this was felt to be less likely.

{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: A ___ woman with Type 1 diabetes mellitus recently discharged from ___ re-presents with episodes of vomiting and RUQ pain # Vomiting\/Abdominal Pain: Differential was concerning for retained stone versus SMA syndrome. Retained stone was ruled out given normal LFTs and normal MRCP. SMA syndrome was under consideration since the patient had lost weight over the past couple months and endorsed post-feeding pain. However, CT scan and MRCP findings were not consistent with this diagnosis. Celiac sprue was also entertained given nausea, vomiting, and weight loss with abdominal pain but TTG-Ab were negative. ___ ___ syndrome was also considered in etiology for RUQ and pelvic exam was done that showed no cervical motion tenderness; GC and chlamydia were negative. Ultimately it was thought that her right upper quadrant pain was likely secondary to muscle strain in the setting of repeated vomiting; the vomiting was thought to be due to uncontrolled gastoparesis as well as a component of anxiety. Was given Ibuprofen with some resolution of her pain. To continue treatment of her gastroparesis, she was advised to eat smaller meals, avoid fatty foods, and maintain good control of her sugars. She was also given a small supply of Ativan to help reduce anxiety. She was scheduled for outpatient GI follow-up on the same day as discharge, for further management of her gastroparesis. # Type I diabetes mellitus, well-controlled, with complications: Followed at ___.

We did a test called MRCP and found that you had no abnormalities in your bile system. We also did a CT scan and did not find any abnormalities. The most likely cause for your right upper quadrant pain is likely muscle strain from repeated episodes of vomiting, since changes in position seemed to bring this pain on. Your vomiting is likely because of your gastroparesis. To improve gastroparesis, you should try to eat small meals. Large volumes of fluid or food can cause vomiting because of gastroparesis. Other things that you can do include avoiding fats (this can slow your stomach down) and keeping your sugars under control (high sugars also slow your stomach down).

He underwent ___ embolization of right sided colonic angiodysplasia on ___ and then was then found to have ischemic colitis on sigmoidoscopy on ___. He underwent right hemicolectomy on ___. He continued to have melena in the MICU and after transfer to the floor, with multiple workups to localize the bleeding, which did not show definitive results. His GIB gradually slowed down and stopped ___, and his hct remained stable over a course of several days. He no longer required blood transfusions at the time of discharge, and he was no longer producing melanotic stools. He was discharged to a long term acute care facility and will have further followup with GI, surgery, and ENT, Renal. ============== ACTIVE ISSUES ============== # GI Bleed: Patient at rehab with brbpr, dizziness and tachycardia. Upon arrival to the ED H\/H 6.4\/20.7 down from 8.3\/26.9 on the day prior. He received 7 units of pRBCs, 1 unit of FFP and INR was reversed with K centra. GI was consulted and requested a CTA abd\/pelvis, which did not localize the bleed. Flex sig was performed in the MICU and revealed mucosal ulceration consistent with ischemic injury thought secondary to hypotension in the setting of his recent shock. He continued to have extensive bloody\/melanotic stools requiring frequent transfusions and hypotension requiring pressor support. On ___ he went for an ___ guided angiography which showed right sided colonic angiodysplasia which was successfully embolized. He required intermittent blood transfusions over the next few days to keep his HGB >7, GI following. GI performed bedside sigmoidoscopy again on ___ which showed ischemic colitis. On the evening of ___ he began to once again have large-volume melena, was transferred back to MICU for management. He was taken to the OR ___ for R colectomy for ischemic colitis. Was given 5U PRBCs, 3U FFP in OR. Post-op continued to have melanotic bowel movements requiring intermittent transfusions. EGD was performed ___ and was negative, colonoscopy was planned but aborted as Hct then became stable. On ___ the patient was transferred back to the MICU service for persistent GI bleeding, hypotension and ___. Patient was intermittantly hypotensive that was responsive to fluids, but was overall hemodynamically stable. Over his MICU course he he was given a total of 7 units PRBCs as his H\/H were continuosly down trending. H\/H stabilized and patient was subsequently called out to the floor. After transfer to the floor, he underwent colonoscopy on ___, which showed no acute bleeding from the colon and was notable for an adenomatous polyp requiring outpatient followup and polypectomy. He also underwent tagged RBC scans x2 which did not show active bleeding. He started a capsule study which did not show definitive results because the capsule remained in his stomach. Toward the latter part of the week on ___, his GIB had gradually slowed down, and by ___, he had stopped having melenic stools. His hct remained stable at 25.6 on the day of discharge. He will followup with GI after discharge. Given his long course of GI bleeding of unknown source, his warfarin was held during his hospitalization and will continue to be held on discharge to rehab. Both the patient and his family understand the risks of the GI bleeding outweighing the benefits and have agreed to hold warfarin for now. He was started on 81 mg aspirin on ___. # Confusion\/Delirium Patient initially had nighttime delirium in the MICU. Patient was maintained on Seroguel 200mg qHS, tapered down to 100mg over several weeks. Attempted to minimize disturbances and encourage appropriate day\/night cycle. Continued to have altered mental status post-op, in the setting of increasing BUN, possibly due to uremia, although dialysis with a lower BUN did not improve his mental status. Was following commands intermittently, and more consistently after extubation #2. After transfer to the floor, patient required Seroquel infrequently and his confusion had resolved on the day of discharge. # Afib Upon admission, his INR was reversed and his home meds of coumadin, metop, dig and dilt were all held. Rate control agents were restarted with dose adjusted to maintain SBP 100-110 and HR 100-110. Cardiology consulted for aid in management. They concluded rhythm control would not be helpful given prior failed attempts. Will need further discussions to discuss restarting coumadin (currently being held). Post-op he continued to have afib with HR in the 100s, controlled initially on a dilt gtt and digoxin. POD 4 had increasing HR to 130s -> changed to amio gtt from dilt gtt then transitioned to PO amio with adequate rate control prior to discharge. # Nutrition Dobhoff was placed and the patient received tube feeds while PO intake was poor. The tube came out and was not replaced given respiratory distress and the need for face mask ventilation. PICC placed and TPN started and continued until ___. FEES ___ showed still not safe for thin liquids, although may do short trials. Failed speech and swallow again ___. TFs started ___, then restarted again ___. He pulled out his NG tube on ___ and refused NGT replacement. He was evaluated by speech and swallow via fiberoptic swallow study and placed on a honeythickened liquid and pureed solid diet. He tolerated this diet well. # Respiratory distress: Likely due to mucous plugging given inability to cough up secretions, acute onset of episodes of distress, and improvement with deep suctioning. LLL collpse persists in the wake of VAP. Aspiration another likely contributor. s\/p treatment for VAP\/Pseudomonas with cefepime (___). Treated with saline nebs, pulmonary toilet, humidified oxygen, chest ___ for secretions, and guaifenesin as mucolytic. Was exubated ___ -> then failed and reintubated ___ for worsening mental status. Was reextubated ___. After transfer to the floor, his secretions were cleared with suctioning. # Hoarse voice and vocal cord dysfunction: Since extubation, the patient has had hoarse voice. Per ENT, L vocal cord paralysis and mild loss of sensation. While this is likely age-related change combined with ETT injury, they do note that it could be neurologic deficit. If there is persistent recurrent laryngeal nerve injury, he would be a candidate for possible vocal cord medialization as an outpatient. His vocal cord dysfunction is contributing to his respiratory distress, as he has poor cough and ability to protect his airway. High aspiration risk. Voice now stronger, cough still impaired.

He otherwise felt that the patient had been doing well and he didn't know she had come to the hospital. We discussed medication options including Invega vs Risperdal vs Clozaril but she agreed to give Sustenna another chance before considering whether it was helpful or not. She was continued on her home dose of Invega with a plan to transition to long acting injectable only under the care of her psychiatrist. Her Lexapro was switched from day time dosing to evening dosing to faciliate and improve medication compliance. Over the course of hospitalization, patient denied any thoughts of self-harm or suicidal ideation. She continued to have linear and goal oriented thought process. She did not show any obvious signs of psychosis and she maintained all of her ADLs. 2) ETOH ABUSE We also discussed substance use and reported having 2 glasses of wine per week 'socially' despite later stating that she drinks alone at home. Husband gave collateral that was concerning for high quanitity etoh intake. Pt was monitored for withdrawal and showed no signs\/sx of such. Pt was precontemplative regarding sobriety but participated in a SMART recovery meeting while on the psychiatric unit and was interested in continuing this as an outpatient. We recommended she participate in either AA or SMART recovery in a addition to maintaining sobriety. # Goals for discharge and Partial hospital program: Future goals include psychoeducation, medication adherence, psychotherapy, and reducing rehospitalization. These goals will help the patient make a transition back to her home and would allow her to better manage her mood, psychotic, and alcohol craving symtpoms. The goals for partial hospital progam includes psychosocial support, structured environment, access to treaters, psychoeducation, medication compliance, and coping skills. These goals are important because in the absence of this support the patient has worsening psychosis which leads to rehospitalization. # Medical: The patient c\/o of headaches and she refused a CT scan stating that she didn't feel it was medically indicated. She utilized PRN tylenol and ibuprofen that helped alleviate pain. # Social\/Milieu: Patient spent most of the hospitalization on the periphery of the milieu, occasionally interacting and conversing with other patients. Rarely attended groups. # Risk Assessment: While patient has supportive husband and established care providers, patient had a mild decompensation in the community, partially due to poor compliance and substance abuse. Risk was mitigated by administering decanoate antipsychotic, liasing with DMH, PACT team to help at home, ___ services, and the importance of abstinence from alcohol by going to AA and\/or SMART recovery meetings. A repeat decompensation in the community is lower than it has been in her previous admissions since she has been stabilized on decoanate medications. While the patient is likely to deteriorate again, her safety has been good while hospitalized and in the community, and provided she avoids etoh which could lead to disinhibition, she is at low risk for any safety problems in the community. #Prognosis: guarded to fair # Disposition: To home with outpatient follow up.","summary":"You presented after worsening anxiety, increased psychotic thinking, and suicidal ideation.

{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: ASSESSMENT AND PLAN . ___ history of CHF with last EF in ___: 40%, no CAD visible on last cardiac cath in ___, HTN, HLD, current smoker, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation x 2 cardioversion, bad PAD with SFA and B\/L iliac stents, ___ year history of daily opiate use presenting with radiating chest pain, severe htn, atrial fibrillation with LVH and strain pattern. In and out of afib with RVR. Now s\/p cardioversion in NSR on rate and rhythm control with coreg and amiodarone, anticoagulated with pradaxa. . # Chest pain and troponin elevation: Pt described chest pain with radiation to left arm and trop bump to 0.51. Likely NSTEMI but not from CAD. Most likely due to high demand from patient's htn and LVH with afib and rvr causing poor diastolic filling time and wall tension. Pt w\/ risk factors for CAD but ___ cath was clean and EKG changes during hospitalization more suggestive of strain pattern from LVH than ACS. BP was controlled with coreg, lisinopril, and lasix. Pt's initial ___ pressures on admission were in 200s\/100, this decreased to 130s-180s\/80s-90s. Pain resolved with decrease in heart rates and improved BP control and was not present for the past week. In terms of CAD, pt's ___ risk score is >20% for CAD risk equivalent of severe PAD. Pt necessitating aspirin anyway for PAD s\/p stent in ___. At this point, it is unknown what the efficacy is for dabigatran for primary prevention of CAD. Pt should continue with prevention including smoking cessation, lipid lowering and stabalization of plaques with statin therapy, and treatment of hypertension. . # Atrial fibrillation with RVR, SVR, and accelerated junctional rhythm: Pt had atrial fibrillation that was extremely difficult to rate control often sustaining in 140s-160s with pauses lasting up to 5 seconds. When trying to rate control with diltiazem, pt went into accelerated junctional rhythms with retrograde p waves. The patient has been cardioverted twice in past with return of atrial fibrillation. Thus, the patient was started on amiodarone 400 mg BID for prevention of afib recurrence and Pradaxa for anticoagulation. The pt had TEE and underwent successful electrical cardioversion. Notably, the patient reports a transaminitis with previous use of amiodarone; thus, he will need to be closely monitored while on this medication. Pt cannot use Droneardone given his Class II CHF and his CHF exacerbation while in the hospital. Amio isn't an excellent option given pt's baseline lung disease with apical scarring, likely COPD from extensive smoking history, subclinical hypothyroidism history of transaminitis while on the medication, and young age. Pt will need PFTs as pt has not had this before. Cxray and CT scan were performed during this hospitalization; the results of which are as above. Pt remained in NSR after cardioversion. Down the road, if rate\/rhythm control does not ___, it is also possible to perform AVJ ablation with PPM implantation. CHADS score of 2 on dabigatran. After much discussion, dabigatran was chosen as the anticoagulant medication for this patient. He reported being compliant with warfarin in the past, but was annoyed by the fact that he needed such frequent ___ draws. We initially preferred to keep the patient on aspirin with switch to anticoagulant as outpatient when pt showed he was reliable. However, after much discussion with patient and his wife, clear understanding and assurances by patient to adhere to regimen, and pt's request to avoid frequent lab draws, along with risk post cardioversion it was decided that dabigatran would be an acceptable choice for the patient. Also, of note, pt had a very rapid wide complex tachycardia at the time of admission. The most parsimonious explanation would be Afib with aberrancy, but the morphology of the QRS complex was rather atypical for simple aberrant conduction, and there are periods noted on telemetry and ECG where there are wide complex beats which should NOT be aberrantly conducted. It may be that the patient has underlying atrial fibrillation, but has a competing ventricular tachycardia that originates near the left posterior fascicle. An EP study could help differentiate these, but after cardioversion, pt only manifested 3 beat runs of vtach, so no indication for further workup. EP study remains option in future. Such dysrhythmias during the patient's hospitalization made dofetilide a less appealing option. . # Acute on chronic systolic and diastolic CHF: BNP positive. On echo, EF of 40% with severe hypokinesis of the basal half of the inferior and inferolateral walls c\/w prior echo. However, there was worsening of left sided filling pressures. Through hospital stay pt gained 10 pounds with elevation of JVD, increased swelling. This responded well to IV lasix. Pt was placed on lisinopril, Coreg, and lasix. Likely exacerbated by stunned myocardium, htn, rapid ventricular response. Pt was told to restrict fluid intake to diurese back to normal weight. . #SOB: Likely from CHF in combination with baseline lung disease. Pt has extensive smoking history and CXRay revealed flattening of diaphragms suggestive of COPD. Air movement poor but responds well to inhalers. Started spiriva empirically with albuterol prn. CT scan shows apical scarring, I wonder if this could be from his inhaled heroin use. Will need PFTs both for baseline for amiodarone monitoring as well as for characterization of potential obstructive lung disease. . # ___: Creatinine increased from baseline of 0.9 to 1.7 on night s\/p cardioversion. Likely from decreased perfusion. FEurea is<35%. Pt used to be very hypertensive; likely had stunned myocardium post cardioversion, together with some transient relative hypotension during anesthesia causing decreased perfusion in the setting of a kidney that has lost ability to autoregulate ___ to htn. Pt's creatinine trended down and was at 1.1 at discharge. . # Groin pain: Severe but transient for one day. Had workup with ultrasound, hip x ray which was unrevealing. . # Dyslipidemia\/Diabetes screen: HgbA1c=6% indicates prediabetes and lipids with LDL 117, HDL 26; Has CAD risk equivalent of PAD. Outpatient physician can start nicotinic acid for HDL. Notably has strong history of myopathies with statins. LDL should be at 100 given CAD risk equivalent of PAD disease. If statin to be added would try pravastatin as pt has had difficulty with more potent statins. . # HTN: On lisinopril, carvedilol. Still hypertensive to 180s at times. Can uptitrate lisinopril as outpatient. Can also increase coreg to 50mg, as patient tolerated this well while in hospital. Secondary causes investigated in ___ included angiography of the renal arteries which demonstrated no evidence of any flow limiting lesions, negative plasma fractionated metanephrines (very high NPV), elevated urine normetanephrines, no evidence of coarctation, normal serum aldosterone and renin while pt was on Ace-inhibitors. On this admission, htn assumed to be most likely from essential htn. Ddx includes 1) renal artery stenosis--No renal bruits and tolerated ACE inhibitors including high dose captopril very well; 2) pheochromocytoma--evaluated with plamsa and urine fractionated metanephrines (plamsa normetanephrines mildly elevated but very difficult to interpret in setting of opiate withdrawal, afib, stress etc.), 3) adrenal hyperplasia, 4) hyperaldosteronism (Conn's)-- no evidence of electrolyte abnormalities, and 5) aortic coarctation-- not seen on CXRay and no pulse dissociation between upper and lower extremities. PCP can follow up with urine metanephrines at ___. These are likely nondiagnostic given in hospital setting and variety of adrenergic inducing issues ongoing. Would repeat after one months time at PCP's discretion if secondary cause is suspected. To my knowledge, pt's adrenals have never been visualized either. . # Withdrawal: Started on methadone and given diazepam. Last dose of methadone ___ was 10mg. Weaning down diazepam to prn. Will be seen in ___ clinic today. For smoking, given nicotine patches. Discharged with 6 tablets of diazepam for prn use. . # Low Urine pH: Unclear cause: drug vs infection, vs RTA? Pt's bicarbonate is good. Negative for infection. . # Fluctuations in Hgb: Unclear cause; most likely ___ to fluid shifts from hypertension, afib, heart failure, and swings in volume status . # Subclinical hypothyroidism: Elevated TSH, normal free T4. Not treated. Should continue to monitor. . # PVD: Pt with SFA and B\/L iliac stents in ___. Stent intervention has greatly improved his symptoms. Will keep pt on aspirin. Will continue with secondary prevention including smoking cessation, lipid lowering and stabalization of plaques with statin therapy, and treatment of hypertension. . # Pneumonia: On initial admission, there was subjective fevers over 3 days with increased cough in setting of radiographic evidence of possible pneumonia. Pt treated with course of levofloxacin . #CODE: Full #CONTACT: Patient, wife ___ ___ . Transitional: Needs to continuing taking dabigatran. Amiodarone loading now for 10g then 200 mg daily. Need to monitor for amio toxicity given previous hx of transaminitis while on drug, baseline lung disease, subclinical hypothyroidism. Needs baseline PFTs. HTN control can be more aggressive. HDL low, can try nicotinic acid, can try pravastatin or less myopathic statin for goal LDL<100. If pt goes back into afib and cannot be controlled, then consider AVJ ablation with permanent pacer.","summary":"You were admitted for chest pain and were found to be in atrial fibrillation with a very fast heart rate as well as having a very high ___ pressure. Attempts at rate control were ineffective and you had pauses of up to 5 seconds. After much discussion, it was decided to electrically cardiovert you back into sinus rhythm with prevention of future atrial fibrillation with amiodarone. It is imperative that you take your dabigatran (pradaxa) twice a day without fail. This will lower your risk of having a stroke from your paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. You previously suffered liver injury while on amiodarone. You will need to be very closely monitored while on this medication.

She looked euvolemic on physical exam, but her I\/O balance has been very negative secondarily to poor PO, no IVF and high UOP. She had severe back after her back surgery. Initially it was not clear how much it was dehydration, poor PO intake only taking free water and HCTZ in the post-op setting vs. SIADH, most likely secondarily to pain. Nephrology was consulted who recommended 3% saline. Initially we tried free water restriction and follow up Na, but pt did now improve within ___ hours. PICC was placed and 3% NaCl was started.

The dyspnea was thought to be secondary a combination of the effusion and the restrictive effect of the abdominal ascites. O2 remained stable on room air throughout the hospitalization. Given the patient's renal function (discussed below), the team was concerned about the effects of paracentesis on the patients kidneys. Once the patient's creatinine was stabilized and trending towards baseline, a therepeutic paracentesis was done, removing 3L.

Per orthopedic surgery, it is normal for patients to lose blood after surgeries, and she was having no other source of blood loss, so this is the likely cause of her acute drop. Patient was not started back on home plavix during hospitalization in the setting of recent bleed. #HTN and tachycardia: Patient initially told the team she was not taking any medications at home. After further investiation, we found that prescriptions were being refilled in her name. On further discussion, it became clear that she was taking these medications, although she had been reluctant to share this information given that she did not have a PCP managing these medications. Home meds were atenolol, hydrochlorothiazide and lisinopril. She appears to have developed rebound tachycardia and hypertension in the setting of these medications being held perioperatively. Prior to learning that she was taking these medications, we started her on amlodipine. Blood pressures only mildly improved over a 1.5 day period on amlodipine, not enough time to see a full effect. Heart rates peaked in 110s-120s, and SBPs 150s-180s. We sent patient for a V\/Q scan to rule out pulmonary embolism in the setting of recent surgery, tachycardia, and t wave inversions in III and flatening in V3 in an EKG showing sinus tachycardia.

She underwent CT\/ MRI\/A for which showed an acute hemorrhage in left basal ganglia region, and evidence of possible old bleed in right occipital region. Blood pressure was in the range of 120- 140 systolic. Though the location of bleed is more typical for hypertensive hemorrhage, her blood pressure was not sufficiently elevated. The more likely mechanism therefore, was thought to be amyloid angiopathy, also supported by diagnosis of dementia and previous bleed. Aspirin was held due to ICH. She was started on heparin SC for prevention of DVT after 72 hours. HCTZ was increased to 25 mg\/day to achieve even tighter control of blood pressure. She was seen by ___ therapy who suggested acute rehab for placement. Diet was modified and advanced per swallow evaluation recs. This should be followed up closely with frequent evaluations to assess swallowing function and diet should be advanced\/ monitored per recs.

The patient was loaded with phenytoin on ___, and had decreased episodes of paroxysmal poor responsiveness. However, he became more encephalopathic, and phenytoin was discontinued on ___. He continued on keppra and lacosamide without further clinical seizures between ___ - ___. Patient pulled off his EEG leads but clinically improved therefore was kept of EEG monitoring. #Encephalopathy: By ___, he became more encephalopathic and agitated. He had been conversant and appropriate on ___. CT ___ was obtained which was stable. Evaluation for infectious etiology was negative with blood and urine cultures. Patient had a mild leukocytosis on ___ that downtrended thereafter and was not febrile. His mental status change was attributed to multiple AEDs, mild benzodiazepine withdrawal (patient refusing home PO doses), and hospital acquired delirium. Given urgency of radiation planning, patient was given 5mg zyprexa IM BID to help him stay calm during procedures. Home Ativan was converted to IV Ativan (1.5mg q6hours) to avoid benzodiazepine withdrawal, as patient otherwise often refused PO medications. His mental status improved throughout the admission and was able to tolerate PO medications. #Tachycardia: On the day of discharge patient was working with occupational therapy he became tachycardic to 139 with standing and walking.

Had a history of C. diff in ___, which was treated with PO flagyl. During this hospitalization, C. diff was positive again, and he was started on 125 mg PO vancomycin. He did not have fevers or leukocytosis at this time or during the hospitalization, but did have a markedly low albumin of 1.6. Stool cultures for salmonella, shigella, campylobacter as well as stool ova and parasites unrevealing. After 6 days on vancomycin, patient's symptoms had not improved. Vancomycin was increased to 500 mg PO to treat severe C. diff. GI performed a colonoscopy, which did not demonstrate evidence of colitis. Biopsies were taken at this time and revealed normal colonic mucosa. At the time of discharge, patient was still having frequent soft\/watery diarrhea despite some improvement on the PO Vancomycin. Etiology of diarrhea remains uncertain, as patient's course is atypical for C. diff infection, and current treatment does not appear to be resolving diarrhea. GI recommends MRE vs. CTE in the outpatient setting to further determine etiology. #Recurrent C. Difficile infection (see history above) Switched from PO Metronidazole to Vancomycin Oral Liquid ___ mg PO\/NG QID for 14 day course given this is first line treatment for recurrent C. diff infection. Initially improved though then continued having loose stools. Vancomycin was increased to 500 mg to treat severe C. diff on ___ for a complete 14 day course of the higher dosage. Other etiologies will be worked up as an outpatient, including potential resistant C.diff. #Cervical stenosis Patient underwent C4-C6 laminectomies on ___. Patient tolerated the procedure well. Please see the operative note for details. The patient had short episodes of hypertension intra-operatively and had an estimated blood loss of 200mL, therefore a hemovac drain was left in place. He was placed in a soft collar. He was extubated in the OR and transferred to the PACU for recovery. He required a brief administration of phenylephrine for hypotension in the PACU, though responded appropriately and promptly. He was then transferred to the neuro step-down unit for continued blood pressure monitoring. The patient's neurologic status was monitored throughout his hospitalization. On POD#1, his lower extremity weakness was slightly improved. His pain was well managed with IV+PO and then only PO pain regimen.

His EKG had no signs of ST elevations, but there were areas in the inferior-lateral leads that were concerning for possible ischemia. He had a stool guaiac in the ED and was started on a heparin gtt. He was transferred to the floor where he had no complaints of chest pain. He was continued on a heparin gtt. He was started on aspirin and loaded with plavix 600mg. His SBP remained low during his hospital stay. We discontinued his home dose of atenolol and switched him to metoprolol tid. However, the patient started to develop intermittent bradycardia (see below) and we had to decrease the dosing of metoprolol to 25mg bid. We did not start him on a ACE inhibitor, given that his systolic blood pressures were in the low 100s. He remained hemodynamically stable until his cardiac catheterization on ___.

Seizures were controlled with 4 AEDs and an empriric course of systemic steroids provided improvement in the patient's mental status. Over the past month or so the patient has begun to have frequent periods of nodding off and urinary incontinence. There was concern for either medication toxicity or intermittent seizures and she was admitted for repeat imaging of the brain, continuous video EEG monitoring and possible titration of her AEDs. She was found to have a UTI and is completed a course of antibiotics. Her symptoms of incontinence have resolved and her sleepiness is improving. # CHRONIC UNCAL HERNIATION \/ PACHYMENINGITIS: Appears worse on repeat MRI compared with prior. On exam she continues to be alert. She does have some cognitive deficits (can only name 5 words that start with the letter \"s\" in 1 min). The etiology of her uncal herniation could be either secondary to increased intracranial pressure or low CSF pressure in the spine from an occult CSF leak. Fundoscopic exam did not reveal papilledema. The pain service was consulted with a question of empiric blood patch but ultimately the procedure was deemed to risky because an accidental puncture of the dura could be fatal in the setting of increased intracranial pressure.

This, combined with recent poor PO intake, likely contributed to her symptoms. Additionally, pt has limited Cr clearance, likely impairing secretion of insulin and subsequently increasing basal rates. It is also possible that pt is not giving herself the accurate amount of insulin since she has poor eye-sight. ___ followed pt during admission. Pt was given NPH 45U in the AM and will continue this regimen at home. (Her home prior regimen was NPH 60U in AM and 20 U in ___ . #. Proximal muscle weakness: Pt reports proximal muscle weakness, however, she is ___ throughout on neuro exam. CK, TSH, LFTs, cortisol syntropin test all wnl. ESR 28 but normal CRP. Pt denies jaw claudication or temporal headaches. Muscle weakness likely ___ hypoglycemia. Pt's insulin regimen was adjusted inhouse. . # Fall: Pt fell on ambulation from the bathroom to her bed. Fall was secondary to poor eye site. Pt fell on her buttocks. Pt had no head trauma, no LOC. She did have some tenderness along ligaments and muscles of spine. Pt told that this was likely musculoskelet and not a fracture, and she was offered an X-ray but pt declined. Pt had full range of motion. Pt was given oxycodone and baclofen for pain and discomfort. . #. UA positive for trace leuks: urine culture negative. . #. HTN: Initialy held lasix and diovan in setting of orthostasis. Both medicatiosn were reintroduced at lower dosages. She was given lasix 80mg every other day and diovan 80mg daily. . #. Hypercholesterolemia: Continued statin and zetia . #. Glaucoma: Continued eye drops . #. Vitamin D\/B12 deficiency: Continue B12\/D PENDING LABS: -ACTH from ___ and ___ TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: -Full code -reccomend pt continue to get workup for her symptoms of hypoglycemia, weakness. ACTH results still pending. Pt might benefit from repeat co-syntropin test and from checking aldosterone. She had adequate response to co-syntropin, however morning cortisol was low at 3. -Hypoglycemia: reccomend pt ultimately be switched to glargine for long acting control. Pt declined during this hospitalization. Also reccomended that she start using the insulin pen given her poor vision. Pt will follow up with endocrinologist.","summary":"You were admitted to the hospital for dizzy episodes, weakness, low sugars. You were given fluids. You had a cortisol test to see if you have \"adrenal insuficiency.\" The results came back negative, however there is 1 result still pending (ACTH level). It is very unlikely that you have adrenal insuficiency but it is still important to wait on this final result. It is possible that your orthpstatic hypotension symptoms are from \"autonomic neuropathy\" which is from diabetes."}
{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: Please see previous discharge summary for details. In summary, Mr. ___ returned for another recurrent episode of aphasia\/dysarthria. An MRI showed a left thalamic infarct which was new in the interim since prior admission, in addition to the known left splenium infarct. This was also not felt to be explaining his symptoms and felt to be an indication of ongoing thrombogenic physiology. Etiology of these recurrent TIAs\/strokes remained unknown. Coumadin was stopped as it was felt to not be of additional utility. Platelet function and clopidogrel test was sent and suggested some degree of clopidogrel resistance. Per agreement with Vascular surgery and Vascular medicine, decision was made to stop the clopidogrel and start a trial of ticagrelor instead. A repeat swallow evaluation was also performed to exclude risk of aspiration in setting of pharyngeal\/laryngeal fibrosis from previous radiation therapy. TEE was attempted at the recommendation of Vascular medicine, however it was unsuccessful due to inability to pass probe through his oropharynx due to fibrosis- no further attempts were made. He was fitted with a Zio patch cardiac monitor in attempt to capture any occult arrhythmia as a source of cardioemboli. Aside from stopping Coumadin and clopidogrel, and starting ticagrelor, no other medication changes were made. His neurologic examination at discharge was at baseline. Transitional issues: [ ] Please continue aspirin and ticagrelor indefinitely for carotid artery stent and secondary stroke prevention. [ ] Please follow up results of Zio patch cardiac monitoring; if any cardiac arrhythmia found we strongly suggest starting systemic anticoagulation (please consult with Stroke provider if this is found). [ ] Stroke, Neurosurgery and Vascular Surgery followup arranged. [ ] Patient's home antihypertensives were all resumed with exception of metoprolol which was halved to 6.25mg BID. Please continue to monitor and titrate for a long term goal of normotension. [ ] Continue atorvastatin for lipid-lowering therapy and obtain repeat LDL in ___ months. Monitor LFTs.","summary":"You were readmitted for another repeat episode of difficulty with speech and slurring. Since your blood pressure was found to be high in the setting of one of these episodes, we do not feel strongly that hypotension is the main precipitant of your symptoms. Instead, we performed a blood test that suggested that Plavix was not as effective as a medication for you as it should be. Therefore, we stopped that and started another similar medication called ticagrelor (brand name ___ which you should take twice a day (morning and evening), in addition to the aspirin 81mg daily.

{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: ___ year old woman with a history of chronic dCHF, pAfib on coumadin, CKD III, HTN, and pulmonary HTN presents with several days of progressive CHF symptoms with acute worsening ___ PTA. Found to be in Afib\/RVR and acute dCHF. Was given a couple doses of IV lasix with rapid improvement, then kept on 40mg PO lasix (on 20mg at home) with stable creat, O2 sats, BP. Thought is that she has worsening of her chronic dCHF due to Afib rhythm and poor HR control. Initally rates were 100-110s, so her metprolol was titrated up from 50mg BID to ___ QID (home on 200mg bid). Rates still 90-100s, so digoxin added per cardiology consult. Rates now ___ with dig on board and given her CKD, she will be discharged on digoxin 0.125mg QOD. Appears from her chart that she was admitted with similar symptoms in ___ (dCHF in setting of afib) and spontaneously had converted and had been mostly sinus in her outpt follow up visits. Has been on amio as outpt per Dr. ___. Given she is on amio, checked TSH to see if this was contributing to her conversion to Afib, and she was in fact, found to be hyperthyroid. Her synthroid dose was reduced. It was felt in past that she does better in sinus, but cardiology aggreed that we unlikley would be able to acheive successful cardioversion while she is in hyperthyroid state and we should instead focus on rate control. One concern is that once she flips to NSR, dose of BB is quite high so she was warned about sudden LH or weakness (check pulse). Her INR were borderline so her coumadin dose was slightly increased (2mg 5days a week, 4mg TTh). Her Avapro dose was reduced 300 to 150 to allow titration of metoprolol. She did overall very well here with improvement in her resp status. Her chest pain on admission was likely due to acute pulm edema and resolved after diuresis and she was ruled out.

{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: ___ with no known cardiac history who had witnessed cardiac arrest, s\/p resuscitation, with concern for LAD lesion, now transferred from ___ ICU to ___ CCU for cardiac catheterization. 1. S\/p cardiac arrest: It was unclear how long pt was down before compressions started but he was in ventricular fibrillation and after being shocked, he returned to sinus tach within ten minutes. Pt was not cooled because he was responsive and moving around by the time he reached ___. Also, cooling protocol had not been initiated at OSH and by time he reached BI he was out of the window to start cooling. On arrival he was tubed and sedated. Pt was loaded with amio. Over the next ___ hours, weaned off vent and pt responded appropriately. He did not have any other dangerous arrhythmias. Etiology of vfib was most likely secondary to ischemia. EKG and Echo were concerned of mid-LAD lesion. Initially cardiac cath was performed and showed that there appeared to have been a probable LAD territory infarct\/thrombus that spontaneously resolved with medical therapy. EP was consulted and performed EP study, placed single chambe ICD with no complications. A CMR was performed and preliminarily suggested some scaring but final read is still pending at time of discharge. It was rec f\/u with Dr. ___ ___ from cognitive neurology at time of d\/c. He will need repeat echo ___ wks after d\/c. . Cardiomyopathy: Pt was previously healthy and now with depressed LV function with apical hypokinesis. Most likely secondary to ischemia, but concern given coronary arteriogram did not show any direct evidence occlusion. Echo pattern was somewhat consistent with takatsubo's. Pt was started on metoprolol, lisinopril and coumadin (apical akinesis) at time of discharge. He was euvolemic without need for diuresis, so was not started on lasix on discharge. . STE in lateral leads: Post cath, pt had persistent STE in lateral leads and he was asymptomatic. CE were relatively flat with exception of CK (but pt had rhabdo). Concern for coronary vasospasm, so started on diltiazem drip, but this did not resolve to elevations. Pt was re-cathed, but coronaries were clean. Concern that these elevations are secondary to myocarditis. Labs were notable for mildly positive rheumatoid factor, negative varicella and EBV. At time of d\/c ___, viral cx and antimyocardial ab were all pending. Pt was discharged on home dose of asa and started on plavix 75. . H. flu PNA: RML consilidation found post extubation. Sputum cx grew out h. flu and pt has not had prior vaccination. He was treated with azithromycin and ctx. At time of d\/c he had two additional days of ctx so was started on cefpodoxime to finish the abx course. . # Rhabdomyolysis: Thought to be secondary to amiodarone and Atorvastatin. Pt's CKs rose to >11K but kidney function remained normal throughout. He also had mild transaminitis. With aggressive fluid resuscitation, CK's trended down and were wnl by time of d\/c. Kidney fxn remained wnl as well. Pt should avoid atorvastatin and other lipophilic statins in the future. . # Delirium: After pt was extubated, he was persistently delerius with difficulty following commands, signs of anterograde amnesia, and difficulty with word finding. He was also anxious and paranoid, particularly at night. Over course of hospitalization his MS improved but was still mildly impaired at time of d\/c.

{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: In summary, Mr. ___ is a ___ y\/o M with newly diagnosed AML s\/p \"7+3\" regimen with AraC and Idarubicin now transitioning to supportive care. . # AML \/ BLAST CRISIS: WBC count of 96.9 on admission was concerning for new presentation of acute leukemia. Bone marrow biopsy on admission confirmed the diagnosis of AML with greater than 50% blasts. Emergent leukophoresis was considered but deferred. He was treated with \"7+3\" regimen with cytarabine and idarubicin, which he tolerated moderately. Tumor lysis labs were monitored and he was treated symptomatically. To help his blood counts return to normal, G-CSF was started on a daily basis. . 30 days after the start of induction chemotherapy, a repeat bone marrow biopsy was done. The full results are provided above; findings were most consistent with relapsing leukemia. Peripheral smears in the days that followed showed increasing numbers of blast cells. At time of discharge it is clear that his disease is relapsing. However, after discussion with both Mr. ___, his wife and his daughter, the decision has been made to hold off on more chemotherapy. The risks of more treatment, including prolonged neutropenia, fevers, infection, and longer hospitalization, outweigh the benefits to be had in terms of survival. There have been several family meetings and the course we have agreed upon is for supportive care with transfusions and antibiotics. . # PANCYTOPENIA: He had thromboctopenia with PLT 21 and anemia with HCT 25 on admission. After chemotherapy, he continued to have low counts and was transfused on an almost daily basis with pRBC and PLTs. Etiology of instability was explored (antibody workup, hemolysis workup); however, no clear source was identified. On ___, he developed a fever and SOB while receiving blood and triggered for a transfusion reaction. He now always receives tylenol with his transfusions. However, the workup was negative and it was thought at the time that his underlying fevers (drug vs infxn) and fluid-overloaded status provided a better explanation for his symptoms. . # FEVERS: He developed fevers up to 104. Given his post-chemotherapy neutropenia, he was worked up for infectious causes and covered with broad-spectrum antimicrobials. Lung studies (CXR\/CT) showed findings consistent with pneumonia; however, he did not have significant cough and all of his blood cultures were negative. A urine culture grew VRE and he received a ten-day course of daptomycin. Abdominal CT showed colonic fat stranding and wall thickening indicative of diverticulitis. He was treated with meropenem and this transitioned to a PO regimen of ciprofloxacin and metronidazole. At time of discharge, he has been afebrile for over one week and his diarrhea has resolved. He will continue on PO cipro\/Flagyl in the setting of prolonged neutropenia. . # CHEST PAIN \/ DYSPNEA ON EXERTION: He presented with DOE and he had been complaining of SOB\/chest pain intermittently during his stay in the hospital. His cardiac enzymes remained flat on each occasion and the chest pain resolved on its own. GI causes were also considered, especially since he has been c\/o difficulty swallowing; however, speech and swallow studies did not reveal a clear source of dysphagia\/odynophagia. He was treated with pantoprazole and chest pain resolved. . # VOLUME STATUS: Because of his anemia and thrombocytopenia, he had to be transfused with pRBC and platelets on a daily basis which resulted in severe fluid overload (2+ leg edema, scrotal edema, pulmonary effusions, mild pulmonary edema). He was placed on O2 and nebulizer as needed and aggressive diuresis was started with furosemide 40mg IV TID. Repeat TTE showed no worsening in heart function after chemotherapy with anthracycline. Gradually as his transfusions became less frequent the standing Lasix was stopped. He now gets 20 mg IV lasix when he needs transfusions. At time of discharge he continued to have 2+ pitting edema and he is satting in the mid to high 90's on room air. . # DIARRHEA: He developed severe diarrhea in the setting of neutropenia. C diff was negative multiple times and stool studies were non-revealing. As above, CT abdomen showed colonic wall changes consistent with diverticulitis, and his diarrhea resolved after treatment with meropenem transitioned to levo and Flagyl which he will continue for one week after discharge. . # RENAL FAILURE: Baseline creatinine was unknown at admission. Increased NSAID usage was likely contributing, but also there was likely a prerenal component and possibly some degree of uric acid nephropathy given uric acid of 14.9 on admission. He was treated with continuous IVF with sodium bicarbonate, allopurinol and hydroxyurea. His kidney function normalized and these medications were discontinued prior to discharge.","summary":"You were hospitalized for treatment of acute leukemia. You received chemotherapy but the cancer could not be fully cured. Since you received chemotherapy your blood counts have been low and you have required multiple blood transfusions and will likely continue to require these transfusions. You were also diagnosed with diverticulitis (inflammation of your colon) and are being treated with antibiotics for this. We have added medications to your regimen. These include antibiotics to help treat and prevent infection. To treat the diverticulitis, you will need to take 500 mg of ciprofloxacin twice daily for 7 days and 500 mg of flagyl three times daily for 7 days. You should not consume alcohol while you are on flagyl as this can cause an adverse reaction. You will also need to permenantly take 12.5 mg of metoprolol twice daily."}

The differential considerations include calcified aneurysm versus mesenteric mass. This lesion is not amenable for biopsy. On the CTA Abd\/pelvis, this was again visualized at the branch of the SMA in the mid-abdomen. Per radiology, this was likely due to a thrombosed aneurysm and chronic. Carcinoid is less favored given the absence of small bowel abnormality and jejunal location.

Highest concern was for recurrence of malignancy. The patient underwent a dx and therapeutic thoracentesis of 1600ccs. The fluid was sent for cell count, culture and cytology. The fluid was consistent with an exudate but did not seem infectious in nature (875 WBCs, 81% lymphs, 6% atypical cells; pH 7.44, LDH 107, total protein 4.3, glucose 91). Cytology is pending at this time. Prior to thoracentesis, the patient's oxygen saturation was in the low ___ on room air. After the procedure, she was satting in the mid ___ on RA with ambulation. Her post-procedure chest x-ray did demonstrate persistance of a mild to moderate effusion and the patient was counselled that her symptoms may very well recurr. In addition to the above studies, a nasopharyngeal swab was sent for viral culture and retuned negative. She was asked to seek medical attention should her symptoms recurr and follow up with her PCP ___ 2 weeks for cytology results and consideration of further chest imaging depending on cytology results. # Hyponatremia. This resolved quickly with the administration of 2L NS and may have been provoked by free water intake in a predisposed host who has had intermittent hyponatremia in the past. She was instructed to drink to thirst in the future and not to exceed ___ L of volume intake. Her exam and labs (slightly altered upon arrival, tongue trauma, elevated CK) suggested that she had symptomatic hyponatremia complicated by a seizure. Neurology was consulted and recommended MRI\/A of the patient's brain which was done and was negative for mass or vascular abnormality. After reviewing, the MRI\/A, the neurologists agreed that she likely seized due to acute hyponatremia and recommended against anti-epileptic medications but, rather, just recommended control of sodium levels. In addition, given her elevated CK, she was instructed to hold her statin until further discussion with her PCP. # Back pain. CT from ___ reported several compression deformities. Given above c\/f malignancy, this was relayed to the patient to be followed up on by her PCP. While in house, her motor, sensory and reflex exams were normal and she was treated symptomatically with a lidopatch, valium, oxycodone and tylenol. # Initial report of hematemesis and hemoptysis were further clarified. It seems the patient was coughing up blood tinged sputum and did not, in fact, experience hematemesis. This was clarified after the patient's sodium returned to normal and her mental status cleared. The patient remained full code throughout her hospitalization.","summary":"You were admitted to the hospital for shortness of breath with a low oxygen level and a low sodium level. You were found to have fluid in the space between your lung and your diaphragm. This fluid was drained using a procedure called a thoracentesis. The reason for the fluid accumulation is not clear and there are labs tests pending to help us determine the cause of the fluid accumulation. It is quite possible that this will happen again so you must seek medical attention if you become more short of breath or have any other new symptoms. Your sodium level may have dropped because of large volumes of water ingestion. Your sodium level increased to normal with IV infusion of salt water and remained normal for the rest of your hospital course. You should only drink between 1 and 1.5 liters of fluid per day. Because of concern for a seizure, you were seen by a neurology team. They recommended a MRI\/A of your brain which they reviewed.

Patient was admitted to the intensive care unit and placed in cervical traction. After reducing adequately, she was taken to the Operating room on ___ and underwent a ___ Corpectomies and C4-T1 Fusion. This was without complication. She was extubated, removed from traction and transferred back to the ICU. Post operative CT revealed good fusion. A SOMI brace was ordered and she was liberalized to HOB at 45 degrees. The patient was febrile to 102.6 on ___ with a leukocytosis of 17.7. Blood and urine cultures were sent. CXR did not show a definite infiltrate however the patient did have a productive cough. In the setting of elevated WBC, fever and cough she was started on Levofloxacin for PNA. Sputum culture was requested. Lower extremity dopplers were negative for DVT. A speech and swallow eval was ordered given patient's swallowing difficulties and was performed on ___. Unfortunately the patient failed the study and so she was placed on strict NPO diet. On ___ she was taken back to the OR and underwent a C3-T3 fusion. During positioning she was noted to have a sacral decubitis so a wound care consult was called. INR was 1.5 and HCT was 22 so she was transfused with PRBC's and FFP. Post operatively she was not extubated due to laryngeal edema (difficult intubation) therefore ENT was consulted for evaluation. They recommended steroids, PPI and to keep her intubated. She was continued on vanc\/gent for prophylaxsis. On ___ her exam was grossly stable but difficult to examine due to being intubated. CT C-spine revealed moderate retropharyngeal edema but no hardware malfunction or misalignment. On ___ she remained stable, extubation was discussed but she was not doing well on CPAP trial and also did not have a cuff leak. On ___, patient self extubated. She was breathing well on face mask. Strength was full post operatively and her pain was being treated with morphine. On ___, the decadron was being weaned due to delirium and she required the addition of olanzapine. She was febrile to 101 on ___ and she was pancultured. On this day she was reintubated for hypoxia. She required high sedation to prevent self extubation. On ___ the patient was being prepped for the OR with ENT but was noticed in the afternoon to be unresponsive with eyes deviated laterally and out, with flickering of the eye lids. She was given dilantin and ativan and a stat Head CT was performed which was questionable for a right temporal hypodensity. Per neurorad recommendation an MRI was performed. This was negative for stroke or lesion therefore an EEG was ordered to rule out seizure activity. EEG was negative therefore it was discontinued along with the dilatin. On ___ the patient was very lethargic so her sedation was held (> 1 hr) for examination. During this time she self-extubated. O2 sats were stable but she was noted to be aspirating therefore she was reintubated and subsequently trached. On ___ she was neurologically stable and vent was weaned to a trach collar. Her staples were d\/c'd. On ___ patient was transferred to the floor. However, she spiked another low grade temp of 100.8 and was recultured and had an additional chest x-ray. Fever work-up was negative, except for positive pan-sensitive pseudomonas on sputum culture. On ___ Infectious disease consult was called due to patient's leukocytosis and continued fevers. They recommended switching her antibiotics to Cefepime, obtaining a mini-bal, a clostridium difficile culture, and possible ___ guided LP. These studies were found to be negative. On ___ Her INR was found to be trending upwards. Hematology was consulted for their input and recommended Vit. K+. Her PEG was delayed because on her fever and wbc. Nutrition recommendations for TPN was initiated. ENT was also re-contacted for possibility of scoping this pt for eval of possible para-vocal mass that was initially seen on intubation for ACDF. Due to concern surrounding her waxing\/wanning mental status On ___ Her INR returned to normal, her TPN was initiated as per nutrition. ENT did a fiberoptic evaluation and they found poor management of secretions, but no mass and they signed off. She had her LP in INR on this day. Neuromedicine saw her and fel;t that she was in a oculogyrate crisis. Benadryl was given without good effect. She was transfered to medicine due to the complexity of her problems. Her medical floor course can be summarized as follows: ====================================================== INACTIVE TISSUES: ================= #. FEVERS\/LEUKOCYTOSIS: She was inherited on vanco\/cefepime broad spectrum antibiotics without clear source of infection- a pan sensitive psuedomonas was found in the sputum but no radiographic evidence of pneumonia was ever apparent. On ___, her antibiotics were discontinued due to the lack of fevers and a downtrending WBC. A small fluid collection seen on CT along the posterior cervical surgical incision site was sampled via ___, with a bland fluid not suggestive of infection. Urine, blood cultures were negative, as were C dif. On ___, she spiked to 102, she was then restarted on vanco and cefepime. She had pan culture which at the time was all negative. Her only + culture was from sputum the day before with pan-sensitive pseudomonas, although there was no radiologic evidence of infection (pneumonia) this was thought to be causing elevation in WBC- so she was treated with cefepime for a total of 10 days last day was on ___ and she has been afebrile since then. #. DELIRIUM\/ENCEPHALOPATHY: she showed a waxing and waning level of responsiveness. EEG had previously shown only diffuse slowing of encephalopathy, which could have been from her surgical interventions, steroids, zyprexa, infection. There was concern for seizure activity due to contraction of the arms and eye deviation, so an extended EEG was conducted without definite evidence of seizures. Deliriogenic meds avoided. She was then treated for seizures with Keppra and then Dilantin was added since she continue to have seizure activity. Within hours of her dilantin infusion, she developed a severe rash. So this was stopped and she was continued on keppra and started on Lacosamide. She was doing well and then had her last episode of confusion last week in the setting of receiving trazadone for sleep and pain meds. Her sedating meds were held and pt has been doing much better. Now A+O x 3. She was restarted on oxycodone for pain and I would consider restarting Ambien once pt is stable on her new location. There were multiple head images which did not show anatomical cause of her confusion or seizures #. OCULOGYRIC CRISIS: she had a dystonic reaction from zyprexa with an unclosable mouth and eye deviation. This lysed with IV benadryl on ___. She had similar symptoms on ___ which again responded to IV benadryl. Anti-psychotics were avoided. ACTIVE ISSUES: =============== # Seizures: Has been having unusual EEG activity and three confirmed seizures since ___, most recently on ___. She was loaded on Keppra on ___. Loaded with dilantin on ___ but experienced a drug rash. She then had recurrence of witnessed sz over the weekend on ___ that lasted 3 min with lip smacking, arm movement and blinking. No other event since then. Spoke to neurology who recommended increasing dose of Lacosamide from 200-> 300 mg on ___. We still uncertain what is causing the sz activity, multiple head images did not show anatomical causes. Possible encephalalitis r\/t medications. However, pt has remained stable. Neuro is okay with us restarting pt on neurontin for neuropathic pain, so this was done on ___ and dose was increased to BID. - Continue ___ Keppra 1500mg BID and Lacosamide 300mg BID - Started on neurontin 300mg ___ on ___ for neuropathic pain which can increase to BID today if tolerating well and may increase to TID - Neurology will be calling your facility to schedule a follow-up appointment within 2 weeks. # s\/p Tracheostomy: Patient was complaining of sore throat and discomfort. No change in oxygen saturations. Dr. ___, ___ surgeon, did not feel she was amenable to a trach revision to a smaller trach. Recommended ENT evaluation for increased secretions, failed speech and swallow, apparent difficulty with the trach. ENT saw pt on ___t bedside and findings are consistent with weakened muscles and aspiration, so no intervention at this time, except for cont with trach care, humidified oxygen and speech therapy. She also had video swallow on ___ that showed aspiration. So for now pt should cont to be NPO. - Continue supplemental oxygen via trach mask - Trach care - Cont to work with speech therapy - Pt able to clear secreations and to use passmier valve . # s\/p cervical fusion\/Anterolisthesis: she was taken to the operating room on ___ and underwent a ___ Corpectomies and C4-T1 Fusion. This was without complication, but as noted above she had multiple complications. Anterolisthesis (anterior dislocation of her spinous process) was found to have worsened on the most recent MRI c-spine. SOMI cervical brace was placed per Neurosurgery and should be on at all times. The brace was just adjusted yesterday and is fitting more comfortable by patient. She has small pressure ulcer on her chin that is healing and on the back of her head that is also healing. Neurosurgery will be following the patient and she has appointment on ___. She will have a repeat CT scan at that time. - Per neurosurgery: Patient must be lying flat if she is in an aspen collar, otherwise she must be put in a full neck brace at all times (would prefer not changing from SOMI brace to Collar since concern for dislocation). # Pain: pt with pain at her surgical site and due to position related to brace. She has also chronic neuropathic pain and has been on neurontin and multiple meds prior to her admission. She asked to have neurotin restarted. Neuro was okay in adding this medication. - Cont on tylenol ___ Q 6 hours as needed - Restarted on oxycodone 5mg Q 6 hours as needed - Restarted on neurotin 300mg once ___, will increase to BID tomorrow if tolerates and to TID on the following day . # CP\/SOB: Patient had previously reported having new, sudden onset chest pain that was sharp and substernal ___. Normal EKG, CXR and Trop. CKMB was initially 18.8 and has been trended down to 11. Given downward trend and current clinical status there is no concern for ACS. Demand ischemia was considered but cardiac echo performed on ___ showed that the left ventricular regional and global systolic functions are normal w\/ only mild aortic regurgitation. CKMB may be originating from brain tissue. -Continue lipitor, low dose aspirin, and metoprolol . # Brain imaging findings: There were initial concerns about vasculitis since MRI of brain on ___ that showed focal and confluent T2\/FLAIR hyperintensities in bilateral periventricular and subcortical white matter of bilateral cerebral hemispheres and pons.

So, rheumatology was consulted for evaluation of vasculitis, especially given her hx of + ___. She also had a MRA brain on ___ was not c\/w vasculitis. Rheum panel was sent w\/ only abnormality being anticardiolipin antibody IgM elevated to 16.2, which may occur with vasculitis, SLE or ACA syndrome. However rheumo does not think that pt's findings are consistent with vasculitis. . # Drug rash: Due to dilantin given timing of rash with dilantin administration. Allergy list updated - Hold dilantin . # Blurry vision: Pt c\/o \"foggy vision at times\" which has been happening since surgery. She with normal visual acuity. She was also evaluted by neuro and had multiple head images which did not show an anatomical abnormality. This does not appear to be an acute issue. The other potentially cause could be optic neuritis due to MS. ___ has not been r\/o yet as the MRI findings are some what suggestive. - she will be followed by neuro . # SKIN: pt with a small healing ulcer on submandibular are and scab on posterior occipital area.

Heart attacks are caused by blockages in the coronary arteries that supply the heart muscle, whose pumping function depends on a constant supply of oxygen delivered by the blood supplied by these arteries. Severe blockages in the coronary arteries can cause the symptoms that you experienced because they deprive your heart of oxygen. During this hospitalization, the blockage in your coronary arteries that were causing your symptoms was opened during a procedure called a cardiac catheterization. During this procedure, a device called a stent was placed in the blocked artery to open the artery, restore blood flow through the artery and, in turn, restore oxygen supply to your heart muscle. This procedure should help to improve your symptoms and prevent future heart attacks. The catheterization, however, is only one part of your treatment; the other part of your treatment is your new medication regimen."}

Based on history, suggestive of upper source (also BUN\/Cr ratio quite high), possible ulcer, especially in light of chronic prednisone use. However, the patient was adamant that she did not want an EGD or colonoscopy. This was discussed with her family as well. She understood the risks of forgoing endoscopy. She felt like she was too old and did not want any interventions. She continued to have melena throughout her hospital stay, but her H\/H stabilized. She received a total of 3 units pRBCs and 1 unit of platelets during this hospital stay. Her most recent blood transfusion was on ___ and from then until discharge on ___, her H\/H remained stable and she was hemodynamically stable. Her warfarin was held on discharge until she can follow up with her PCP. This was discussed with the patient and she understood that there is a risk of stroke off warfarin. # ___ Baseline Cr ~1.4-1.5, presented with 2.0.

Patient was bolused IV fluids and SBP improved to 130s. After BP improved, her mental status returned to baseline. Neuro exam at this time was unremarkable, as was abdomen, cardiovascular and respiratory exams. EKG revealed mild sinus bradycardia, unchanged from prior. VBG notable for elevated CO2 but likely in setting decreased respiration during episode. CT head WO contrast was without acute findings. 24-hour EEG was reassuring against seizure activity. Hypotension could be related to NPO status and initiation of low dose amlodipine, although would not expect such a quick response to anti-hypertensive. On review of previous notes and in talking to niece, patient does have history of possible orthostasis as well as autonomic dysfunction, and niece notes several of these similar unresponsive episodes at home over the past few months. Orthostatic vital signs were positive but did not correct with fluid resuscitation and therefore think patient may have some underlying autonomic instability leading to these episodes. Also concern for possible non-convulsive seizure vs post-ictal state (which could also lead to autonomic dysfunction) given patient has history of seizures. Patient did not have any incontinence or tongue biting. Obtained 24hour EEG which was unremarkable. Of note, her Keppra was dose-adjusted given her persistent ___ and this will need to be monitored as an outpatient. Patient has scheduled follow up with neurologist. # Near fall at home, concern for presyncope # History of vasovagal syncope Patient presents after a third episode of presyncope. Likely etiology is combination of dehydration in patient with bradycardia on beta blocker. Neurology was consulted in ED and mentioned a well-documented h\/o vasovagal\/neurocardio syncope but unclear where this has been documented. Despite seizure hx, neuro not concerned for seizure as etiology (previous seizures have occurred iso acute illness eg volvulus\/infection). Unlikely infection given no leukocytosis, afebrile, negative U\/A. Orthostatics in ED were reportedly negative. Patient not hypoglycemic on admission, although patient is on a sulfonylurea so higher risk of low sugars. Patient noted bradycardic with HR in ___ on metoprolol, so may have contributed to presentation. No PR prolongation or e\/o heart block on EKG. Last TTE was ___, had LVEF 30%. Troponin negative. Also was some concern for hypothyroidism given patient always turns AC off per niece, but TSH normal. No chest pain or hypoxia to suspect PE. Patient at baseline mental status per niece. Patient was monitored on telemetry during stay. TTE was not repeated because thought unlikely to be high yield given no murmur on exam. Patient's home metoprolol was held as below. # Bradycardia - NSR in ___, concern for possible symptomatic bradycardia as above. No PR prolongation or e\/o heart block on EKG. Trop negative, TSH normal. Patient was monitored on tele. Home metoprolol was held as patient was likely symptomatic from bradycardia. Plan to hold on discharge for patient to discuss with PCP. HR has been stable in 50-60s. # Hypertension Patient hypertensive to 220\/90 upon arrival to the floor, has intermittently been so throughout prior admissions. Likely not acute, will plan to only lower by ~20% to SBPs 160-170s. IV hydralazine 10 x1 with subsequent drop to 90\/50s. Patient's goal BP while inpatient was 160-170s\/90s. Home lisinopril 40mg qd was held iso ___. As per above, she was briefly trialed on Amlodipine 5mg but the patient became subsequently hypotensive - as such, this was discontinued. If remains hypertensive at PCP follow up, consider reinitiation of an anti-hypertensive. CHRONIC ISSUES: =============== # Normocytic anemia: Hb 9.2 on admission, at prior baseline.

Neuro consulted, not concerned for seizure on presentation. Had an EEG which was reassuring. # Chronic, intermittent diarrhea: Symptoms are unchanged as per patient's niece. Continued home loperamide prn # T2DM: Last A1c 7.7% ___. On glipizide at home. Repeat A1c on admission was 7.5. Held glipizide while inpatient and also considering discontinuing medication given risk of hypoglycemia.

Patient is having symptoms consistent with return to atrial fibrillation\/flutter. He has been hemodynamically stable during this hospitalization. As INR subtherapeutic and procedure was initially being considered, patient was started on heparin gttWe consulted EP in morning after the patient was admitted. Their recommendation was to medically manage with sotalol and serial EKGs to monitor for prolonged QT. We therefore discontinued the diltiazem gtt in the setting of brady-arrhythmias on telemetry. The patient remained asymptomatic throughout this hospitalization. We continued home warfarin and closely followed ___. The patient was started on 80mg BID of sotalol, monitored for QT prolongation (QTc's of 0.47-0.48), which were WNL and on the morning of discharge the patient's dose was escalated to 120mg BID, and again monitored for QT prolongation; QTc prior to discharge was 0.46. . # CORONARIES: The patient has no known history of hyperlipidemia. We continued the patient on his home dose of aspirin. . # PUMP: The patient has mildly depressed systolic function on last echocardiogram. We continued the patient on his home dose of lisinopril. We initially held the patient's metoprolol in the setting of diltiazem gtt. The diltiazem drip was discontinued after roughly 8 hours in order to begin rate control therapy with sotalol. . # HYPERTENSION: Continue home lisinopril. Holding metoprolol in the setting of sotalol. Given the patient's borderline bradycardia, we held the metoprolol at discharge, with the patient to follow up with his cardiologist about possibly restarting the metoprolol in the future. .

He completed the ___ 21 hour protocol. He was asymptomatic from the standpoint of this ingestion, and he continued to deny that it was a suicide attempt. He was evaluated by psychiatry, who did not feel as though he was a suicide risk on this admission. # S\/P assault, throat and back pain: He reported improvement in his left upper extremity strength, which he had initially noted to be decreased after the assault. MRI of the C-spine and T-spine did not demonstrate any evidence of cord compression or other structural abnormality to account for these symptoms. Additionally, he reported persistent change in his voice and difficulty swallowing liquids after being attacked and struck on his neck. The patient was not noted by staff to be aspirating liquids or solids during his stay. The patient remained concerned over the presence of a lumbar vertebral fracture. We offered to evaluate the lumbar spine with plain films, given his history of chronic low back pain exacerbated in the setting of recent assault, but he declined as he felt the team would not change their opinions. Of note, he became agitated and aggressive towards staff when we refused to provide a prescription for narcotic pain medication upon discharge. # Drug seeking behavior This decision to attempt to avoid narcotic medications was aided by discussion with his PCP (Dr. ___ at ___ ___) who reported that he had previously sought out additional narcotic pain medications following the amputation of his toe on the right foot (___). She reports that he untruthfully claimed to have not been given any pain medication upon discharge following this surgery in ___, and so she prescribed a small number of narcotic pain pills. She later received a call from his pharmacy, stating that he had in fact received narcotics from his surgeon, and had attempted to fill her prescription as well. This account, coupled with his behavior surrounding this issue, raised concerns for drug-seeking behavior on this admission. Additionally, he admits to using 3+ different pharmacies, and has multiple PCP's who he has seen over the last year. During the admission process, in attempting to reconcile his home medications, we received multiple very different lists of current medications from the patient, his multiple pharmacies, and his PCP of record, Dr. ___. As a result, it was very difficult to reconcile his medications, and the final list is correct to the best of our knowledge. He was discharged with a prescription for Ultram for control of back pain s\/p assault. # Hypertension: Well controlled on this admission.

She described losing her step upon getting out of bed, and had symptoms of lightheadedness at the time. She denied any loss of consciousness. For her orthostatic hypotension, patient at baseline is on midodrine. It is possible that ___ midodrine in combination with her beta blocker and lisinopril is contributing to her orthostatic hypotension. Patient is on chronic pred 5mg for PMR and there was initially a concern for possible adrenal insufficiency but this was ruled out (see below for more information). Patient also has peripheral neuropathy, and poor ambulatory function at baseline, both of which causes her gait to be unsteady as well. Patient denied any prior history of sudden LOC to suggest cardiac etiology. She also denied any palpitations or chest symptoms. She was monitored on tele without any notable cardiac events. Patient has a history of AF but remained in SR while she was hospitalized. There was no physical exam findings to suggest aortic stenosis. Hence, overall there is a low suspicion for structural heart disease. She denied any prior seizure history and was not post-ictal after her fall. ___ BP was in 120s-140s\/60s-70s prior to discharge and she was not orthostatic. All together, we believe patient suffered a fall in the setting of being on midodrine, and antihypertensives (lisinopril, metoprolol), in combination with poor balance\/peripheral neuropathy at baseline. Patient was continued on home midodrine on discharge, and after a discussion with her PCP, ___ lisinopril was discontinued and metoprolol decreased to 25mg XL daily. Patient will follow-up with PCP to determine whether she should have any other adjustments to her medication doses. #R\/o adrenal insufficiency: Patient is on chronic pred 5mg for PMR, and in the process of working up for her fall, an AM cortisol returned at 1.1. This was likely artifact. We obtained a repeat cortisol, which returned as 15 and is more consistent with prior cortisol levels in our system. This repeat cortisol level was also drawn at a more appropriate time of the day. Given that patient did not have any orthostasis, without sodium or glucose abnormalities, and absence of other adrenal insufficiency symptoms, this level is likely a laboratory error. Patient was able to ambulate without any dizziness or other symptoms. This questionable cortisol result was communicated with outpatient PCP via phone call, who agreed that it is likely a non-issue. We continued patient back on home prednisone for her PMR upon discharge. #Acute blood loss anemia: Patient developed acute blood loss anemia in the setting of her fall and developing a large R flank hematoma. Hgb on discharge was 7.6 (baseline ___. She did not have any active evidence of bleeding on discharge, and her CT did not show any active extravasation. Patient will follow-up with her PCP, and should have her CBC repeated as an outpatient. #R flank\/extrathoracic hematoma: Patient suffered a fall and developed a large R flank hematoma. A CT scan showed the flank\/extrathoracic hematoma was 18 x 12 x 4.3cm without any evidence of active extravasation. This was progressively resolving and improved at the time discharge. #L radial fracture, R midshaft clavicle fracture: Patient with fractures from prior fall in ___ and is s\/p by ortho.

MRI of the spine demonstrated multi-level degenerative disc disease associated with severe canal and foraminal stenosis in the lumbar spine. Serum studies have been notable for hematological abnormalities, elevated inflammatory markers, and elevated CK and LFTs that are tending toward normal. The degenerative changes in the lumbosacral spine could certainly be playing a prominent role in the lower extremity weakness. The quickly and spontaneously normalizing CKs (even while on a statin) seem to point away from a primary muscle process (e.g. inclusion body myositis).

Wide differential with negative work-up included: hepatitis (viral abs negative), medication effect (statin held initially), a\/calculous cholecystitis (would expect leukocytosis and higher LFTs; further RUQ U\/S on ___ negative), or parasitic infection (smear negative). LFTs downtrended to within normal limits and her statin was restarted. However, upon restarting atorvastatin 80mg, her LFTs were beginning to trend up again. She previously tolerated atorvastatin at a dose of 20mg, so upon discharge, atorvastatin was reduced to 40mg. LFTs should be repeated after several days of the decreased dose. # Periorbital edema \/ erythema: Likely due to fluid overload \/ hypoalbuminemia. Negative screening tests for inflammatory disease \/ multiple myeloma. ================= INACTIVE ISSUES ================= # Congestive Heart Failure: Diastolic dysfunction with recent LVEF 40% on ___ TTE.

We performed an extensive work-up that showed evidence of a recent stroke, a likely pneumonia, and small areas of abnormal discharges on EEG brain monitoring which may put ___ at risk for seizures. ___ did not require any additional medications for your stroke because ___ already taking the appropriate ones. ___ completed a course of antibiotics for your pneumonia. Finally, ___ started an antiseizure medication called Keppra. After your stroke, when eating or drinking, food would sometimes go down the wrong pipe and into your lungs. Because of this, ___ received feedings through a tube that goes directly to your stomach. In the ED, they also found that your troponin levels were elevated. Troponin is an enzyme that indicates how much stress the heart is experiencing. Because another heart-specific laboratory test (CK-MB) was normal and because your EKG did not show any new changes, we did not think that ___ were having a heart attack. Instead, we think your heart was just stressed from the underlying infection and stroke. Additionally, in the ED, they found that your liver enzymes were elevated. We did an ultrasound of your abdomen that showed a normal liver and gallbladder. Your gallbladder did have gallstones, which are common in older individuals, but they were not blocking anything. We also checked for possible infections that could cause this, such as hepatitis, but those tests were negative. The liver enzymes decreased to their normal levels after a few days, however, and there is no evidence of any liver problems anymore. Thank ___ for choosing the ___ for your care."}

{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: ___ yo female with CKD, HTN, diastolic CHF, AF on coumadin, s\/p nephrectomy, chronic right pleural effusion with pleurex catheter in place, and chronic bilateral massive edema presents with leg erythema consistent with cellulitis. Course complicated by new diagnosis of lung cancer, acute on chronic renal failure, acute on chronic CHF exacerbation, anemia and thrombocytopenia ACTIVE ISSUES: # CELLULITIS: Unilateral erythema and warmth in right leg consistent with infection. She was initially started on broad coverage with IV vancomycin on ___ and was narrowed on ___ to doxycycline with very good effect. She finished a 7 day course of doxycycline on ___ # ADENOCARCINOMA OF THE LUNG: Pleural fluid cytology was consistent with adenocarcinoma of the lung. Thus, the effusion was likely partially malignant in nature. She will likely not pursue further therapy but will follow-up with oncology as an outpatient to discuss options. # PLEURAL EFFUSIONS: Multifactorial. Pleural fluid studies were mostly consistent with transudate but LDH elevated suggesting exudate. Initially attributed to acute on chronic diastolic heart failure but patient failed to improve with diuresis. Diagnosis of lung cancer was then made from the cytology thus suggesting the effusion could be partially malignant in nature. She was initially diuresed aggressively with IV lasix and effectively lost volume, but effusions did not improve much, likely as they were partially malignant in origin. She already had a pleural catheter in place on the right so this was drained multiple times during her hospitalization for 300-500cc each time. Given her persistent left effusion despite diuresis this was drained by thoracentesis with a total of 1.2L removed. She experienced good relief initially, but unfortunately the effusion reaccumulated quickly, so IP placed a pleurex catheter on ___ for periodic drainage at rehab and at home. Her lasix was initially increased but then decreased back to her home dose at discharge. New dry weight is ~62.1kg. # ANEMIA AND THROMBOCYTOPENIA: Noted incidentally to have a decrease in platelets from previously normal values to 60-70K on admission, which appears to have developed in ___. She also had a slow decrease in her hemoglobin\/hematocrit over that time period and some positive markers of hemolysis, including a positive coomb's test. Given these two findings, it was thought that she may have ___ (warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia). Hematology was consulted and reviewed her smear, which was not consistent with hemolytic anemia, so they thought anemia may be due to chronic slow blood loss (esp given coumadin use). Thrombocytopenia thought to be ITP vs drug-induced, so ranitidine was stopped since that is a medication that can have this effect. Platelets improved to >100K on discharge. She will follow up with hematology on ___ and should have her CBC monitored at her next PCP ___. # ACUTE ON CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE: Cr up to 1.8 from baseline ~1.4 on admission. Likely due to cardiorenal syndrome and venous congestion, as creatinine actually improved back to baseline with diuresis. INACTIVE ISSUES BY PROBLEM: # ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: Coumadin held intermittently during hospitalization for planned procedures such as the thoracentesis and pleurex placement, but it was restarted on discharge. She should have her next INR on ___ at rehab. # CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE: Plavix held prior to pleurex placement. Since patient's last stent was in ___ and is on coumadin, plavix was dc'ed on discharge. Continued on statin and metoprolol. Not on aspirin due to allergy. # HYPOTHYROIDISM: Continued on home dose of levothyroxine TRANSITIONS OF CARE: - CHF: dc'd on lasix 40mg daily (home dose), needs daily weights (dry weight 62.1kg) - Pleural effusions: pleurex catheters now bilateral (left placed ___, should be drained 3x\/weekly at least or as symptoms arise - Anemia and thombocytopenia: should have CBC at next PCP appt after discharge from rehab. Follow up with hematology on ___ - Anticoagulation: restarted coumadin after pleurex procedure, should have next INR on ___. ___ clinic will manage dosage after discharge from rehab - FULL CODE though this should be re-addressed given patient's new cancer diagnosis","summary":"You were admitted to the hospital due to an infection in your leg, which improved with antibiotics. We also found that you had a lot of extra fluid in your lungs, which we removed with furosemide and by draining it with a needle.

{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: ___ yo man with DM, HTN, and recent seizure in the setting of hyperglycemia was admitted with a cough and shortness of breath due to pneumonia and volume overload in the setting of congestive heart failure recently off diuretics as well as acute on chronic renal failure. . 1. Pneumonia: Patient was treated for viral vs. bacterial (more likely given focal findings on CXR and recent hospitalization) pneumonia. He initially received Tamiflu until influenza A and B negative results were obtained. Given recent hospitalization, he also received ceftaz\/vancomycin for hospial acquired pneumonia for 3 days. After being afebrile for 48hrs with negative cultures, patient was transitioned to high dose Levofloxacin (adjusted for renal function) for 5 days. He was discharged with 2 additional days of 250mg PO QD to be completed on ___. Various evaluations were used to define the pathogen without success. A sputum specimen was determined to be contaminated by upper respiratory secretions. A urine legionella ag was negative and liver function tests were within normal limits. . 2. Diastolic cardiac dysfunction: Patient has chronic disease thought to be a major contributor to his respiratory distress given clinical setting of recently discontinued diuretic, depedent pulmonary crackles, and visibly volume overloaded with 1+ pitting edema to the knee. He has a history of diastolic heart failure with EF of 65-70% on last ECHO. Torsemide was discontinued during and after last hospitalization out of concern for dehydration. After admission, patient was diuresed with escalating doses of diuretics. Patient was discharged at a weight of 180lbs. Baseline weight was previously reported as 178lbs. He was discharged on his home torsemide dose of 20mg PO daily. Patient will be followed with ___, weight monitoring, dietary instructions, and multiple follow-up appointments. . 3. Acute on chronic renal failure: Patient has with chronic kidney insufficiency (baseline crt 2.2 in the inpatient setting, but outpatient baseline of 3.0 according to ___ records thought to reflect more accurate baseline). His creatinine increased likely related to dehydration with insensible losses poor oral intake with current illness, this is moderately supported by a BUN:Cr ratio of close to 20:1. Negative eosinophiluria, lack of predominant fever, and minimal urine white and red blood cells argued against acute interstitial nephritis. Throughout admission he his blood pressure was monitored, nephrotoxins were avoided, and his medications were renally dosed. His allopurinol and valsartan medications were held during the admission in the setting of ARF to prevent exacerbation. Prior to discharge his valsartan was restarted at a lower dose (from 160mg\/d to 40mg\/d) per renal consultation. At admission his Cr increased to 3.5 on ___ and then decreased to 2.9 and 3.0 prior to Discharge which is felt to be the patient's baseline. The patient will be called by his primary nephrologist's office to schedule follow up. . 4. Anemia: Patient demonstrated normocytic anemia. The hematocrit decreased from baseline throughout admission, likely related to phlebotomy and EPO deficiency secondary to renal disease. Hematocrit dropped throughout admission with a nadar of 23.4. On ___ anemia labs revealed TIBC of 173, Ferritin of 151, TRF of 133. We initiated iron supplementaiton to improve anemia and demonstrate persistent anemia despite Ferritin>200 and Transferrin Sat>20% in order to allow patient to qualify fro EPO treatment in the future. A follow-up appointment was arranged with Dr. ___ at ___. There anemia of chronic disease, inflammation, and phlebotomy components. Patient continued on iron supplementation, may consider EPO with Nephrologist on outpatient basis. . 7. Diabetes mellitus, type II: Patient has poorly controlled diabetes with a HgbA1C of 10.1 on ___ and previous seizure episode thought to be precipitated by hyperglycemia. While in the hospital he recieved between ___ glargine at night and a sliding scale. Blood sugars ranged from 64-280 and were consistently in the 200s and low 300s by ___, except in the mornings after we increased Insulin to 15U Glargine QHS. When patient's evening glargine dose was increased to 15U his morning finger sticks decreased to 60-95. He was returned to his home dose of glargine, 9U QHS prior to discharge for fear of hypoglycemia given reported past episodes and concerns that sugars were more elevated than normal for patient in the setting of infection. His insulin regimen should be addressed in the outpatient setting given difficulty titrating dosing in the setting of infection. We continued aspirin and ___ given their benefit in diabetic patients. . 7. Seizure: There was concern for a recent seizure episode thought to be precipitated by hyperglycemia. Patient did not demonstrate signs or symptoms consistent with seizure activity throughout his admission. He did not receive any anti-epileptic medications. He has follow up with neurology. . 8. Hypertension: Patient was continued on minoxidil and metoprolol per his home dosing regimens. Valsartan was decreased per renal consult, to be re-evaluated at follow up appointment. . 9. Hyperthyroidism (due to chronic kidney disease): This patient was kept on zemplar for secondary hyperparathyroidism. . 10. Gout: Held allopurinol given ARF and lack of symptoms.

Cytologic evaluation was negative for malignant cells and no microorganisms were seen on gram stain or culture. After the procedure her pain had improved, though not completely. Our team believed this was most likely due to the multiple cysts that were not drained. We spoke extensively with the patient regarding the utility of further aspiration procedures. We noted that is very difficult to determine which cysts are generating her pain and that the cysts can re-accumulate fluid. Also explained the risk of infection and bleeding with each additional procedure. Given that her pain was \"tolerable\", she elected to defer any additional procedures at this time. We told her this can be readdressed as an outpatient if her pain level changes. Additionally, patient had diarrhea for ___ days after her procedure. This was likely related to an overly aggressive bowel regimen which was started given her presenting complaint of constipation. She was sent home with a bowel regimen to use as needed.","summary":"You were having abdominal pain. An imaging study of your belly showed many large fluid collections known as \"cysts\".
