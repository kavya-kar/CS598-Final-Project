His deficits quickly improved but overnight on ___ he did have some worsening of LLE weakness which had resolved by the morning. Repeat ___ showed no change in size or extent of the hemorrhage. He was continued on lamotrigine at a slightly higher dose (175 mg\/150 mg from 150 mg BID) concerning the possibility of increased seizure activity related to the hemorrhage. Given concerns regarding the nature of his hemorrhage, he had an MRI Brain with contrast which (other than the hemorrhage) showed no underlying obvious mass or vascular malformation. Given his stable neurological examinations and hemodynamic stability, he was transferred to the floor wards of the Neurology unit. Neurosurgery was consulted to perform a diagnostic cerebral angiogram to identify a possible arteriovenous dural fistula or other cerebral vascular malformation as a possible etiology of his two hemorrhages. This was done following the administration of steroids, H1 and H2 blockers as well as a bicarbonate preparation given his 1) chronic kidney disease with Cr 1.7-1.8, and 2) history of iodine contrast allergy. This also unfortunately did not identify an etiology of his intraparenchymal hemorrhages. This procedure was complicated a small groin hematoma that was not noticeable the next day. His peripheral pulses remained constant. He did complain of some local right sided hip pain which was limiting motion of his right lower extremity. We obtained hip films and a lumbar spine MRI which showed no acute injury, fracture or radicular\/plexus lesion, which was reassuring. He also reassured us that he has had problems with hip pain in the past. On the day of his discharge, he was able to ambulate with one assist. His foley catheter was discontinued. His pain was well controlled with PO analgesics and he obtained good relief from his pain following one dose of IV toradol.

{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: Ms. ___ is a ___ yo F with history of dementia, hypertension, and other medical conditions presented with presyncope on ___ and discharged on ___ # Presyncope. This was thought to be result of orthostatic hypotension secondary to hypovolemia from recent diarrhea and decreased oral intake. This is likely the reason for her fall. She was ruled out for acute intracranial bleeding, acute coronary syndrome, acute bleeding (guaiac negative), and pneumonia. She remained diarrhea-free while in the hospital. Her initial UA was equivocal, but repeat showed persistent pyuria with few bacteria. However, she was without any urinary symptoms. Urine culture is currently pending, but treatment may not be necessary if she continues to be asymptomatic. Initially she had evidence of orthostatic hypotension on vital signs, but it resolved after receiving about ___ Liters of IV fluid. Home lasix and lisinopril were held. Her metoprolol succinate was lowered to 25 mg daily, and she tolerated well. She remained asymptomatic throughout her stay. She was strongly encouraged to increase her oral intake of fluids to improve her hydration. Ensure was added to her diet after discussing with nutrition. Physical therapy was consulted and thought patient does not require home ___. She was discharged without lasix or lisinopril and with lowered dose of metoprolol succinate 25 mg daily. She was instructed to follow up with her new primary care physician, during which time, she should have repeat electrolytes, creatinine, and Hct repeated. # Acute on chronic renal failure. Patient was noted to have elevated creatinine, although close to her baseline of 1.8. It was likely pre-renal with FeNa of 0.98% and improved with hydration. Her lasix and lisinopril were held. Her medications were dosed renally. Her discharge creatinine was 1.7. Her nephrologist, Dr. ___, was informed of her admission. She should have her renal function followed up by her primary care physician. # Dementia. While in-house, patient was noted to have memory problems that raised concern for her home safety. Strong recommendations were made to both the patient and the family that there are safety concerns for her with the progressing dementia. She was recommended to be discharged home with her daughter, ___, with ___. They family and the patient were recommended to discuss the next step in managing her dementia with her primary care physician in follow up. # HTN. Because of the initial hypotension and the acute on chronic renal failure, her antihypertensives were discontinued. Her blood pressure remained within acceptable range without while in house. The plan is not to restart her on lasix. Her primary care physician can reassess her blood pressure in follow-up with possible re-initiation of lisinopril given her history of coronary artery disease and orthostatic hypotention as improved blood pressure control can often prevent orthostatic hypotension. # Normocytic anemia. This was thought to be result of her chronic renal failure. Patient's hematocrit was slightly lower than her baseline of around 33. She was guaiaced negative with normal rectal exam while in-house. There was no signs of acute bleeding. Of note, she did lose her IV line the evening prior to her discharge and led to some bleeding locally from the insertion site. However, her discharge hematocrit remained stable. It will be important for this to be followed up in the outpatient setting and age appropriate screening should be done. # Gout. Stable. Patient's allopurinol dose was changed to 100 mg once every other day given the underlying renal disease. She was discharged on this new schedule. This can be followed up by her primary care physician. # H\/o coronary artery disease. Stable. She was ruled out while in the hospital. She continued with home simvastatin 40 mg daily and baby aspirin 81 mg daily. Her metoprolol succinate dose was decreased to 25 mg daily given orthostatic hypotension and prevention of excessive beta blockade. Her lisinopril was held because of acute renal failure. However, it will be important for her blood pressure to be reassessed at follow-up as lisinopril can be benefitial for patients with coronary artery disease. # Diarrhea.

{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: Hospital Course per Neurology: Ms. ___ was admitted overnight ___ to neurology service. She had an initial NIHSS of 4, but the outside hospital elected not to pursue thrombolysis. Her symptomatology could be consistent with a lacunar stroke, however she cannot receive MRI with DWI, due to a non-MRI compatible implant placed by ___ Pain Clinic for post-herpetic neuralgia. She was started on heparin gtt for atrial flutter, and had supra-therapeutic PTT's. A UA returned overnight, which was consistent with UTI and the pt. was atrted on ceftriaxone. On physical exam ___ a.m. she was found to have diffuse edema, ascites, an S3 and was given an extra dose of lasix. It was felt her weakness was actually isolated right deltoid weakness, and her dysarthria was partially secondary to titubation. A medicine consult was obtained to assist in managing what appears to be CHF exacerbation and UTI with the possibility of a lacunar stroke. Hopsital course on Medicine: Pt was admitted to the medicine floor and her deficits began to improve. She initially was dyspneic requiring 2L O2 with diffuse wheezing and bibasilar crackles. Given one dose of lasix but later held given low BP (goal was to keep SBP>120 in order to maintain brain perfusion). She was given nebulizer treatment which improved her breathing. On the second day, she was weaned to room air and had O2 sats 94-95% with much more comfortable breathing. It is likely that COPD and CHF are both contributing to baseline dyspnea for her and her exacerbation was likely due to not having taking her meds on day of admission. On dishcarge her lungs were still slightly wheezy and she responded well to nebulizers (ipratropium). No pulm edema or leg edema clinically. Speech\/swallow, physical therapy, occupational therapy were all following and recommendations followed. Renal function was improving after transfer to medicine (Cr 1.4-->1.2), Foley was removed, and we continued treating for UTI (urine culture + E coli), switching from ceftriaxone to ciprfloxacin (cipro total of 3 days). Acute renal insufficiency likely ___ poor forward flow and UTI, baseline not known but trending down prior to discharge. Pt had one episode of a flutter on neurology floor which resolved with IV lopressor. She was continued on metoprolol 25mg TID and monitored on telemetry. She had no further episodes and HR was ___. We discussed at length between the primary team and neurology service the benefit vs risk of starting her on anticoagulation therapy with heparin brdiging to coumadin. A TTE showed no source of cardiac emboli. It was decided that her stroke was most likely lacunar and not embolic in nature and given no history of arrhythmia and no source on TTE and limited nature of atrial flutter (not atrial fibrillation) that anticoagulation therapy would not be beneficial given increased bleeding risk. She was started on aggrenox for secondary stroke prevention and should follow up with neurology at ___ (appt pending).","summary":"You were admitted to ___ with right arm weakness, right face droop, and slurred speech and found to have a stroke. A CT scan of your head did not show any bleeding or clots in vessels. You did not receive tPA therapy because it was not within the time window for lytic therapy. You were admitted to the neurology floor and then transferred to the medicine floor after developing some shortness of breath. You were also found to have a urinary tract infection. On the medicine floor, we gave you lasix to take some fluid off your lungs and nebulizer treatments to help your breathing. It seems that you have elements of heart failure and COPD that contribute to your difficulty breathing and you responded very well to the nebulizer treatments. We treated your urinary tract infection with ciprofloxacin which you should continue for 2 more days after you leave the hospital. Your renal function has been improving during your stay and we have been holding your lasix now because your lungs sound dry. Your urine grew E coli and we started you on ciprofloxacin for the infection. Right after your admission you also had atrial flutter, an arrhythmia in your heart rate which resolved with IV metoprolol. You did not have any more episodes on the floor. Initially we started you on blood thinners (heparin and coumadin) because we were concerned that your stroke may have been from a thrombus in your heart (embolic). However, an echo was done and did not show a source for embolus and the neurology team believes your stroke was a lacunar one (meaning a small vessel stroke from chronic hypertension). Because you did not have any more episodes of arrhythmia, we decided it wasn't worth the risk to start you on anticoagulation with such a low chance for an embolic event in the future. We did start you on aggrenox, another kind of blood thinner which you should take to prevent recurrence of your kind of stroke. You should also take a rate controlling medication called metoprolol (37.5mg three times a day) to prevent arrhythmias."}
{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: ___ yo F w history of breast cancer x2, s\/p prophylactic bilateral salpingo-oopherectomy, history of ___ syndrome in the 1970s without residual neurologic deficits and previous severe left lower extremity cellulitis in ___ treated at ___ admitted with severe left foot and shin cellulitis in the setting of tinea pedis infection. #Left foot and left leg cellulitis: Patient initially presented with cellulitis, fever, and leukocytosis and was initially treated with Vancomycin and Unasyn. However, patient developed a drug rash to Unasyn which had happened to her previously. Unasyn was changed to Vancomyin and Meropenem and the patient clinically improved with improvement in rash, reduced pain and swelling, resolution of fever, and normalization of white blood cell count. The patient was seen by the Infectious Disease service who recommended changing to Linezolid to continue a 10 day course of po Linezolid following discharge to end ___. DVT was ruled out with lower extremity duplex ultrasound. Arterial duplex studies were read preliminarily as normal with final read pending at discharge. #Tinea Pedis: It was felt that maceration between ___ and ___ toes due to tinea infection was the cause of the patient's cellulitis. Given the mildly elevated in aminotransferase levels (see below), the patient was instructed to discontinue topical terbinafine (which she had been taking prior to admission) and the patient was prescribed clotrimazole cream to take for at least a two week course with ultimate course to be determined by PCP as she may benefit from indefinite topical antifungals given her recurrent infections leading to severe cellulitis. Patient was instructed not to start antifungal cream until she has completed her Linezolid to avoid any drug-drug interactions. Patient was instructed to follow up with her PCP since if the fungal infection is not treated appropriately with topical medication, she may benefit from systemic therapy once she has completed her course of Linezolid. A1c was wnl. #Cough\/GERD: Patient experienced dry cough without shortness of breath during hospitalization which was felt to be due to GERD. She was started on PPI and was instructed to follow up with her PCP. #Transaminitis: The patient did not have liver chemistries checked on admission, but liver chemistries on the morning prior to initiation of Linezolid showed mild elevation in the ALT and AST with normal ALK and TB. It was felt this was most likely related to previous meropenem and unasyn use. As above, given that these labs were drawn prior to her first dose of Linezolid it was felt that the elevated liver chemistries were not due to Linezolid. The LFTs could potentially be due to topical terbinafine that the patient had been using prior to discharge, but this was felt to be less likely. The aminotransferase levels were not normal at discharge, but the patient was asymptomatic without fevers, abdominal pain, RUQ tenderness, or nausea. The patient was discharged to have these labs followed by her PCP and ___ ___ clinic with ___ to check labs and fax the information to ___ post ___ clinic the day prior to her follow up appointment. Patient was instructed to call her PCP if she experiences any abdominal discomfort, nausea, fevers, or jaundice. #CODE: FULL #Disposition: Patient was discharged home with ___ services for wound care and to have labs drawn prior to her post ___ clinic visit. She was also instructed to follow up with her PCP for her cellulitis, recurrent tinea infections, cough\/GERD, and elevated ALT\/AST.","summary":"You were admitted with cellulitis and seen by the Infectious Disease, Dermatology, and Rheumatology services.

{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: ___ Reason for Admission: ___ with h\/o chronic pericarditis, anxiety disorder, no prior seizure history, presents now with ___ chest pain and concern for new seizure. . Active Problems: . # Pseudoseizure: Initial concern was for epileptic seizure and Neurology was consulted in the ED. MRI and EEG were performed (see results\/reports) and no evidence of epileptiform seizure was found. MRI did show nonspecific left frontal periventricular hyperintensity without enhancement, but the neurology service did not feel this could represent a cause of her symptoms. Thought was given to LP for possible demyelenating disease, but given the absence of focal neuro deficits separated in time and space, MRI finding was felt to be incidental and not indicative of an underlying demyelinating disease. There was no fever, leukocytosis or meningeal signs to suggest an infectious cause for her symptoms. Given her known anxiety disorder, histrionic behavior and negative workup, Psychiatry was consulted. Psych felt the patient may have an undertreated anxiety disorder and felt that in the absence of medical causes for her symptoms, conversion disorder vs somatization disorder were possible causes for her presentation. The patient's anxiety medications were increased (added Klonopin) and she seemed somewhat less anxious. Ultimately, Ms ___ was diagnosed with pseudoseizure and no medical cause for her presentation was found. She was encouraged to follow up with her PCP and to continue her outpatient psychiatric care. . # Chest Pain: The patient reported ___ chest pain, which is a chronic problem for her. She had previously been diagnosed with pericarditis, initially at ___, and is followed by Dr. ___ at ___ for her diagnosis of chronic pericarditis. On this admission, she stated her pain was exactly the same as the pain she has experienced with prior flares of her chronic \"pericarditis.\" She has had an extensive cardiac workup including repeated TTEs, multiple cardiac MRIs and a full rheumatologic workup without any evidence of pericarditis or connective tissue disorder. Troponins and CKBM were negative, and the suspicion for ACS was very low in this otherwise low risk young woman. On prior admissions, her chest pain has not responded to Toradol, NSAIDs or Colchicine. She does endorse a small amount of relief with a Fentanyl Patch and narcotic pain mediacations. Given she has had an extensive workup for her pain on multiple prior admissions, we did not pursue further diagnostic testing for her chest pain. She was given Oxycodone, a Fentanyl patch and benzodiazepines for her pain. . Chronic Problems: . # Eosinophilic Esophagitis\/Gastritis: Pt has no objective evidence of this on most recent GI biopsy. At this time, it does not appear that she meets the diagnostic criteria for eosinophillic esophagitis. . # Anxiety\/Insomnia: Patient has significant anxiety, which is likely a major contributing factor to her symptoms. She was continued on her home Ambien and Ativan and also given Klonopin. On the day of discharge, she was also given 5mg of Zydis, which seemed to help with her severe anxiety. . Transitional Issues: Prior to discharge, I talked to her outpatient pain physician and informed him of her hosptialization. He asked that I given her enough Fentanyl patches to last 2 weeks, at which time she could again be seen in pain clinic. Otherwise, he asked that I not provide additional narcot pain medications. She will follow up with Allergy\/Immunology and Psychiatry as well as her PCP and pain management doctor.","summary":"You were admitted for shaking episodes.

We increased it again to 1250mg the following day for the same reason. She had fewer episodes of twitching, but they were not fully controlled. We therefore increased the keppra on ___ to 1500mg BID. Her mental status returned quickly to baseline, but she continued to have left sided weakness, but it was unclear whether it was the same as baseline. She however was unable to walk as she used to at home, and therefore we obtained a Brain MRI which did not show any new strokes or acute processes. She had another twitching episode on ___ of unclear duration, we therefore increased her keppra to 1500mg BID. We placed her on LTM on ___, and it did not show any seizures. On admisison, we found she had a UTI on U\/A and therefore started her on bactrim. The culture showed mixed flora. We repeated the U\/A 5 days after starting the bactrim and it continued to be strongly positive.

{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: A ___ woman with Type 1 diabetes mellitus recently discharged from ___ re-presents with episodes of vomiting and RUQ pain # Vomiting\/Abdominal Pain: Differential was concerning for retained stone versus SMA syndrome. Retained stone was ruled out given normal LFTs and normal MRCP. SMA syndrome was under consideration since the patient had lost weight over the past couple months and endorsed post-feeding pain. However, CT scan and MRCP findings were not consistent with this diagnosis. Celiac sprue was also entertained given nausea, vomiting, and weight loss with abdominal pain but TTG-Ab were negative. ___ ___ syndrome was also considered in etiology for RUQ and pelvic exam was done that showed no cervical motion tenderness; GC and chlamydia were negative. Ultimately it was thought that her right upper quadrant pain was likely secondary to muscle strain in the setting of repeated vomiting; the vomiting was thought to be due to uncontrolled gastoparesis as well as a component of anxiety. Was given Ibuprofen with some resolution of her pain. To continue treatment of her gastroparesis, she was advised to eat smaller meals, avoid fatty foods, and maintain good control of her sugars. She was also given a small supply of Ativan to help reduce anxiety. She was scheduled for outpatient GI follow-up on the same day as discharge, for further management of her gastroparesis. # Type I diabetes mellitus, well-controlled, with complications: Followed at ___. Patient maintained on reduce standing insulin doses as her po intake was reduced. Her sugars were lower than normal and at times fell < 50.

Per patient not taking Aspirin. # Bipolar disorder: Continued home regimen of Quetiapine. # Seizure disorder: Continued home Tegretal. # Dispo: At time of discharge, was tolerating regular diet, with improvement in pain and no further vomiting. She was scheduled for follow-up appointments with gastroenterology and ___ clinic, as well as her primary care physician.","summary":"You were seen in the hospital for your vomiting and nausea. We did a test called MRCP and found that you had no abnormalities in your bile system. We also did a CT scan and did not find any abnormalities. The most likely cause for your right upper quadrant pain is likely muscle strain from repeated episodes of vomiting, since changes in position seemed to bring this pain on. Your vomiting is likely because of your gastroparesis. To improve gastroparesis, you should try to eat small meals. Large volumes of fluid or food can cause vomiting because of gastroparesis. Other things that you can do include avoiding fats (this can slow your stomach down) and keeping your sugars under control (high sugars also slow your stomach down). Please talk to your gastroenterologist about further assistance with your diet. Your sugars were low in the mornings while you were in the hospital.

{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: ==================================== PRIMARY REASON FOR HOSPITALIZATION ==================================== Mr. ___ is a ___ with DMII, CKD, HTN, afib on coumadin recently admitted to ___ for AKF and discharged to ___ rehab on ___ now readmitted to the ICU on ___ for GI bleed. He underwent ___ embolization of right sided colonic angiodysplasia on ___ and then was then found to have ischemic colitis on sigmoidoscopy on ___. He underwent right hemicolectomy on ___. He continued to have melena in the MICU and after transfer to the floor, with multiple workups to localize the bleeding, which did not show definitive results. His GIB gradually slowed down and stopped ___, and his hct remained stable over a course of several days. He no longer required blood transfusions at the time of discharge, and he was no longer producing melanotic stools. He was discharged to a long term acute care facility and will have further followup with GI, surgery, and ENT, Renal. ============== ACTIVE ISSUES ============== # GI Bleed: Patient at rehab with brbpr, dizziness and tachycardia. Upon arrival to the ED H\/H 6.4\/20.7 down from 8.3\/26.9 on the day prior. He received 7 units of pRBCs, 1 unit of FFP and INR was reversed with K centra. GI was consulted and requested a CTA abd\/pelvis, which did not localize the bleed. Flex sig was performed in the MICU and revealed mucosal ulceration consistent with ischemic injury thought secondary to hypotension in the setting of his recent shock. He continued to have extensive bloody\/melanotic stools requiring frequent transfusions and hypotension requiring pressor support. On ___ he went for an ___ guided angiography which showed right sided colonic angiodysplasia which was successfully embolized. He required intermittent blood transfusions over the next few days to keep his HGB >7, GI following. GI performed bedside sigmoidoscopy again on ___ which showed ischemic colitis. On the evening of ___ he began to once again have large-volume melena, was transferred back to MICU for management. He was taken to the OR ___ for R colectomy for ischemic colitis. Was given 5U PRBCs, 3U FFP in OR. Post-op continued to have melanotic bowel movements requiring intermittent transfusions. EGD was performed ___ and was negative, colonoscopy was planned but aborted as Hct then became stable. On ___ the patient was transferred back to the MICU service for persistent GI bleeding, hypotension and ___. Patient was intermittantly hypotensive that was responsive to fluids, but was overall hemodynamically stable. Over his MICU course he he was given a total of 7 units PRBCs as his H\/H were continuosly down trending. H\/H stabilized and patient was subsequently called out to the floor. After transfer to the floor, he underwent colonoscopy on ___, which showed no acute bleeding from the colon and was notable for an adenomatous polyp requiring outpatient followup and polypectomy. He also underwent tagged RBC scans x2 which did not show active bleeding. He started a capsule study which did not show definitive results because the capsule remained in his stomach. Toward the latter part of the week on ___, his GIB had gradually slowed down, and by ___, he had stopped having melenic stools. His hct remained stable at 25.6 on the day of discharge. He will followup with GI after discharge. Given his long course of GI bleeding of unknown source, his warfarin was held during his hospitalization and will continue to be held on discharge to rehab. Both the patient and his family understand the risks of the GI bleeding outweighing the benefits and have agreed to hold warfarin for now. He was started on 81 mg aspirin on ___. # Confusion\/Delirium Patient initially had nighttime delirium in the MICU. Patient was maintained on Seroguel 200mg qHS, tapered down to 100mg over several weeks. Attempted to minimize disturbances and encourage appropriate day\/night cycle. Continued to have altered mental status post-op, in the setting of increasing BUN, possibly due to uremia, although dialysis with a lower BUN did not improve his mental status. Was following commands intermittently, and more consistently after extubation #2. After transfer to the floor, patient required Seroquel infrequently and his confusion had resolved on the day of discharge. # Afib Upon admission, his INR was reversed and his home meds of coumadin, metop, dig and dilt were all held. Rate control agents were restarted with dose adjusted to maintain SBP 100-110 and HR 100-110. Cardiology consulted for aid in management. They concluded rhythm control would not be helpful given prior failed attempts. Will need further discussions to discuss restarting coumadin (currently being held). Post-op he continued to have afib with HR in the 100s, controlled initially on a dilt gtt and digoxin. POD 4 had increasing HR to 130s -> changed to amio gtt from dilt gtt then transitioned to PO amio with adequate rate control prior to discharge. # Nutrition Dobhoff was placed and the patient received tube feeds while PO intake was poor. The tube came out and was not replaced given respiratory distress and the need for face mask ventilation. PICC placed and TPN started and continued until ___. FEES ___ showed still not safe for thin liquids, although may do short trials. Failed speech and swallow again ___. TFs started ___, then restarted again ___. He pulled out his NG tube on ___ and refused NGT replacement. He was evaluated by speech and swallow via fiberoptic swallow study and placed on a honeythickened liquid and pureed solid diet. He tolerated this diet well. # Respiratory distress: Likely due to mucous plugging given inability to cough up secretions, acute onset of episodes of distress, and improvement with deep suctioning. LLL collpse persists in the wake of VAP. Aspiration another likely contributor. s\/p treatment for VAP\/Pseudomonas with cefepime (___). Treated with saline nebs, pulmonary toilet, humidified oxygen, chest ___ for secretions, and guaifenesin as mucolytic. Was exubated ___ -> then failed and reintubated ___ for worsening mental status. Was reextubated ___. After transfer to the floor, his secretions were cleared with suctioning. # Hoarse voice and vocal cord dysfunction: Since extubation, the patient has had hoarse voice. Per ENT, L vocal cord paralysis and mild loss of sensation. While this is likely age-related change combined with ETT injury, they do note that it could be neurologic deficit. If there is persistent recurrent laryngeal nerve injury, he would be a candidate for possible vocal cord medialization as an outpatient. His vocal cord dysfunction is contributing to his respiratory distress, as he has poor cough and ability to protect his airway. High aspiration risk. Voice now stronger, cough still impaired. Given possible tongue deviation and persistent difficulty swallowing, as well as FEES findings of persistent vocal cord dysfunction, performed MRI which did not show ischemia. Treated with high-dose reflux therapy, aggressive humidification with shovel mask and Q2-4 hr saline nebs, even if patient has no O2 requirement. # AoCKD: Significantly worsening ___ ___. FeNa 0.43%, renal u\/s ruled out R-sided hydro (L side not examined), Foley draining well. Held diuresis despite slight volume overload on exam. Of note, patient required CRRT for oliguric renal failure during last admission. Concern for poor forward perfusion causing ATN, although etiology of hypotension or AF with RVR is debatable. ___ d\/c tamsulosin and reduced Seroquel and metoprolol doses to maintain SBP > 100. per Cardiology, prefer no midodrine, maintain SBP 100 by reducing rate control medications if necessary and using pRBCs for hydration. CVVH post-op until ___, followed by intermittent lasix, converting from anuric to nonoliguric renal failure. Then HD ___, started autodiuresing thereafter and no longer required HD. After transfer to the floor, his creatinine continued to trend down to 1.6 on the day of discharge. # LUE DVT: Noticed ___ ___ swelling of LUE, where PICC is placed. DVT Confirmed by u\/s. Per Renal, no immediate plans for HD thus can switch to R arm. Resited PICC ___. New US ___ showed L axillary, subclavian, 1 of 2 brachial veins, and new cephalic vein DVT LUE. As GI bleed continued, no anticoagulation was started. ========================== RESOLVED ISSUES IN MICU ========================== # VAP: Concern for VAP given leukocytosis and fevers during intubation. Sputum growing Pseudomonas. Completed 2-week course cefepime ___ with resolution of leukocytosis and fever. # BPH: Currently with Foley for urinary retention. Unable to take tamsulosin via NGT, therefore voiding trial deferred pending ability to swallow pills. d\/c tamsulosin. # Unresponsive episode Patient with unresponsive episode on ___. It is unclear what happened but he has since resolved. Ddx includes seizure vs. stroke vs. hypoactive delirium. Per neurology, 20 minute EEG shows no seizures. Ultimately, neurology felt this was likely a hypoactive delirious episode. # Respiratory distress In the ED, patient felt to be clinically volume overloaded, as he was unable to lay flat. Given the need for massive transfusion of blood products, he was intubated and sedated. On ___, he was successfully extubated. # CKD Patient recently admitted for ___ (thought to be pre-renal in nature) improved to 1.6 upon day of discharge. Now returns with Cr at 1.4- seems to be at baseline. On day of admission, he underwent CTA and then underwent ___ angiography on ___. Cr initially was elevated in the setting of likely pre-renal due to GI bleed but downtrended with fluid rescusitation. # Diarrhea Patient with severe diarrhea on prior admission, felt to be mainly due to nutritional status. Was discharged on loperamide. Loperamide was held upon admission given his brbpr\/melanotic stools. C. diff negative ___. # Troponin Elevation On recent admission, patient with mild troponin elevation to .04 in the setting of ___. Now admitted with troponin elevatinon to .09 in the setting of GI bleed. EKG in the ED showed afib with new ST depressions in V2-V4 and slightly worsening ST depressions in V4-V6 from prior. Taken together, his troponemia likely represents demand ischemia in the setting of hypotension on top of known CKD. =============== CHRONIC ISSUES =============== # BPH: initially held tamsulosin as foley wasin place, then restrated # DMII: holding held metformin, on ISS # HLD: held simvastatin initially then restarted # Gout: initially held home allopurinol =================== TRANSITIONAL ISSUES =================== -discussion about restarting anticoagulation when he follows up with GI (he has DVTs in his arms, non occlusive, and Afib RVR CHADS=2), anticoag has been held in setting of GIB and when stable discussion can be made about restarting those agents - Patient has scheduled followup with GI, surgery, and ENT and renal - 7 mm right middle lobe lung nodule.

You were found to have pneumonia. Your pneumonia was treated with an antibiotic called levofloxacin. You had some lab tests called a blood cultures to check for bacteria. One of the blood cultures grew a type of bacteria called coagulase-negative staphylococcus. Due to this, you were briefly treated with an antibiotic called vancomycin. The infectious disease service was consulted and felt that the bacteria in the blood culture bottle was likely a contaminant rather than a true blood infection. Nonetheless, because you have an ICD, it is important to be certain that there is no blood infection. For this reason, you will need to have a set of blood cultures repeated when you follow up witih Dr. ___. You were found to be in atrial fibrillation. You told us that you had stopped taking amiodarone. Amiodarone was restarted. You should talk to Dr. ___ having your lung function checked while on amiodarone. You had some instability with walking. After working with a physical therapist, your stability improved. The physical therapist recommended that you continue physical therapy after you leave the hospital. However, you decided that you did not want this."}

She was taken to the OR on HD 1 with ortho spine for posterior fusion T3-T9, and placement of a right chest tube. She was kept intubated post-operatively and brought back to the TICU. Neuro: Her mental status was intact upon arrival to the hospital, and remained so throughout her hospital course. She had good pain control with IV narcotics while in the ICU. Her anti-epileptic medications were continued, and she did not have any seizure activity. After transfer from the ICU to the floor she initially had pain control issues which limited her participation with therapy. Her medications were adjusted and her participation has increased significantly. CV: Her blood pressure and heart rate were routinely monitored. Electrophysiology evaluated her pacemaker and found it to be functioning appropriately. Her home Lisinopril and Lasix were restarted. Her heart rate and blood pressures have remained stable. Resp: Her respiratory status was closely monitored given her multiple bilateral rib fractures. She was initially intubated for the OR and a right chest tube was placed for management of her hemopneumothorax.

He was admitted with acute hypercarbic respiratory failure with pCO2 73 (VBG) on admission. He required BiPAP in the ICU temprorarily - with improvement after treatment with antibiotics and steroids and nebulizers. The possible triggers would include pneumonia as well as medication non-compliance as ran out of inhalers several days PTA. There was likely pneumonia given leukocytosis, increased sputum production, and question of bilateral infiltrates on CXR. Because he had no recent hospitalizations, he was initially treated as if her had community acquired pneumonia with ceftriaxone, azithromycin. He was also given prednisone, duonebs standing, albuterol nebs PRN, and Advair. Ultimately he was switched to PO levoflox on ___ for a planned total 8 day course. Without oxygen, he desaturated to 80% particularly with exertion. He was intstructed to have oxygen on at all time given this consideration. The family also reported that he did much better with nebulizers (and did not work with inhalers well at home). For this reason, he was placed on Oxygen, given prescription for nebulizers. He can restart Tiotropium at discharge # Tachycardia: irreg\/irreg: during this admission, Mr. ___ had episodes of significant tachycardia - with heart rates as high ast 170s with exertion. EKG revealed afib (vs. MAT). There was no hypotension during these events. His oxygenation was optimized and he was placed on escalating dose of diltiazem. Ultimately, he was placed on 360 mg\/day of diltiazem with good response. His HR was largely ___ at rest, although would increase to 150 with exertion. The tachycardia was likely contributed by nebs and possible compouned by recent infection. The hope is that the afib is transient in the acute setting and that long-term anticoagulation can be avoided altogether (also fall risk). # BPH: Mr. ___ had an episode of urinary retention with BS 650cc. This was possibly compounded by constipation. He was placed on flomax, in addition to the finateride. he was also treated for his constipation. With this, regimen, he had good urine output with PVR in low 100 range.

Pain mostly nocturnal and during day today after HD. Etiology remains unclear. Pt without pain on admission after morphine in the ED. DDx includes constipation, ischemia after HD, transplant rejection. No signs currently of PD line infection. Repeat peritoneal dialysate cell count showed 31 WBCs, 905 RBCs, 10 PMNs, cultures negative. CMV viral load not detectable. Pt was seen by GI service, who felt that Pt may have some element of ischemia when hypotensive given extensive calcifications. GI recommended increased bowel regimen, metoclopromide for nausea \/ vomiting, and outpatient EGD if Pt remains symptomatic to r\/o gastritis \/ PUD. Peritoneal cultures negative. Pt was also seen by pain service, who made several recommendations (see below). Pt continued to have abdominal discomfort, though not pain with morphine PR and acquiesed to CTA abdomen to definitively examine mesenteric ischemia. CTA abdomen did not actually show any definitive evidence of mesenteric ischemia. Specifically, radiology felt pt had \"dense atherosclerotic calcification of the abdominal aorta and branch vasculature which remain patent on post-contrast phases. No flow-limiting stenosis. No evidence of enteric pathology, without evidence of bowel ischemia.\" Pt did have significant fecal loading on CT, which was also seen on non-contrast CT abdomen when she was previously admitted for similar symptoms. Taken together, her abdominal pain is most likely due to chronic constipation. Pt was confused regarding her symptoms of diarrhea, and it was explained to her that sometimes patients suffer from liquid loose bowel movements when they are actually constipated. She was discharged on an aggressive bowel regimen and Pt was instructed to use tap water enemas if she is not having at least one large bowel movement every day. # pain control regimen: Pt is very belligerent and states repeated that she \"cannot take any oral pain medication.\" She insists that she can only take IV medications, mainly IV morphine and states that her other doctors told ___ that she should \"go to the ER\" whenever she has pain for pain medications. She completely refuses to try any oral pain medications, stating that it will make her nauseated. She has also refused acetaminophen, which she reports taking at home for pain. She is upset that her morphine is diluted in 50mL NS and run over 15 minutes rather than given as IV push. Pain seems to be better by ___, but then worse again ___. Pt remained very belligerent and abusive toward staff. Pt was seen by chronic pain service, who recommended trial of tapentadol (a combination SSRI \/ opiate) at 50mg po tid prn pain. This medication is expected to have fewer nausea \/ vomiting side-effects than pure opiate, but this med is not available in hospital. Also recommended to take methadome 2.5mg po bid but Pt reported excessive drowsiness. Her methadone was therefore stopped, but kept morphine suppositories ___ PR q6 hrs PRN. Discussed with her local ___ pharmacy in ___, who said that they would definitely be able to supply. She was discharged on this medication in addition to her gabapentin 100mg po daily. Additionally, the cause of her abdominal pain is likely to be worsening constipation as explained above, and she was discharged on a strong bowel regimen and instructions to use tap water enemas as needed to have a bowel movement daily. In the future, she should be preferentially given morphine 5mg PR if she is having similar pain and avoid IV morphine. # Supratherapeutic INR: INR of 6.7 in the ED s\/p 2.5mg PO vitamin K. No clear indication for reversal but now will have to monitor closely for subtherapeutic INR given mechanical valve. INR initially down to 4.3 on ___, then back up to INR 6.1 on ___, INR 7.5 on ___, most likely due to levofloxacin administration. INR corrected to 3.2 on ___, Pt was dosed with 1mg warfarin, but INR down to 2.0 on ___, dosed 2.5mg warfarin and increased to 2.1 on ___. Dosed w\/ 4mg warfarin and INR increased to 3.7. Pt was discharged on 2mg po warfarin for the next two days w\/ INR checks every ___, ___ as previously and managed per ___ clinic. # Low grade temp: Tmax 99.6 at home. Not a true fever and no clear infectious source other than whole body pain. This could be representative of a viral illness with myalgias. Pt currently without pain so difficult to assess. Pt with abdominal pain that has been worked up. No signs of infection around HD line and PD line per surgery assessment. Pt finished course of Cephalexin yesterday for empiric treatment of possible superficial skin infection around PD catheter. Repeat CMV viral load undetectable. Chest XR w\/ new LLL infiltrate in comparison to CXR from last week. Pt completed course of azithromycin for possible pneumonia. # possible pneumonia: Pt with good O2 sat but new LLL infiltrate on chest XR relative to prior XR from 1 week ago. Pt reports having a chronic mild cough since ___ after her ICD placement. She has no leukocytosis or fever. However, Pt is reporting some non-specific malaise. Although this would technically be considered a hospital-acquired pneumonia, given her absence of symptoms, Pt was initially treated w\/ levofloxacin, but switched to azithromycin on ___ due to interaction w\/ warfarin. She completed a 5 day course without issue. # Pleural effusions: Pt was incidentally found to have pleural effusions R > L on her CT abdomen. This also noted on chest XR previously but seems to small to moderate based on CT scan. Pt was completely asymptomatic and per patient preference, we deferred diagnostic thoracentesis, but instructed Pt to have a follow-up chest XR in ___ weeks. If the effusion increases in size or does not resolve, we suggested that the patient have diagnostic thoracentesis to rule out exudative process. # Adnexal mass: Pt was incidentally found to have R adnexal cystic lesion ~ 3 x 4 cm, which was previously noted on a non-contrast CT. Pt states that she has known about this lesions for many years, ever since her hysterectomy. She reports that she was told by her gynecologist that it was benign and that she could have it removed if it ever became bothersome. Its size appears to have remained unchanged over several years based on her description. Pt deferred further workup for now, stating that she preferred to speak with her gynecologist. We reiterated the importance of her following through with this and suggested that she see her gynecologist soon and may need additional imaging or more invasive testing if her gynecologist were concerned.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM: =========================== . #Altered mental status: #Presumed toxic metabolic encephalopathy: Approximately one week of encephalopathy prior to admission. Neuro exam non-focal. Psych was consulted. Suspect that this represents delirium in the setting of UTI. Could also consider untreated depression given subacute anhedonia and lack of activity per discussion with family. Pt's level of agitation waxed and waned throughout course, further supporting diagnosis of delirium. MRI showed mild thickening and enhancement of the mid to posterior aspect of the falx. Neurology evaluated her and felt that this was likely incidental finding and did not warrant any further inpatient workup. Per psychiatry recommendations, she was started on ramelteon and Seroquel for sleep. Her oxybutynin was held given concern that this could be contributing to her mental status changes as well. She refused Seroquel on most nights. Of note, she was continued on her pregabalin, ranitidine, and paroxetine; however, could consider these as possible causes of AMS if she continues to have issues. Over the course of her hospitalization, her mental status gradually improved. She was seen by OT who recommended rehab. She was seen by Neurology who felt her presentation was most consistent with delirium and advised outpatient follow-up in ___ clinic with additional brain imaging as below. . # MRI brain showing: \"Mild thickening and enhancement of the mid to posterior aspect of the falx\" - Neurology evaluated her and ultimately advised outpatient Neurology follow-up with repeat MRI brain as outpatient - Neuro appointment pending at the time of discharge, but ___ team working on setting up an appointment. . # Nephrolithiasis # Recurrent UTIs: While there were no WBCs on UA, given AMS and dtr's report that patient had reported some dysuria, opted to treat as UTI. Urine culture grew e. coli, sensitive to CTX. She was treated for complicated UTI for 7 days given significant delirium. Case was discussed with urology who felt that her remaining stone was unlikely to be nidus of infection. After CTX was completed, she was restarted on her ppx Keflex and this was continued on discharge. . # DOE \/ Cough: Pt reportedly with DOE and cough at home. CXR negative. TTE unremarkable. Pt adamantly denied any respiratory symptoms on the floor. She was continued on her home Advair and albuterol prn, though often refused home Advair, and had no respiratory or exertional complaints while hospitalized.

{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: Mr. ___ is a ___ man with a history of afib on coumadin and alcohol abuse who presented to OSH with upper GI bleed and was transferred to ___ for further management. He was found to have evidence of pancreaticogastric fistula in setting of pancreatic pseudocysts. ACTIVE ISSUES 1. Upper GI bleeding: Underwent EGD on ___, which revealed severe esophagitis and a focal ulcer with large visible vessel in the gastric cardia, s\/p endoclip and injection. Bleeding stabilized and patient was transferred to floor. He had melenic stools initially, likely due to clearing out old blood from his initial bleed. Repeat EGD on ___ showed no evidence of ongoing bleeding. Regarding etiology of his bleeding, CT imaging showed that the lesser curvature ulcer was in continuity with a pancreatic pseudocyst consistent with spontaneous pancreatico-gastric fistula formation. Pancreatic\/biliary surgery was consulted and recommended NPO\/sips for diet with TPN through PICC for pancreatic rest and to reduce the risk of food obstructing the fistula. Patient was maintained on high-dose PPI and TPN and kept off of anticoaulation. He required an additional 1 unit pRBC on ___ for HCT drop. Patient remained stable and CTA was repeated on ___ showing resolution of pseudocyst. Diet was advanced uneventfully and TPN was discontinued. Patient is scheduled for a repeat EGD as an outpatient on ___. He was instructed to hold warfarin until after EGD; pending results, his doctors ___ decide to hold warfarin for a longer period. 2. Pancreatic Mass\/Peudocyst: Spontaneous fistulization with lesser curvature of stomach contributing to bleeding ulcer. Patient had significant weight loss over the past year (40lbs) including about 20lbs over last ___ months in setting of significantly decreased appetite. Consulted with hepatobiliary and pancreatic\/biliary surgery team. Regarding the fistula, pancreaticobiliary recommended no surgical intervention but TPN for pancreatic rest as above. Pseudocyst resolved on repeat imaging on ___. 3. Liver cystic lesions: Incidentally noted large hepatic fluid collection (up to 10 cm) that was possibly continuous with pancreatic pseudocyst. Pancreatic\/Biliary surgery recommended no surgical intervention. Collections improving on ___ CTA. 4. Encephalopathy: Patient was initially encephalopathic with slowed psychomotor responses and confusion. Resolved with his overall clinical and metabolic stabilization. 5. Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis: Etiology was most likely due to acute renal failure. Derangement was primary metabolic acidosis with respiratory compensation. Lactate normal. Level of BUN\/Cr did not suggest uremia. Serum tox screen was negative for EtOH, ASA, and acetaminophen. Osmolal gap -8. Glucose not elevated. No ketones in urine. Resolved. 6. ___: Resolved. Most likely combination of ATN and contrast-induced nephropathy from OSH CT scan, though initial FeUrea also suggested a pre-renal component. Granular casts appreciated on spun urine ___, further supporting ATN. Given this, not likely fluid-responsive and therefore monitored for self-resolution. Did not have any indication for dialysis. 7. Pneumonia: Patient was febrile in ICU with CXR findings concerning for consolidations and ___ CT evidence of multifocal upper lobe pneumonia. Given his chronic alcohol use, recent massive GI bleeding, and encephalopathy, patient was covered broadly with both unasyn and levofloxacin. Unasyn served dual-purpose of covering this pneumonia along with his concurrent Enterococcal UTI. Levofloxacin covered atypicals and Pseudomonas. No significant clinical concern for MRSA pneumonia given multifocality and clinical improvement on his current regimen. Continued Unasyn (___) and levofloxacin (___) for 7-day course 8. UTI: Grew enterococcus, 10k-100k, on ___ and culture negative on ___ after treatment initiated. Completed course of unasyn as above. 9. Lower extremity edema: EF was preserved on ___ bedside ECHO. Became markedly overloaded in setting of volume resuscitation. Low BP limited aggressive diuresis, and patient's regimen was ultimately titrated to furosemide 20 mg PO daily. 10. V-tach: Intermittent, self-limited. Patient was monitored on telemetry and electrolytes were repleted to maintain K>4 and Mg >2. His atenolol was uptitrated to 25 mg BID with improvement in v-tach. 11. Hypotension\/Secondary Adrenal Insufficiency: Patient was persistently and asymptomatically hypotensive. His cortisol stim test suggested mild adrenal insufficiency. He was started on fludrocortisone on ___ and ACTH was sent. ACTH ultimately returned in the normal range several hours prior to discharge, consistent with secondary adrenal insufficiency. Fludrocortisone is generally not beneficial in secondary adrenal insufficiency; however, given that patient was clinically stable, without orthostatic hypotension, he was advised to continue fludrocortisone until his PCP ___. PCP advised to repeat cortisol stim test and consider need for glucocorticoid supplementation (e.g. hydrocortisone) and consider discontinuation of fludrocortisone (predominantly mineralocorticoid). 12. Atrial Fibrillation: CHADS2 score of ___. Patient was persistently in a. fib with intermittent RVR. Rate control was initially held in setting of GI bleed. Diltiazem 30mg po QID was started on ___ and was uptitrated to a total daily dose of 240 mg, though patient missed many doses due to hold parameters (low BP; please see above). Given ongoing RVR that interferred with patient's ability to work with ___, atenolol was restarted and uptitrated to 25 mg daily. Given his high risk of re-bleeding and recent severe upper GI bleed, risk of bleeding on anticoagulation outweighs benefit of small stroke risk reduction, so warfarin was held. Patient instructed not to restart warfarin until after his doctors have ___ ___ EGD and instructed him that it is safe to do so. CHRONIC ISSUES 1. Macrocytic Anemia: Most likely secondary to alcohol use and reported history of B12 deficiency. MCV at baseline is 120. MCV has normalized in the setting of receiving pRBC's and nutritional support. Continued cyanocobalamin. 2. Alcohol Abuse: Patient has a long history of daily vodka use. He showed no signs of alcohol withdrawal, and CIWA scale was discontinued on ___. TRANSITIONAL ISSUES - Repeat labs in 3 days to monitor electrolytes, HCT, and thrombocytopenia. Repeat albumin and cortisol stim test to confirm adrenal insufficiency - Consider stopping fludrocortisone if no evidence of primary adrenal insufficiency (none currently) - If CrCl changes, please consider changing atenolol to a non-renally cleared b-blocker such as metoprolol - Coumadin is on hold. Please consider restarting after ___ EGD - Needs repeat ultrasound of left complex renal cyst in ___ year - During admission, patient had a very high gastrin level, which was most likely in the setting of high-dose PPI. Should there be any concern for gastrinoma in the future, please d\/c PPI and recheck gastrin level. - Lisinopril on hold for low BP - Consider need for ongoing pancreatic enzyme replacement - Needs follow-up imaging for pulmonary nodule seen on CT","summary":"You were admitted on ___ after developing bleeding from your stomach. You underwent an extensive evaluation including physical exams, blood tests, imaging tests, and scoping of your GI tract. Based on these studies, we found that you have a large ulcer in your stomach that was attached to a cyst in your pancreas. You were treated aggressively with units of blood and plasma to improve your blood counts and help reduce bleeding, and the GI doctors also put a clip on the source of bleeding to help it stop. This improved your bleeding and allowed you to stabilize. You received nutrition through your ___ line for several weeks to allow your pancreas to rest. You had a repeat CT scan which no longer showed the abnormal connection between your pancreas and your stomach, and you were restarted on normal food. During your stay, you were also diagnosed with pneumonia and a urinary tract infection. You received a course of antibiotics for both of these and improved. Your kidneys were found to be injured but fortunately after some time improved back to their normal function. During your admission, you were found to have low blood pressures. You had labs suggesting adrenal insufficiency. You were started on a steroid called fludrocortisone while we waited for one of the results to come back. Based on the results we now have available, you most likely have a mild secondary adrenal insufficiency, which can be seen in patients with prolonged illness. Although the fludrocortisone is unlikley helping your condition, we recommend continuing it until you can see your primary care doctor and have your labs repeated."}

{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: Ms. ___ is a ___ woman with a history of CKD4\/5 (on the transplant list), latent TB (on isoniazid), and H. pylori (receiving treatment) who presents with recurrent fevers, myalgias, and diffuse pain, ultimately started on treatment for suspected Still's disease. # Fever, arthralgias, myalgias # Adult Stills Disease Patient underwent extensive work-up for potential infectious or malignant sources of her symptoms (see last section of report). No definite etiology was identified. TB felt to be extremely unlikely since she had no concerning findings and was well into her LTBI treatment course. Did not improve on doxycycline and flagyl (H pylori therapy). Her labs showed evidence of progressively worsening inflammation during the first week of her hospital course. Despite a lack of overwhelming evidence (borderline of meeting criteria), there was a reasonable concern for Still's and so per strong preference of patient and her husband she was ___ on high dose steroids. Her symptoms and many of her lab finding (CK elevation, ferritin, anemia, leukocytosis) improved on therapy. Patient discharged on 60 mg prednisone daily with plan for rheum follow-up. On atovaquone for PCP ppx given hyperkalemia, vitamin D, calcium, PPI. # ___ on CKD stage 5 # Hyperkalemia # Metabolic acidosis # Hyperphosphatemia # Hyponatremia Patient developed ___ during admission with creatinine up to 6, improved to ~4 by discharge. Uncertain etiology of CKD but possibly from NSAIDs or other medications given in ___. She is followed by renal transplant and considering peritoneal dialysis while awaiting transplant. Toward the end of the admission her hyperkalemia worsened, which prompted avoidance of potentially contributing meds, and aggressive bowel regimen. This was successful in improving hyperkalemia, but also worsened acidosis. Bicarb increased, and bowel regimen reduced slightly, which appeared to achieve appropriate balance. BMP checked afternoon of discharge to ensure hyponatremia not worsening, and noted to have bump in creatinine from 3.6 to 4.3. However in discussion with renal, felt this was not contraindication to discharge given low clinical suspicion that this reflected a new acute process but rather a dramatic instance of baseline fluctuation. Patient will have labs 2 days and 5 days post-discharge, which will be sent to Dr. ___. Patient also started on phoslo and her torsemide was continued at 10 mg. Instructed to maintain healthy bowel regimen. #Worsening abdominal pain ___ - suspected fibroid pain #Menstrual bleeding Patient developed worsening abdominal pain on ___, and subsequently developed menstrual bleeding. She stated that this was similar to prior fibroid pain, which had improved 2 months ago with initiation of depoprovera by her gynecologist.

Over the course of hospitalization, patient denied any thoughts of self-harm or suicidal ideation. She continued to have linear and goal oriented thought process. She did not show any obvious signs of psychosis and she maintained all of her ADLs. 2) ETOH ABUSE We also discussed substance use and reported having 2 glasses of wine per week 'socially' despite later stating that she drinks alone at home. Husband gave collateral that was concerning for high quanitity etoh intake. Pt was monitored for withdrawal and showed no signs\/sx of such. Pt was precontemplative regarding sobriety but participated in a SMART recovery meeting while on the psychiatric unit and was interested in continuing this as an outpatient. We recommended she participate in either AA or SMART recovery in a addition to maintaining sobriety. # Goals for discharge and Partial hospital program: Future goals include psychoeducation, medication adherence, psychotherapy, and reducing rehospitalization. These goals will help the patient make a transition back to her home and would allow her to better manage her mood, psychotic, and alcohol craving symtpoms. The goals for partial hospital progam includes psychosocial support, structured environment, access to treaters, psychoeducation, medication compliance, and coping skills. These goals are important because in the absence of this support the patient has worsening psychosis which leads to rehospitalization. # Medical: The patient c\/o of headaches and she refused a CT scan stating that she didn't feel it was medically indicated. She utilized PRN tylenol and ibuprofen that helped alleviate pain. # Social\/Milieu: Patient spent most of the hospitalization on the periphery of the milieu, occasionally interacting and conversing with other patients. Rarely attended groups. # Risk Assessment: While patient has supportive husband and established care providers, patient had a mild decompensation in the community, partially due to poor compliance and substance abuse. Risk was mitigated by administering decanoate antipsychotic, liasing with DMH, PACT team to help at home, ___ services, and the importance of abstinence from alcohol by going to AA and\/or SMART recovery meetings. A repeat decompensation in the community is lower than it has been in her previous admissions since she has been stabilized on decoanate medications. While the patient is likely to deteriorate again, her safety has been good while hospitalized and in the community, and provided she avoids etoh which could lead to disinhibition, she is at low risk for any safety problems in the community. #Prognosis: guarded to fair # Disposition: To home with outpatient follow up.","summary":"You presented after worsening anxiety, increased psychotic thinking, and suicidal ideation.

Differential includes lymphoma, thymoma, thyroid lesion or germ cell tumor. Scattered prominent but nonenlarged mediastinal lymph nodes. - The patient has a 1-cm left lower lobe nodule and 6-mm right lower lobe nodule. Given size, short-term followup is recommended as these lesions are suspicious for metastases. - He also has 1 cm intermediate density lesion in the right interpolar kidney which may represent a cyst or solid lesion. Consider ultrasound to further characterize. - He has a T11 compression fracture. If this continues to bother him, he may benefit from TLSO brace with ambulation.","summary":"You were admitted on ___ with back pain and found to have damage to your heart based on your lab work, despite not having any chest pain.

{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: ASSESSMENT AND PLAN . ___ history of CHF with last EF in ___: 40%, no CAD visible on last cardiac cath in ___, HTN, HLD, current smoker, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation x 2 cardioversion, bad PAD with SFA and B\/L iliac stents, ___ year history of daily opiate use presenting with radiating chest pain, severe htn, atrial fibrillation with LVH and strain pattern. In and out of afib with RVR. Now s\/p cardioversion in NSR on rate and rhythm control with coreg and amiodarone, anticoagulated with pradaxa. . # Chest pain and troponin elevation: Pt described chest pain with radiation to left arm and trop bump to 0.51. Likely NSTEMI but not from CAD. Most likely due to high demand from patient's htn and LVH with afib and rvr causing poor diastolic filling time and wall tension. Pt w\/ risk factors for CAD but ___ cath was clean and EKG changes during hospitalization more suggestive of strain pattern from LVH than ACS. BP was controlled with coreg, lisinopril, and lasix. Pt's initial ___ pressures on admission were in 200s\/100, this decreased to 130s-180s\/80s-90s. Pain resolved with decrease in heart rates and improved BP control and was not present for the past week. In terms of CAD, pt's ___ risk score is >20% for CAD risk equivalent of severe PAD. Pt necessitating aspirin anyway for PAD s\/p stent in ___. At this point, it is unknown what the efficacy is for dabigatran for primary prevention of CAD. Pt should continue with prevention including smoking cessation, lipid lowering and stabalization of plaques with statin therapy, and treatment of hypertension. . # Atrial fibrillation with RVR, SVR, and accelerated junctional rhythm: Pt had atrial fibrillation that was extremely difficult to rate control often sustaining in 140s-160s with pauses lasting up to 5 seconds. When trying to rate control with diltiazem, pt went into accelerated junctional rhythms with retrograde p waves. The patient has been cardioverted twice in past with return of atrial fibrillation. Thus, the patient was started on amiodarone 400 mg BID for prevention of afib recurrence and Pradaxa for anticoagulation. The pt had TEE and underwent successful electrical cardioversion. Notably, the patient reports a transaminitis with previous use of amiodarone; thus, he will need to be closely monitored while on this medication. Pt cannot use Droneardone given his Class II CHF and his CHF exacerbation while in the hospital. Amio isn't an excellent option given pt's baseline lung disease with apical scarring, likely COPD from extensive smoking history, subclinical hypothyroidism history of transaminitis while on the medication, and young age. Pt will need PFTs as pt has not had this before. Cxray and CT scan were performed during this hospitalization; the results of which are as above. Pt remained in NSR after cardioversion. Down the road, if rate\/rhythm control does not ___, it is also possible to perform AVJ ablation with PPM implantation. CHADS score of 2 on dabigatran. After much discussion, dabigatran was chosen as the anticoagulant medication for this patient. He reported being compliant with warfarin in the past, but was annoyed by the fact that he needed such frequent ___ draws. We initially preferred to keep the patient on aspirin with switch to anticoagulant as outpatient when pt showed he was reliable. However, after much discussion with patient and his wife, clear understanding and assurances by patient to adhere to regimen, and pt's request to avoid frequent lab draws, along with risk post cardioversion it was decided that dabigatran would be an acceptable choice for the patient. Also, of note, pt had a very rapid wide complex tachycardia at the time of admission. The most parsimonious explanation would be Afib with aberrancy, but the morphology of the QRS complex was rather atypical for simple aberrant conduction, and there are periods noted on telemetry and ECG where there are wide complex beats which should NOT be aberrantly conducted. It may be that the patient has underlying atrial fibrillation, but has a competing ventricular tachycardia that originates near the left posterior fascicle. An EP study could help differentiate these, but after cardioversion, pt only manifested 3 beat runs of vtach, so no indication for further workup. EP study remains option in future. Such dysrhythmias during the patient's hospitalization made dofetilide a less appealing option. . # Acute on chronic systolic and diastolic CHF: BNP positive. On echo, EF of 40% with severe hypokinesis of the basal half of the inferior and inferolateral walls c\/w prior echo. However, there was worsening of left sided filling pressures. Through hospital stay pt gained 10 pounds with elevation of JVD, increased swelling. This responded well to IV lasix. Pt was placed on lisinopril, Coreg, and lasix. Likely exacerbated by stunned myocardium, htn, rapid ventricular response. Pt was told to restrict fluid intake to diurese back to normal weight. . #SOB: Likely from CHF in combination with baseline lung disease. Pt has extensive smoking history and CXRay revealed flattening of diaphragms suggestive of COPD. Air movement poor but responds well to inhalers. Started spiriva empirically with albuterol prn. CT scan shows apical scarring, I wonder if this could be from his inhaled heroin use. Will need PFTs both for baseline for amiodarone monitoring as well as for characterization of potential obstructive lung disease. . # ___: Creatinine increased from baseline of 0.9 to 1.7 on night s\/p cardioversion. Likely from decreased perfusion. FEurea is<35%. Pt used to be very hypertensive; likely had stunned myocardium post cardioversion, together with some transient relative hypotension during anesthesia causing decreased perfusion in the setting of a kidney that has lost ability to autoregulate ___ to htn. Pt's creatinine trended down and was at 1.1 at discharge. . # Groin pain: Severe but transient for one day. Had workup with ultrasound, hip x ray which was unrevealing. . # Dyslipidemia\/Diabetes screen: HgbA1c=6% indicates prediabetes and lipids with LDL 117, HDL 26; Has CAD risk equivalent of PAD. Outpatient physician can start nicotinic acid for HDL. Notably has strong history of myopathies with statins. LDL should be at 100 given CAD risk equivalent of PAD disease. If statin to be added would try pravastatin as pt has had difficulty with more potent statins. . # HTN: On lisinopril, carvedilol. Still hypertensive to 180s at times. Can uptitrate lisinopril as outpatient. Can also increase coreg to 50mg, as patient tolerated this well while in hospital. Secondary causes investigated in ___ included angiography of the renal arteries which demonstrated no evidence of any flow limiting lesions, negative plasma fractionated metanephrines (very high NPV), elevated urine normetanephrines, no evidence of coarctation, normal serum aldosterone and renin while pt was on Ace-inhibitors. On this admission, htn assumed to be most likely from essential htn. Ddx includes 1) renal artery stenosis--No renal bruits and tolerated ACE inhibitors including high dose captopril very well; 2) pheochromocytoma--evaluated with plamsa and urine fractionated metanephrines (plamsa normetanephrines mildly elevated but very difficult to interpret in setting of opiate withdrawal, afib, stress etc.), 3) adrenal hyperplasia, 4) hyperaldosteronism (Conn's)-- no evidence of electrolyte abnormalities, and 5) aortic coarctation-- not seen on CXRay and no pulse dissociation between upper and lower extremities. PCP can follow up with urine metanephrines at ___. These are likely nondiagnostic given in hospital setting and variety of adrenergic inducing issues ongoing. Would repeat after one months time at PCP's discretion if secondary cause is suspected. To my knowledge, pt's adrenals have never been visualized either. . # Withdrawal: Started on methadone and given diazepam. Last dose of methadone ___ was 10mg. Weaning down diazepam to prn. Will be seen in ___ clinic today. For smoking, given nicotine patches. Discharged with 6 tablets of diazepam for prn use. . # Low Urine pH: Unclear cause: drug vs infection, vs RTA? Pt's bicarbonate is good. Negative for infection. . # Fluctuations in Hgb: Unclear cause; most likely ___ to fluid shifts from hypertension, afib, heart failure, and swings in volume status . # Subclinical hypothyroidism: Elevated TSH, normal free T4. Not treated. Should continue to monitor. . # PVD: Pt with SFA and B\/L iliac stents in ___. Stent intervention has greatly improved his symptoms. Will keep pt on aspirin. Will continue with secondary prevention including smoking cessation, lipid lowering and stabalization of plaques with statin therapy, and treatment of hypertension. . # Pneumonia: On initial admission, there was subjective fevers over 3 days with increased cough in setting of radiographic evidence of possible pneumonia. Pt treated with course of levofloxacin . #CODE: Full #CONTACT: Patient, wife ___ ___ . Transitional: Needs to continuing taking dabigatran. Amiodarone loading now for 10g then 200 mg daily. Need to monitor for amio toxicity given previous hx of transaminitis while on drug, baseline lung disease, subclinical hypothyroidism. Needs baseline PFTs. HTN control can be more aggressive. HDL low, can try nicotinic acid, can try pravastatin or less myopathic statin for goal LDL<100. If pt goes back into afib and cannot be controlled, then consider AVJ ablation with permanent pacer.","summary":"You were admitted for chest pain and were found to be in atrial fibrillation with a very fast heart rate as well as having a very high ___ pressure. Attempts at rate control were ineffective and you had pauses of up to 5 seconds. After much discussion, it was decided to electrically cardiovert you back into sinus rhythm with prevention of future atrial fibrillation with amiodarone. It is imperative that you take your dabigatran (pradaxa) twice a day without fail. This will lower your risk of having a stroke from your paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. You previously suffered liver injury while on amiodarone. You will need to be very closely monitored while on this medication.

{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: ___ yo F with IDDM and ESRD on HD, COPD, PVD who was discharged ___ after a complicated course s\/p AV graft placement with hematoma complication, and ICU stay for hypotension and NSTEMI likely from demand ischemia from acute blood loss anemia, now re-presented from rehab with symptomatic bradycardia observed during hemodialysis. Driving hypothesis is that this was a vaso-vagal event. The patient also had an elevated Troponin, the etiology of which is not known. The hospital course is summarized in brief by problem below: . # Bradycardia: Pt. was bradychardic to ___ at dialysis with complaints of pre-synchope. Common etiologies that were considered included Beta blocerks, CCB's, Amiodarone, Digoxin, increased vagal tone, severe hypoxia, hypothermia and increased intracranial pressure. However, patient is not on any of the above medicaitons. Increased vagal tone seems most reasonable diagnosis of exclusion. There is no record of hypoxia during HD, and she does not semonstrate signs or sympotoms of ICP. We suspect that this was a vaso-vagal bradychardia secondary to her chronic back pain in the context of an uncomfortable procedure. Her bradychardia was not further observed on telemetry, and not pharmacologic intervention was required. . # CAD s\/p recent NSTEMI: currently no CP. Echo on ___ is unchanged from before. Official read as follows: Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 70-80%). The right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. The right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated with depressed free wall contractility. There is abnormal diastolic septal motion\/position consistent with right ventricular volume overload. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is severe mitral annular calcification. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Note, we still do not have a clear reason for her Trop - T of 9+, with subsequent Trops approx flat. CK was initially 146 but trended down. ECG was not concerning for ST segment changes. Simvastatin 80mg was prescribed. Per prior discharge summary, patient was instructed to 1) continue aspirin 325mg for 30 days from start (___) and then lower to 81mg per initial cardiology recs from last discharge summary. 2) continue plavix 75mg daily for at least one year per cardiology recs from last discharge summary and 3) Follow-up with her cardiologist. . . # h\/o HTN: Patient is not on any anti-hypertensives for unclear reasons. She is allergice to ACE-I's. Hydralazine and other IV anti-hypertensives were never required, and blood pressures were well-controolled 118-133 over ___ on the night before discharge. Heart rates were in the ___'s on the night before discharge. . . # ESRD on HD: recently had AV graft to upper left arm (lower left arm graft failed) which was complicated by hematoma and perioperative NSTEMI. Currently graft appears intact. Renal was consulted and recommended that patient resume her T, Th Sa schedule. Patient was instructed that she must return to her ___ clinic tomorrow and resume her regular regimen. Sevelamer, lanthanum, and cinacalcet were continued.

Hyponatremia - Pt was transfered to the ICU with altered mental status per the family members that know her well and nurses in the floor. Her sodium was found to be 115 with serum osm of 244 and calculated osm of 240, urine osm of 457 and sodium of 21. Her TTKG was 2.8. She looked euvolemic on physical exam, but her I\/O balance has been very negative secondarily to poor PO, no IVF and high UOP. She had severe back after her back surgery. Initially it was not clear how much it was dehydration, poor PO intake only taking free water and HCTZ in the post-op setting vs. SIADH, most likely secondarily to pain. Nephrology was consulted who recommended 3% saline. Initially we tried free water restriction and follow up Na, but pt did now improve within ___ hours. PICC was placed and 3% NaCl was started. Her sodium was 120 upon the next lab check, and 3% was stopped. Her pain was controlled (see below). She was then placed on 1500cc free water restriction with minimal improvement. Salt tablets, 2 gm three times daily were started on ___ and her Na improved with this measure and fluid restriction. She should continue on 1500cc fluid restriction daily, and 2 gram salt tabs TID on discharge. Please check electrolytes every other day to ensure that sodium continues to normalize. On discharge, sodium was 129, and should continue to be monitored until it stabilizes above 130 for several days. # Ileus - Patient with constipation noted post-operatively. Had minimal improvement to soap suds enemas. On ___ her abdomen was noted to be markedly distended. Abdominal x-ray revealed very distended colonic loops upwards of 10 cm. She was made NPO, a rectal tube was placed, her narcotics were decreased and she was started on oral narcan for opiod contributions. With further enemas, her abdominal distension improved markedly by ___. She was started on a clear diet and the rectal tube was removed. After resolution of her ileus, the patient was changed back to her home dose of oxycodone, but pain was not well-controlled. Consequently, her pain medications were increased. She should continue bowel regimen with colace, senna and bisacodyl while on narcotics, and bowel movements monitored closely to avoid recurrence of her ileus. . #.

She continued to have a cough and medicine was consulted to evaluate. Thoracentesis was performed and 1.5 liters of exudative fluid was drained (LDH 312, WBC 3100). Pigtail catheter was placed which drained minimal serosangeous fluid. This was thought to be related to the abdominal surgery and resultant inflammation of the LUQ. Her WBC dropped from 20.8 to 14.5 with the thoracentesis. Patient remains feeling well without and is without fevers off all antibiotics. . Pulmonary: Pulmonary toilet including incentive spirometry and early ambulation were encouraged. The patient was stable from a pulmonary standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored.

The dyspnea was thought to be secondary a combination of the effusion and the restrictive effect of the abdominal ascites. O2 remained stable on room air throughout the hospitalization. Given the patient's renal function (discussed below), the team was concerned about the effects of paracentesis on the patients kidneys. Once the patient's creatinine was stabilized and trending towards baseline, a therepeutic paracentesis was done, removing 3L. The patient improved symptomatically. # ARF: The patient was admitted with rising creatinine to 2.1 from his baseline of 1.2. As per the patient, his PO intake had been poor. He was also noted to have a UA indicative of UTI (moderate leuks, moderate bacteria). At that time, it was thought that infection was less likely the cause of his ARF, especially given the patient's stable clinical picture. However, the patient was started on cipro in the ED prior to the sending of urine cultures. Cipro was continued on the floors for presumed UTI.

Per orthopedic surgery, it is normal for patients to lose blood after surgeries, and she was having no other source of blood loss, so this is the likely cause of her acute drop. Patient was not started back on home plavix during hospitalization in the setting of recent bleed. #HTN and tachycardia: Patient initially told the team she was not taking any medications at home. After further investiation, we found that prescriptions were being refilled in her name. On further discussion, it became clear that she was taking these medications, although she had been reluctant to share this information given that she did not have a PCP managing these medications. Home meds were atenolol, hydrochlorothiazide and lisinopril. She appears to have developed rebound tachycardia and hypertension in the setting of these medications being held perioperatively. Prior to learning that she was taking these medications, we started her on amlodipine. Blood pressures only mildly improved over a 1.5 day period on amlodipine, not enough time to see a full effect. Heart rates peaked in 110s-120s, and SBPs 150s-180s. We sent patient for a V\/Q scan to rule out pulmonary embolism in the setting of recent surgery, tachycardia, and t wave inversions in III and flatening in V3 in an EKG showing sinus tachycardia.

He was treated with a short course of prednisone with resolution of his symptoms. He was not treated with colchicine or NSAIDS given renal compromise. He was discharged on his home allopurinol, renally dosed. # dCHF: He was recently discharged from the hospital after a dCHF exacerbation.

During the first day of admission, the patient had 8 electro clinical seizures arising from deep midline with generalization bilaterally. He has given lacosamide 200 mg IV load, and continued on 200mg BID. The second day of admission, the patient continued to have clinical events, but no longer had EEG correlate. As the semiology was very similar, it was felt that these were epileptic seizures with a deep seizure focus that is difficult to capture on EEG. The seizures are characterized by suddenly decreased responsiveness with arm tremor with nonspecific reaching or picking movements in either arm. He is intermittently responsive to simple yes\/no questions and intermittently follows simple commands with delay during the seizures. The event ends with slowly improving mental status, and it is difficult to tell when the seizure ends vs postictal state.

Patient pulled off his EEG leads but clinically improved therefore was kept of EEG monitoring. #Encephalopathy: By ___, he became more encephalopathic and agitated. He had been conversant and appropriate on ___. CT ___ was obtained which was stable. Evaluation for infectious etiology was negative with blood and urine cultures. Patient had a mild leukocytosis on ___ that downtrended thereafter and was not febrile. His mental status change was attributed to multiple AEDs, mild benzodiazepine withdrawal (patient refusing home PO doses), and hospital acquired delirium. Given urgency of radiation planning, patient was given 5mg zyprexa IM BID to help him stay calm during procedures. Home Ativan was converted to IV Ativan (1.5mg q6hours) to avoid benzodiazepine withdrawal, as patient otherwise often refused PO medications. His mental status improved throughout the admission and was able to tolerate PO medications. #Tachycardia: On the day of discharge patient was working with occupational therapy he became tachycardic to 139 with standing and walking.

ACTIVE ISSUES: ============== #Diarrhea Patient presented with 6 months of large amounts of daily watery diarrhea, present during the day and night. Had a history of C. diff in ___, which was treated with PO flagyl. During this hospitalization, C. diff was positive again, and he was started on 125 mg PO vancomycin. He did not have fevers or leukocytosis at this time or during the hospitalization, but did have a markedly low albumin of 1.6. Stool cultures for salmonella, shigella, campylobacter as well as stool ova and parasites unrevealing. After 6 days on vancomycin, patient's symptoms had not improved. Vancomycin was increased to 500 mg PO to treat severe C. diff. GI performed a colonoscopy, which did not demonstrate evidence of colitis. Biopsies were taken at this time and revealed normal colonic mucosa. At the time of discharge, patient was still having frequent soft\/watery diarrhea despite some improvement on the PO Vancomycin. Etiology of diarrhea remains uncertain, as patient's course is atypical for C. diff infection, and current treatment does not appear to be resolving diarrhea. GI recommends MRE vs. CTE in the outpatient setting to further determine etiology. #Recurrent C. Difficile infection (see history above) Switched from PO Metronidazole to Vancomycin Oral Liquid ___ mg PO\/NG QID for 14 day course given this is first line treatment for recurrent C. diff infection. Initially improved though then continued having loose stools. Vancomycin was increased to 500 mg to treat severe C. diff on ___ for a complete 14 day course of the higher dosage.

{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: ___ is a ___ right handed woman with a recent admission to the general neruology service from ___ to ___ ___ognitive decline, tremor and pending uncal herniation on brain imaging. Work up revealed evidence of pachymeningitis of unclear cause and frequent electrographic seizures without clinical correlate. Seizures were controlled with 4 AEDs and an empriric course of systemic steroids provided improvement in the patient's mental status. Over the past month or so the patient has begun to have frequent periods of nodding off and urinary incontinence. There was concern for either medication toxicity or intermittent seizures and she was admitted for repeat imaging of the brain, continuous video EEG monitoring and possible titration of her AEDs. She was found to have a UTI and is completed a course of antibiotics. Her symptoms of incontinence have resolved and her sleepiness is improving. # CHRONIC UNCAL HERNIATION \/ PACHYMENINGITIS: Appears worse on repeat MRI compared with prior. On exam she continues to be alert. She does have some cognitive deficits (can only name 5 words that start with the letter \"s\" in 1 min). The etiology of her uncal herniation could be either secondary to increased intracranial pressure or low CSF pressure in the spine from an occult CSF leak. Fundoscopic exam did not reveal papilledema. The pain service was consulted with a question of empiric blood patch but ultimately the procedure was deemed to risky because an accidental puncture of the dura could be fatal in the setting of increased intracranial pressure. Her workup for an etiology of her pachymeningitis including imaging to look for CSF leak, malignancy workup, and rheumatologic workup was repeated and unrevealing. Concerns regarding her safety at home were raised and a family meeting was held to arrange a safe discharge plan. # SEIZURES: In the setting of chronic pachymeningitis and uncal herniation Ms. ___ has abnormal EEG findings. Although abnormal at baseline, her EEG did not show new abnormalities. She was discharged on Keppra XR ___ daily, phenytoin BID, Zonisamide 400mg qhs. She also continued primidone, folate, and her multivitamin. Her Seroquel was held in the setting of increased sleepiness. # URINARY TRACT INFECTION: UA and urine culture revealed a urinary tract infection and she was treated for an uncomplicated UTI with 3 days of ceftriaxone. Likely this was the etiology of the urinary incontinence and possibly waxing and waning mental status, both of which improved with treatment of her UTI. # PRURUTIS: Ms. ___ has chronic itching with a questionable history of scabies last hospitalization for which she was empirically treated. She had no rash on exam. Dermatology was consulted and felt her itching is not consistent with scabies. It improved with topical creams including Vaseline and sarna. Systemic illness including Hepatitis B and abnormal liver function were ruled out as well. TRANSITIONAL ISSUES - follow up in neurology clinic - elder services is following her outpatient regarding a safe home plan - PET scan outpatient to rule out occult malignancy","summary":"You were admitted to the hospital with increased sleepiness and urinary symptoms. You were found to have a urinary tract infection which was treated with antibiotics. We repeated an MRI of your brain and monitored you on EEG to see if there were any changes to your brain abnormalities. Your MRI has worsened since your last MRI so we repeated a workup to investigate why you have this brain problem."}
{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: ___ year old woman with longstanding Type 1 DM c\/b nephropathy, neuropathy, gastroparesis, and retinopathy admitted for labile blood sugars and ortostatic hypotension. . #. Orthostatic hypotension: Pt found to be orthostatic. Differential: volume depletion from combination of diovan and lasix, autonomic nueropathy, adrenal insuficiency (hypoglycemia, weakness, K+ on the high side of normal, abs eos #=400-500). Pt was given several liters of IVF in the ED and still mildly orthostatic. Adrenal insuficiency was considered in setting of hypoglycemia, muscle weakness, K+ on the high end of normal, mild eosinophilia (abs eos=400-500). Morning cortisol was 3.3 and cosyntropin test bumped cortisol up to 28, 2 hrs later. ACTH still pending. Given the normal results of this cosyntropin test, it is unlikely that pt has primary adrenal insuficiency. However, secondary adrenal insuficiency still possible (although unlikely), pending ACTH results. Autonomic neuropathy was considered in pt with long standing diabetes and end organ involvement. However, EKG did reveal respiratory variation of RR interval making this diagnosis less likely. Additionally, pt not tachycardic, which is often seen in pts with autonomic neuropathy. -Pending ACTH results from ___ and ___ . #. Type 1 Diabetes\/Hypoglycemia: Last hemoglobin a1c 12.8. Patient reports episodes of am hypoglycemia last ___ weeks. Hypoglycemia may be related to adrenal insufficiency. It is also possible that pt has antibodies to insulin (from being exposed to non-purified insulin several decades ago), causing the NPH to stay in her system longer (taking longer to clear), resulting in hypoglycemia. This, combined with recent poor PO intake, likely contributed to her symptoms. Additionally, pt has limited Cr clearance, likely impairing secretion of insulin and subsequently increasing basal rates. It is also possible that pt is not giving herself the accurate amount of insulin since she has poor eye-sight. ___ followed pt during admission. Pt was given NPH 45U in the AM and will continue this regimen at home. (Her home prior regimen was NPH 60U in AM and 20 U in ___ . #. Proximal muscle weakness: Pt reports proximal muscle weakness, however, she is ___ throughout on neuro exam. CK, TSH, LFTs, cortisol syntropin test all wnl. ESR 28 but normal CRP. Pt denies jaw claudication or temporal headaches. Muscle weakness likely ___ hypoglycemia. Pt's insulin regimen was adjusted inhouse. . # Fall: Pt fell on ambulation from the bathroom to her bed. Fall was secondary to poor eye site. Pt fell on her buttocks. Pt had no head trauma, no LOC. She did have some tenderness along ligaments and muscles of spine. Pt told that this was likely musculoskelet and not a fracture, and she was offered an X-ray but pt declined. Pt had full range of motion. Pt was given oxycodone and baclofen for pain and discomfort. . #. UA positive for trace leuks: urine culture negative. . #. HTN: Initialy held lasix and diovan in setting of orthostasis.

An MRI showed a left thalamic infarct which was new in the interim since prior admission, in addition to the known left splenium infarct. This was also not felt to be explaining his symptoms and felt to be an indication of ongoing thrombogenic physiology. Etiology of these recurrent TIAs\/strokes remained unknown. Coumadin was stopped as it was felt to not be of additional utility. Platelet function and clopidogrel test was sent and suggested some degree of clopidogrel resistance. Per agreement with Vascular surgery and Vascular medicine, decision was made to stop the clopidogrel and start a trial of ticagrelor instead. A repeat swallow evaluation was also performed to exclude risk of aspiration in setting of pharyngeal\/laryngeal fibrosis from previous radiation therapy. TEE was attempted at the recommendation of Vascular medicine, however it was unsuccessful due to inability to pass probe through his oropharynx due to fibrosis- no further attempts were made. He was fitted with a Zio patch cardiac monitor in attempt to capture any occult arrhythmia as a source of cardioemboli. Aside from stopping Coumadin and clopidogrel, and starting ticagrelor, no other medication changes were made. His neurologic examination at discharge was at baseline. Transitional issues: [ ] Please continue aspirin and ticagrelor indefinitely for carotid artery stent and secondary stroke prevention.

Required brief ICU stay for AMS ___ hypercarbic respiratory failure and upper airway stridor, s\/p intubation x 30h, subsequently extubated and transferred to the floor. ACTIVE ISSUES ============== # Acute respiratory failure: Patient presented with shortness of breath with diffuse wheezes and was on home O2 at 2L with subjective SOB due to COPD exacerbation. On admission, he had CXR without a consolidative process or fluid accumulation. CTA showed no evidence of PE. On HD #2, patient had episodes of delirium\/AMS with VBG showing hypercarbic respiratory distress and was transferred to the MICU where he was noted to have stridor. He was intubated for airway protection. ENT evaluated the patient and did not observe any abnormalities on scope. He was then started on ceftriaxone for increased sputum production with GNRs in sputum and area of consolidation in the anterior left upper lobe concerning for PNA. The patient then self-extubated after 30 hours and was weaned off down to his home oxygen requirement, so he was transferred out of the ICU to the floor. In the ICU, he received methylpred 60 mg IV q8h from ___ given the stridor and was subsequently weaned on a steroid taper. His treatment was ultimately azithromycin (___), ceftriaxone (___), and prednisone taper starting at 60 mg ___ with 10 mg decrease daily (last dose on ___. He was discharged on this taper as well as Advair to prevent future COPD flares. # Acute encephalopathy: Patient reported by family to have worsening mental status. Appeared in the hospital to correlate with worsening hypercarbia. On ___, he had VBG showing pCO2 to 80's with academia. However, his baseline pCO2 appears to be in high 50\/low 60's. He was intubated (see above) and subsequently extubated. He received a few doses of SL Zydis overnight after transferred to the floor. Etiology for encephalopathy thought to be a combination of ICU delirium, brief course of high-dose steroids, and infection. His mental status was significantly improved on discharge and is anticipated to resolve slowly after discharge. # Acute anemia: Patient with Hgb of 9.5 on admission. Unfortunately this downtrended to mid-7's during his ICU stay. He was noted in the ICU to have melanotic stool, possibly in the setting of high dose steroids. He has a history of GIB in the past. Prior w\/u notable for EGD on ___ that showed 1 cm angioectasia BiCAP electrocautery with excellent hemostasis subsequently.

Her synthroid dose was reduced. It was felt in past that she does better in sinus, but cardiology aggreed that we unlikley would be able to acheive successful cardioversion while she is in hyperthyroid state and we should instead focus on rate control. One concern is that once she flips to NSR, dose of BB is quite high so she was warned about sudden LH or weakness (check pulse). Her INR were borderline so her coumadin dose was slightly increased (2mg 5days a week, 4mg TTh). Her Avapro dose was reduced 300 to 150 to allow titration of metoprolol.

{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: ___ with no known cardiac history who had witnessed cardiac arrest, s\/p resuscitation, with concern for LAD lesion, now transferred from ___ ICU to ___ CCU for cardiac catheterization. 1. S\/p cardiac arrest: It was unclear how long pt was down before compressions started but he was in ventricular fibrillation and after being shocked, he returned to sinus tach within ten minutes. Pt was not cooled because he was responsive and moving around by the time he reached ___. Also, cooling protocol had not been initiated at OSH and by time he reached BI he was out of the window to start cooling. On arrival he was tubed and sedated. Pt was loaded with amio. Over the next ___ hours, weaned off vent and pt responded appropriately. He did not have any other dangerous arrhythmias. Etiology of vfib was most likely secondary to ischemia. EKG and Echo were concerned of mid-LAD lesion. Initially cardiac cath was performed and showed that there appeared to have been a probable LAD territory infarct\/thrombus that spontaneously resolved with medical therapy. EP was consulted and performed EP study, placed single chambe ICD with no complications. A CMR was performed and preliminarily suggested some scaring but final read is still pending at time of discharge. It was rec f\/u with Dr. ___ ___ from cognitive neurology at time of d\/c. He will need repeat echo ___ wks after d\/c. . Cardiomyopathy: Pt was previously healthy and now with depressed LV function with apical hypokinesis. Most likely secondary to ischemia, but concern given coronary arteriogram did not show any direct evidence occlusion. Echo pattern was somewhat consistent with takatsubo's. Pt was started on metoprolol, lisinopril and coumadin (apical akinesis) at time of discharge. He was euvolemic without need for diuresis, so was not started on lasix on discharge. . STE in lateral leads: Post cath, pt had persistent STE in lateral leads and he was asymptomatic. CE were relatively flat with exception of CK (but pt had rhabdo). Concern for coronary vasospasm, so started on diltiazem drip, but this did not resolve to elevations. Pt was re-cathed, but coronaries were clean. Concern that these elevations are secondary to myocarditis. Labs were notable for mildly positive rheumatoid factor, negative varicella and EBV. At time of d\/c ___, viral cx and antimyocardial ab were all pending. Pt was discharged on home dose of asa and started on plavix 75. . H. flu PNA: RML consilidation found post extubation. Sputum cx grew out h. flu and pt has not had prior vaccination. He was treated with azithromycin and ctx. At time of d\/c he had two additional days of ctx so was started on cefpodoxime to finish the abx course. . # Rhabdomyolysis: Thought to be secondary to amiodarone and Atorvastatin. Pt's CKs rose to >11K but kidney function remained normal throughout. He also had mild transaminitis. With aggressive fluid resuscitation, CK's trended down and were wnl by time of d\/c. Kidney fxn remained wnl as well. Pt should avoid atorvastatin and other lipophilic statins in the future. . # Delirium: After pt was extubated, he was persistently delerius with difficulty following commands, signs of anterograde amnesia, and difficulty with word finding. He was also anxious and paranoid, particularly at night. Over course of hospitalization his MS improved but was still mildly impaired at time of d\/c. There is concern for hypoxic brain injury secondary to cardiac arrest. This will need to be worked up as an outpatient and pt\/family were encourage to follow up with cognitive neurologist as above. .

{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: Somnolence: The patient was initially noted be somnolent on presentation. After questioning, the patient noteded taking extra narcotic pain medication and received Xanax in anticipation of pheresis line placement. His somnolence quickly resolved and did ___ recur. Fevers: The patient also presented with fevers with mild non-productive cough and sore throat. The patient had multiple negative blood, urine, and throat cultures. His CXR was clear and his chest CT showed only mild bronchiolitis, consistent with a viral infection. He was initially treated with cefepime, which was broadened to include vancomycin after he continued to have fevers. However, after his ANC recovered to a level above 500, his fevers abated. His IV antibiotics were stopped after 5 days and he was begun on levofloxacin. He was monitored for the next 2 days and was afebrile. He will continue the levofloxacin for an additional 10 days after discharge and possibly longer at the discretion of his primary oncologist. Multiple Myeloma: The patient presented for stem cell collection after cytoxan mobilization. However, he was still neutropenic at that time. His G-CSF was continued at 480mcg BID and eventually his WBC count began to rise after some delay. On the day of discharge, a tunelled pheresis catheter was placed and he had the first of his stem cell collections at the pheresis unit. He will continue this pheresis for a goal of 10x10^6 CD34+ cells\/kg body weight. He will attend daily pheresis sessions until this goal is reached. He will continue on his G-CSF during this time as well. Urinary retention: The patient was bladder scanned given his history of high residual volumes on his previous admission. Again he was noted to have high residual volumes but continued to have normal urine output and normal kidney function. In discussion with urology, this was felt to be a normal effect of his neobladder. He needs higher residual volumes to reach a voiding threshold. The relatively unchanged left kidney hydronephrosis was felt to be a chronic change secondary to his previous ureteral stricture on the left. Back pain: Chronic in nature. Well controlled with oxycontin and oxycodone for break through.

{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: In summary, Mr. ___ is a ___ y\/o M with newly diagnosed AML s\/p \"7+3\" regimen with AraC and Idarubicin now transitioning to supportive care. . # AML \/ BLAST CRISIS: WBC count of 96.9 on admission was concerning for new presentation of acute leukemia. Bone marrow biopsy on admission confirmed the diagnosis of AML with greater than 50% blasts. Emergent leukophoresis was considered but deferred. He was treated with \"7+3\" regimen with cytarabine and idarubicin, which he tolerated moderately. Tumor lysis labs were monitored and he was treated symptomatically. To help his blood counts return to normal, G-CSF was started on a daily basis. . 30 days after the start of induction chemotherapy, a repeat bone marrow biopsy was done. The full results are provided above; findings were most consistent with relapsing leukemia. Peripheral smears in the days that followed showed increasing numbers of blast cells. At time of discharge it is clear that his disease is relapsing. However, after discussion with both Mr. ___, his wife and his daughter, the decision has been made to hold off on more chemotherapy. The risks of more treatment, including prolonged neutropenia, fevers, infection, and longer hospitalization, outweigh the benefits to be had in terms of survival. There have been several family meetings and the course we have agreed upon is for supportive care with transfusions and antibiotics. . # PANCYTOPENIA: He had thromboctopenia with PLT 21 and anemia with HCT 25 on admission. After chemotherapy, he continued to have low counts and was transfused on an almost daily basis with pRBC and PLTs. Etiology of instability was explored (antibody workup, hemolysis workup); however, no clear source was identified. On ___, he developed a fever and SOB while receiving blood and triggered for a transfusion reaction. He now always receives tylenol with his transfusions. However, the workup was negative and it was thought at the time that his underlying fevers (drug vs infxn) and fluid-overloaded status provided a better explanation for his symptoms. . # FEVERS: He developed fevers up to 104. Given his post-chemotherapy neutropenia, he was worked up for infectious causes and covered with broad-spectrum antimicrobials. Lung studies (CXR\/CT) showed findings consistent with pneumonia; however, he did not have significant cough and all of his blood cultures were negative. A urine culture grew VRE and he received a ten-day course of daptomycin. Abdominal CT showed colonic fat stranding and wall thickening indicative of diverticulitis. He was treated with meropenem and this transitioned to a PO regimen of ciprofloxacin and metronidazole. At time of discharge, he has been afebrile for over one week and his diarrhea has resolved. He will continue on PO cipro\/Flagyl in the setting of prolonged neutropenia. . # CHEST PAIN \/ DYSPNEA ON EXERTION: He presented with DOE and he had been complaining of SOB\/chest pain intermittently during his stay in the hospital. His cardiac enzymes remained flat on each occasion and the chest pain resolved on its own. GI causes were also considered, especially since he has been c\/o difficulty swallowing; however, speech and swallow studies did not reveal a clear source of dysphagia\/odynophagia. He was treated with pantoprazole and chest pain resolved. . # VOLUME STATUS: Because of his anemia and thrombocytopenia, he had to be transfused with pRBC and platelets on a daily basis which resulted in severe fluid overload (2+ leg edema, scrotal edema, pulmonary effusions, mild pulmonary edema). He was placed on O2 and nebulizer as needed and aggressive diuresis was started with furosemide 40mg IV TID. Repeat TTE showed no worsening in heart function after chemotherapy with anthracycline. Gradually as his transfusions became less frequent the standing Lasix was stopped. He now gets 20 mg IV lasix when he needs transfusions. At time of discharge he continued to have 2+ pitting edema and he is satting in the mid to high 90's on room air. . # DIARRHEA: He developed severe diarrhea in the setting of neutropenia. C diff was negative multiple times and stool studies were non-revealing. As above, CT abdomen showed colonic wall changes consistent with diverticulitis, and his diarrhea resolved after treatment with meropenem transitioned to levo and Flagyl which he will continue for one week after discharge. . # RENAL FAILURE: Baseline creatinine was unknown at admission. Increased NSAID usage was likely contributing, but also there was likely a prerenal component and possibly some degree of uric acid nephropathy given uric acid of 14.9 on admission. He was treated with continuous IVF with sodium bicarbonate, allopurinol and hydroxyurea. His kidney function normalized and these medications were discontinued prior to discharge.","summary":"You were hospitalized for treatment of acute leukemia. You received chemotherapy but the cancer could not be fully cured. Since you received chemotherapy your blood counts have been low and you have required multiple blood transfusions and will likely continue to require these transfusions. You were also diagnosed with diverticulitis (inflammation of your colon) and are being treated with antibiotics for this. We have added medications to your regimen. These include antibiotics to help treat and prevent infection. To treat the diverticulitis, you will need to take 500 mg of ciprofloxacin twice daily for 7 days and 500 mg of flagyl three times daily for 7 days. You should not consume alcohol while you are on flagyl as this can cause an adverse reaction. You will also need to permenantly take 12.5 mg of metoprolol twice daily."}

The differential considerations include calcified aneurysm versus mesenteric mass. This lesion is not amenable for biopsy. On the CTA Abd\/pelvis, this was again visualized at the branch of the SMA in the mid-abdomen. Per radiology, this was likely due to a thrombosed aneurysm and chronic. Carcinoid is less favored given the absence of small bowel abnormality and jejunal location.

Hepatology was also consulted and was fine with stopping ursodiol and the anti-pruitic regimen recommended by dermatology (fexofenadine, hydroxyzine, petrolatum, and topical steroids). Neurology was also consulted due to initial concern that the rash could be caused by keppra, however, they had a low suspicion that this was the causative agent. # Cholestatic liver failure \/ DRESS: LFTs, Tbili, and synthetic function were monitored and noted to further improve from prior discharge. She was continued on prednisone with plan for slow taper as an outpatient. She will need to be seen by gastroenterology. Due to confusion as to whether she should follow-up with Dr. ___ she had already seen, or a ___ gastroenterologist, this decision was deferred to the patient's PCP. Her PCP may also wish to consider referring the patient to Dr. ___, a local expert in eosinophils and related diseases. # Anemia: The patient was noted to be anemic on presentation (hct 29) and her anemia was stable during her hospital course. She did not receive any blood transfusions. She did have one episode of rectal bleeding following an enema that was felt to be traumatic. This issue will require additional follow-up as an outpatient. # ?Seizure disorder: The patient has no clear history of seizures, only an unrelated syncopal event earlier in the month for which she was seen at an outside hospital, and myclonus in the setting of hepatic encephalopathy during her last hospitalization. Neurology was consulted and they recommended a routine EEG. Based on the lack of seizure activity, they were comfortable with stopping keppra and recommended further outpatient follow-up. # Depression and anxiety: The patient was continued on fluoxetine and seroquel. # Constipation: The patient was placed on a bowel regimen with resolution of her symptoms.","summary":"You were sent to the hospital out of concern that your DRESS had returned. Your liver function is continuing to improve, and you do not have a recurrence of DRESS. Your rash may be a recurrence of eczema and the itchiness related to dry skin, your resolving liver failure, and\/or miliaria. It is also possible that you had an allergic reaction to one of your medications. You were seen by the dermatologists, neurologists, and hepatologists while you were in the hospital. Your EEG showed no evidence of seizure activity and you can stop taking kepra. You may also stop taking omeprazole and urosdiol. After your itchiness improves, you may restart one of these medications if necessary and observe whether your rash returns."}

No PFTs in our system but reports had been done in the past. Not on inhalers at home. The patient was placed on standing duonebs and completed a 5 day course of prednisone 40mg and doxycycline on ___ with improvement of symptoms. Remained afebrile. Discharged home with nebulizer and duonebs with plans follow-up with pulmonology clinic for further management. # Afib with RVR: On admission, the patient was noted to be in Afib with RVR with rates in 150s likely secondary to COPD exacerbation and dehydration. Had a transient episode of hypotension in ED with BP ___ which resolved with IVF bolus; mentating well throughout and no sensation of palpitations. Cardiology consulted and performed bedside TTE that showed normal squeeze and no pleural effusion. The patient was admitted to the CCU for further management. After admission, he developed worsening chest pain with RVR in 140s which did not respond to IVF bolus or diltiazem, and therefore he was loaded with amiodarone gtt and 2 doses of digoxin. Troponins negative and EKG negative for ST changes. He then converted to NSR. He was later transitioned to amiodarone 200mg daily and continued on dabigatran for CHADS2VASc score of 3 (HTN, CHF, PAD).

Troponins negative and EKG remarkable for Afib but no e\/o ST changes. CTA negative for PE. Initially there was concern for pericarditis given positional nature of the chest pain and recent URI symptoms (c\/f viral pericariditis) and the patient was started on colchicine in the CCU. The medication was later discontinued once transferred to the floor as concern for pericarditis was low-- no rub on exam, no PR depression or diffuse ST elevations on ECG and his chest pain resolved. It was likely that the patient's chest pain was due to his underlying COPD and persistent coughing which resolved as his symptoms improved. # Hypertension: The patient has a history of refractory hypertension currently on Amlodipine, lisinopril, carvedilol, and labetolol.

Highest concern was for recurrence of malignancy. The patient underwent a dx and therapeutic thoracentesis of 1600ccs. The fluid was sent for cell count, culture and cytology. The fluid was consistent with an exudate but did not seem infectious in nature (875 WBCs, 81% lymphs, 6% atypical cells; pH 7.44, LDH 107, total protein 4.3, glucose 91). Cytology is pending at this time. Prior to thoracentesis, the patient's oxygen saturation was in the low ___ on room air. After the procedure, she was satting in the mid ___ on RA with ambulation. Her post-procedure chest x-ray did demonstrate persistance of a mild to moderate effusion and the patient was counselled that her symptoms may very well recurr.

This resolved quickly with the administration of 2L NS and may have been provoked by free water intake in a predisposed host who has had intermittent hyponatremia in the past. She was instructed to drink to thirst in the future and not to exceed ___ L of volume intake. Her exam and labs (slightly altered upon arrival, tongue trauma, elevated CK) suggested that she had symptomatic hyponatremia complicated by a seizure. Neurology was consulted and recommended MRI\/A of the patient's brain which was done and was negative for mass or vascular abnormality. After reviewing, the MRI\/A, the neurologists agreed that she likely seized due to acute hyponatremia and recommended against anti-epileptic medications but, rather, just recommended control of sodium levels. In addition, given her elevated CK, she was instructed to hold her statin until further discussion with her PCP. # Back pain. CT from ___ reported several compression deformities. Given above c\/f malignancy, this was relayed to the patient to be followed up on by her PCP. While in house, her motor, sensory and reflex exams were normal and she was treated symptomatically with a lidopatch, valium, oxycodone and tylenol. # Initial report of hematemesis and hemoptysis were further clarified. It seems the patient was coughing up blood tinged sputum and did not, in fact, experience hematemesis. This was clarified after the patient's sodium returned to normal and her mental status cleared. The patient remained full code throughout her hospitalization.","summary":"You were admitted to the hospital for shortness of breath with a low oxygen level and a low sodium level. You were found to have fluid in the space between your lung and your diaphragm. This fluid was drained using a procedure called a thoracentesis.

Patient was admitted to the intensive care unit and placed in cervical traction. After reducing adequately, she was taken to the Operating room on ___ and underwent a ___ Corpectomies and C4-T1 Fusion. This was without complication. She was extubated, removed from traction and transferred back to the ICU. Post operative CT revealed good fusion. A SOMI brace was ordered and she was liberalized to HOB at 45 degrees. The patient was febrile to 102.6 on ___ with a leukocytosis of 17.7. Blood and urine cultures were sent. CXR did not show a definite infiltrate however the patient did have a productive cough. In the setting of elevated WBC, fever and cough she was started on Levofloxacin for PNA. Sputum culture was requested. Lower extremity dopplers were negative for DVT. A speech and swallow eval was ordered given patient's swallowing difficulties and was performed on ___. Unfortunately the patient failed the study and so she was placed on strict NPO diet. On ___ she was taken back to the OR and underwent a C3-T3 fusion. During positioning she was noted to have a sacral decubitis so a wound care consult was called. INR was 1.5 and HCT was 22 so she was transfused with PRBC's and FFP. Post operatively she was not extubated due to laryngeal edema (difficult intubation) therefore ENT was consulted for evaluation. They recommended steroids, PPI and to keep her intubated. She was continued on vanc\/gent for prophylaxsis. On ___ her exam was grossly stable but difficult to examine due to being intubated. CT C-spine revealed moderate retropharyngeal edema but no hardware malfunction or misalignment. On ___ she remained stable, extubation was discussed but she was not doing well on CPAP trial and also did not have a cuff leak. On ___, patient self extubated. She was breathing well on face mask. Strength was full post operatively and her pain was being treated with morphine. On ___, the decadron was being weaned due to delirium and she required the addition of olanzapine. She was febrile to 101 on ___ and she was pancultured. On this day she was reintubated for hypoxia. She required high sedation to prevent self extubation. On ___ the patient was being prepped for the OR with ENT but was noticed in the afternoon to be unresponsive with eyes deviated laterally and out, with flickering of the eye lids. She was given dilantin and ativan and a stat Head CT was performed which was questionable for a right temporal hypodensity. Per neurorad recommendation an MRI was performed. This was negative for stroke or lesion therefore an EEG was ordered to rule out seizure activity. EEG was negative therefore it was discontinued along with the dilatin. On ___ the patient was very lethargic so her sedation was held (> 1 hr) for examination. During this time she self-extubated. O2 sats were stable but she was noted to be aspirating therefore she was reintubated and subsequently trached. On ___ she was neurologically stable and vent was weaned to a trach collar. Her staples were d\/c'd. On ___ patient was transferred to the floor. However, she spiked another low grade temp of 100.8 and was recultured and had an additional chest x-ray. Fever work-up was negative, except for positive pan-sensitive pseudomonas on sputum culture. On ___ Infectious disease consult was called due to patient's leukocytosis and continued fevers. They recommended switching her antibiotics to Cefepime, obtaining a mini-bal, a clostridium difficile culture, and possible ___ guided LP. These studies were found to be negative. On ___ Her INR was found to be trending upwards. Hematology was consulted for their input and recommended Vit. K+. Her PEG was delayed because on her fever and wbc. Nutrition recommendations for TPN was initiated. ENT was also re-contacted for possibility of scoping this pt for eval of possible para-vocal mass that was initially seen on intubation for ACDF. Due to concern surrounding her waxing\/wanning mental status On ___ Her INR returned to normal, her TPN was initiated as per nutrition. ENT did a fiberoptic evaluation and they found poor management of secretions, but no mass and they signed off. She had her LP in INR on this day. Neuromedicine saw her and fel;t that she was in a oculogyrate crisis. Benadryl was given without good effect. She was transfered to medicine due to the complexity of her problems. Her medical floor course can be summarized as follows: ====================================================== INACTIVE TISSUES: ================= #. FEVERS\/LEUKOCYTOSIS: She was inherited on vanco\/cefepime broad spectrum antibiotics without clear source of infection- a pan sensitive psuedomonas was found in the sputum but no radiographic evidence of pneumonia was ever apparent. On ___, her antibiotics were discontinued due to the lack of fevers and a downtrending WBC. A small fluid collection seen on CT along the posterior cervical surgical incision site was sampled via ___, with a bland fluid not suggestive of infection. Urine, blood cultures were negative, as were C dif. On ___, she spiked to 102, she was then restarted on vanco and cefepime. She had pan culture which at the time was all negative. Her only + culture was from sputum the day before with pan-sensitive pseudomonas, although there was no radiologic evidence of infection (pneumonia) this was thought to be causing elevation in WBC- so she was treated with cefepime for a total of 10 days last day was on ___ and she has been afebrile since then. #. DELIRIUM\/ENCEPHALOPATHY: she showed a waxing and waning level of responsiveness. EEG had previously shown only diffuse slowing of encephalopathy, which could have been from her surgical interventions, steroids, zyprexa, infection. There was concern for seizure activity due to contraction of the arms and eye deviation, so an extended EEG was conducted without definite evidence of seizures. Deliriogenic meds avoided. She was then treated for seizures with Keppra and then Dilantin was added since she continue to have seizure activity. Within hours of her dilantin infusion, she developed a severe rash. So this was stopped and she was continued on keppra and started on Lacosamide. She was doing well and then had her last episode of confusion last week in the setting of receiving trazadone for sleep and pain meds. Her sedating meds were held and pt has been doing much better. Now A+O x 3. She was restarted on oxycodone for pain and I would consider restarting Ambien once pt is stable on her new location. There were multiple head images which did not show anatomical cause of her confusion or seizures #. OCULOGYRIC CRISIS: she had a dystonic reaction from zyprexa with an unclosable mouth and eye deviation. This lysed with IV benadryl on ___. She had similar symptoms on ___ which again responded to IV benadryl. Anti-psychotics were avoided. ACTIVE ISSUES: =============== # Seizures: Has been having unusual EEG activity and three confirmed seizures since ___, most recently on ___. She was loaded on Keppra on ___. Loaded with dilantin on ___ but experienced a drug rash. She then had recurrence of witnessed sz over the weekend on ___ that lasted 3 min with lip smacking, arm movement and blinking. No other event since then. Spoke to neurology who recommended increasing dose of Lacosamide from 200-> 300 mg on ___. We still uncertain what is causing the sz activity, multiple head images did not show anatomical causes. Possible encephalalitis r\/t medications. However, pt has remained stable. Neuro is okay with us restarting pt on neurontin for neuropathic pain, so this was done on ___ and dose was increased to BID. - Continue ___ Keppra 1500mg BID and Lacosamide 300mg BID - Started on neurontin 300mg ___ on ___ for neuropathic pain which can increase to BID today if tolerating well and may increase to TID - Neurology will be calling your facility to schedule a follow-up appointment within 2 weeks. # s\/p Tracheostomy: Patient was complaining of sore throat and discomfort. No change in oxygen saturations. Dr. ___, ___ surgeon, did not feel she was amenable to a trach revision to a smaller trach. Recommended ENT evaluation for increased secretions, failed speech and swallow, apparent difficulty with the trach. ENT saw pt on ___t bedside and findings are consistent with weakened muscles and aspiration, so no intervention at this time, except for cont with trach care, humidified oxygen and speech therapy. She also had video swallow on ___ that showed aspiration. So for now pt should cont to be NPO. - Continue supplemental oxygen via trach mask - Trach care - Cont to work with speech therapy - Pt able to clear secreations and to use passmier valve . # s\/p cervical fusion\/Anterolisthesis: she was taken to the operating room on ___ and underwent a ___ Corpectomies and C4-T1 Fusion. This was without complication, but as noted above she had multiple complications. Anterolisthesis (anterior dislocation of her spinous process) was found to have worsened on the most recent MRI c-spine. SOMI cervical brace was placed per Neurosurgery and should be on at all times. The brace was just adjusted yesterday and is fitting more comfortable by patient. She has small pressure ulcer on her chin that is healing and on the back of her head that is also healing. Neurosurgery will be following the patient and she has appointment on ___. She will have a repeat CT scan at that time. - Per neurosurgery: Patient must be lying flat if she is in an aspen collar, otherwise she must be put in a full neck brace at all times (would prefer not changing from SOMI brace to Collar since concern for dislocation). # Pain: pt with pain at her surgical site and due to position related to brace. She has also chronic neuropathic pain and has been on neurontin and multiple meds prior to her admission. She asked to have neurotin restarted.

During this hospitalization, the blockage in your coronary arteries that were causing your symptoms was opened during a procedure called a cardiac catheterization. During this procedure, a device called a stent was placed in the blocked artery to open the artery, restore blood flow through the artery and, in turn, restore oxygen supply to your heart muscle. This procedure should help to improve your symptoms and prevent future heart attacks. The catheterization, however, is only one part of your treatment; the other part of your treatment is your new medication regimen."}

ACUTE\/ACTIVE PROBLEMS: # Acute blood loss anemia # GI Bleeding Has a history of baseline anemia that is thought to be a combination of iron deficiency and chronic inflammation. Based on history, suggestive of upper source (also BUN\/Cr ratio quite high), possible ulcer, especially in light of chronic prednisone use. However, the patient was adamant that she did not want an EGD or colonoscopy. This was discussed with her family as well. She understood the risks of forgoing endoscopy. She felt like she was too old and did not want any interventions. She continued to have melena throughout her hospital stay, but her H\/H stabilized. She received a total of 3 units pRBCs and 1 unit of platelets during this hospital stay. Her most recent blood transfusion was on ___ and from then until discharge on ___, her H\/H remained stable and she was hemodynamically stable. Her warfarin was held on discharge until she can follow up with her PCP. This was discussed with the patient and she understood that there is a risk of stroke off warfarin. # ___ Baseline Cr ~1.4-1.5, presented with 2.0. Most likely this was pre-renal from bleeding and concurrent diuresis. Her Cr returned to baseline (1.4) by the time of discharge. Her torsemide was initially held, then resumed at half her home dose until she can follow up with her PCP. # Hypernatremia Likely from volume depletion and from diuresis. This improved with increased PO intake. # R ankle pain # Severe RA She had no swelling or erythema and per patient no recent trauma. Ankle XR showed no fracture or dislocation. ESR is up from ___ but CRP is down. This was consistent with her prior RA flares. She was continued on her home dose of prednisone 5 mg daily. Her methotrexate was held. She was also given acetaminophen and a lidocaine patch. The lidocaine patch significantly relieved her pain. CHRONIC\/STABLE PROBLEMS: # CAD # LV Aneurysm # Chronic Systolic Heart Failure # Severe Aortic Stenosis LV aneurysm and history of strokes make the therapeutic decision of ongoing anticoagulation along with unresolved etiology of GI bleeding challenging. As discussed above, her warfarin was held on discharge due to ongoing melena with stable H\/H. Unclear why patient is not on aspirin. She appeared euvolemic on exam despite holding torsemide for most of her hospital stay. Her home atorvastatin, metoprolol, and lisinopril were continued. # History of DVT - pneumoboots used in the hospital Ms. ___ is clinically stable for discharge. The total time spent today on discharge planning, counseling and coordination of care was greater than 30 minutes.","summary":"You were admitted to the hospital for anemia (low blood counts) and black stool (melena) due to GI bleeding. We discussed doing an endoscopy or colonoscopy but you did not want to do any procedures. Instead, we gave you blood transfusions and monitored you for further bleeding.

{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: ___ M with hypothyroidism, hypercholesterolemia, vertigo who presents to ED with altered mental status 3 days after a fall on the ice with residual left shoulder pain. # Altered mental status. Patient has underlying dementia at baseline per prior OMR records, but per daughter the current symptoms are acute. Patient was alert and oriented at time of initial exam, but speech was very tangential\/rambling. The patient's mental status waxed and waned over the course of this admission. Given recent fall, there is concern for possible late subdural bleed, although head CT negative. Patient's UA was suggestive of possible UTI (culture ultimately grew E. coli), and per nursing urine was foul-smelling. Infection could also cause acute delirium. Pain in arm from fall could also contribute. Finally, patient reports recent frequent vomiting and may have become dehydrated - this could also contribute to delirium. The patient received IVF to correct dehydration. Tramadol was stopped. Acetaminophen was started to control any pain from his fall. Telemetry and Foley were ultimately discontinued to minimize lines. The patient was re-oriented as needed. UTI was treated with antibiotics. The patient's mental status improved, although not quite to his baseline per daughters. The patient and his family were cautioned that the delirium may come and go over the next few days to weeks. The patient was asked not to drive until after his follow up appointment with his PCP. # UTI. UA was positive on admission. Patient self-catheterizes at home three times daily given BPH. This is likely to introduce organisms into the bladder, and long periods of urine stasis likewise will promote infection. Prior cultures in our system have grown coag-positive staph and enterococcus. Patient received ceftriaxone until cultures returned positive for pan-sensitive E. coli on the day of discharge; he was then converted to ciprofloxacin to complete a 10-day course for complicated UTI. # Recent fall. Per patient, this was a mechanical event - states he slipped on ice which he mistook for a puddle. He landed on his left elbow but feels most pain in his left shoulder. No visible markings on elbow which patient states is because he was wearing a heavy overcoat. No acute changes on plain film from ___. He was observed to use his arm minimally, although passive range of motion was intact. Additional plain films of the humerus were obtained which showed no fracture. He was seen by occupational and physical therapy services, who recommend initial home OT followed by outpatient ___ until recovered. He was placed on standing acetaminophen 500 mg QID while in-patient to minimize pain (although patient had few complaints at rest) as well as contribution of pain to altered mental status. Tramadol was discontinued. # Vomiting. Per patient, has vomited several times over past few days in response to eating. He attributes N\/V to the tramadol which also causes a \"bitter taste.\" Gastroenteritis also a possibility. No N\/V during this admission. The patient received IVF as above to correct any dehydration. Tramadol was held as above. # Vertigo. Patient reports vertigo symptoms (\"the room is spinning\") earlier on the day of admission. Has symptoms on and off at baseline. During this admission, patient's symptoms were mild. Continued on meclizine. # Urinary retention. Secondary to BPH. ___ was placed initially, but prior to discharge ___ was removed and patient was allowed to straight cath himself. He was able to do so successfully (not limited by pain in his left arm\/shoulder), but the nurse noted that patient's clean technique could use improvement. # Hypercholesterolemia. Continued on simvastatin. # Insomnia. Continued on oxazepam as the patient reported he takes this medication nightly. If delirium persists, would consider weaning off as an outpatient. # Anemia.

{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: ___ SUMMARY: ===================== Ms. ___ is a ___ with history of dementia, recurrent falls, cervical spondylosis, seizure disorder on keppra, HF with borderline EF, CKD III, T2DM, HTN, and dyslipidemia who presents after a near fall at home, evaluated by neurology in the ED who did not feel that patient had a seizure, more etiology thought to be more likely neurocardiogenic syncope. On further eval, most likely cause of presyncopal episode was dehydration in the setting of bradycardia on a beta blocker. Patient was also found to have ___ on admission, with further workup revealing R kidney hydronephrosis not amenable to intervention. TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: =================== [ ] Patient will need close monitoring of renal function by PCP ___ 1 week of discharge, along with post-hospitalization follow up. [ ] Her Keppra was dose-adjusted given her persistent ___. If her ___ improves or worsens, this will need to be dose-adjusted again. [ ] If worsening renal function on next ___ check, will need urgent referral to ___ in ___ clinic to discuss long term management of UPJ obstruction. Please call ___. [ ] Metoprolol was held given bradycardia during hospitalization. [ ] Glipizide was held given well-controlled A1c during hospitalization and risk of hypoglycemia. [ ] Patient is on aspirin- this medication was held during hospitalization and should not be restarted until discussion with PCP. [ ] Lisinopril was held in the setting ___ during hospitalization. [ ] Follow up with neurologist Dr. ___ concern for seizures precipitating falls\/syncopal episodes [ ] Continue wearing compression stockings to improve possible orthostatic hypotension. [ ] follow up with GI or surgery as an outpatient given chronic, recurrent volvulus. Communicated recommendation to PCP who can refer as needed ACUTE\/ACTIVE ISSUES ================== # Acute kidney injury Baseline Cr 0.7-1.1, elevated to 1.8 in ED. Initially thought prerenal iso poor PO, but did not improve with fluids. Given possible falls recently, rhabdomyolysis was considered, but CK was normal. SPEP was normal. There was also concern for possible intrinsic renal injury such as ATN given elevated urine Na, but no casts were seen on U\/A. Patient had renal ultrasound on ___ which showed grade 4 severe hydronephrosis of the R kidney and hypotrophic L kidney. Patient had no signs of pyelonephritis or infection at the time. Patient underwent CT abdomen\/pelvis without contrast, with no obstructing stone seen, but did show acute on chronic large sigmoid volvulus with large bowel obstruction likely causing moderate-severe R hydronephrosis by mass effect. It is unclear if the hydronephrosis is acute or chronic, and whether volvulus is related. ___ likely in setting of unilateral hydronephrosis with hypotrophic L kidney. Urology and renal were consulted and patient underwent renal nuclear study on ___ to evaluate for UPJ obstruction and determine if renal function was preserved. Scan showed partial obstruction at the R UPJ, with decreased bilateral blood flow but essentially normal L renal function. Given partial renal function and discussion with patient's healthcare proxy of the patient's goals of care in the setting of her comorbidities and baseline dementia, urology team recommended attempting non-operative treatment at this time as long as renal function remains relatively stable. Patient will need renal function monitored closely by her PCP given no plans for inpatient intervention at this time. If renal function worsens in outpatient setting, patient should be urgently referred to ___ in ___ ___ clinic to discuss long term management of UPJ obstruction. Patient's home lisinopril was held iso ___. Discharge Creatinine of 2.1. # Chronic large sigmoid volvulus, not actively obstructed Patient has history of large bowel obstruction presenting with subtle symptoms and is also s\/p colectomy. Given history and concern that patient unable to verbalize symptoms ___ baseline dementia, patient underwent abdominal X-ray on ___ which showed nonspecific non obstructive bowel gas pattern. Given R kidney hydronephrosis (as detailed above) obtained CT A\/P without contrast that showed acute on chronic large sigmoid volvulus with large bowel obstruction likely causing moderate-severe R hydronephrosis by mass effect. Reassuring as it is acute on chronic, imaging read as decreased compared to ___, and patient hemodynamically stable. ACS was consulted and was not concerned for clinical obstruction, therefore recommend outpatient follow up and no need for emergent or urgent surgical intervention. GI was consulted and did not feel there is a role for colonoscopy at this point and thought that the patient needs eventual, non-urgent surgical intervention. Serial abdominal exams were monitored and reassuring. #Unresponsive episode Patient found to be unresponsive on ___ AM and was hypotensive to 70\/48, last seen normal 20 minutes prior. FSBG 142. Patient was bolused IV fluids and SBP improved to 130s. After BP improved, her mental status returned to baseline. Neuro exam at this time was unremarkable, as was abdomen, cardiovascular and respiratory exams. EKG revealed mild sinus bradycardia, unchanged from prior. VBG notable for elevated CO2 but likely in setting decreased respiration during episode. CT head WO contrast was without acute findings. 24-hour EEG was reassuring against seizure activity. Hypotension could be related to NPO status and initiation of low dose amlodipine, although would not expect such a quick response to anti-hypertensive. On review of previous notes and in talking to niece, patient does have history of possible orthostasis as well as autonomic dysfunction, and niece notes several of these similar unresponsive episodes at home over the past few months. Orthostatic vital signs were positive but did not correct with fluid resuscitation and therefore think patient may have some underlying autonomic instability leading to these episodes. Also concern for possible non-convulsive seizure vs post-ictal state (which could also lead to autonomic dysfunction) given patient has history of seizures. Patient did not have any incontinence or tongue biting. Obtained 24hour EEG which was unremarkable. Of note, her Keppra was dose-adjusted given her persistent ___ and this will need to be monitored as an outpatient. Patient has scheduled follow up with neurologist. # Near fall at home, concern for presyncope # History of vasovagal syncope Patient presents after a third episode of presyncope. Likely etiology is combination of dehydration in patient with bradycardia on beta blocker. Neurology was consulted in ED and mentioned a well-documented h\/o vasovagal\/neurocardio syncope but unclear where this has been documented. Despite seizure hx, neuro not concerned for seizure as etiology (previous seizures have occurred iso acute illness eg volvulus\/infection). Unlikely infection given no leukocytosis, afebrile, negative U\/A. Orthostatics in ED were reportedly negative. Patient not hypoglycemic on admission, although patient is on a sulfonylurea so higher risk of low sugars. Patient noted bradycardic with HR in ___ on metoprolol, so may have contributed to presentation. No PR prolongation or e\/o heart block on EKG. Last TTE was ___, had LVEF 30%. Troponin negative. Also was some concern for hypothyroidism given patient always turns AC off per niece, but TSH normal. No chest pain or hypoxia to suspect PE. Patient at baseline mental status per niece. Patient was monitored on telemetry during stay. TTE was not repeated because thought unlikely to be high yield given no murmur on exam. Patient's home metoprolol was held as below. # Bradycardia - NSR in ___, concern for possible symptomatic bradycardia as above. No PR prolongation or e\/o heart block on EKG. Trop negative, TSH normal. Patient was monitored on tele. Home metoprolol was held as patient was likely symptomatic from bradycardia. Plan to hold on discharge for patient to discuss with PCP. HR has been stable in 50-60s. # Hypertension Patient hypertensive to 220\/90 upon arrival to the floor, has intermittently been so throughout prior admissions. Likely not acute, will plan to only lower by ~20% to SBPs 160-170s. IV hydralazine 10 x1 with subsequent drop to 90\/50s. Patient's goal BP while inpatient was 160-170s\/90s. Home lisinopril 40mg qd was held iso ___. As per above, she was briefly trialed on Amlodipine 5mg but the patient became subsequently hypotensive - as such, this was discontinued. If remains hypertensive at PCP follow up, consider reinitiation of an anti-hypertensive. CHRONIC ISSUES: =============== # Normocytic anemia: Hb 9.2 on admission, at prior baseline. No evidence of bleeding. CBC was trended daily and an active T&S was maintained. # Dementia: At baseline per niece. Patient oriented only to self. Answers 'okay' to most questions in ___ and ___.

Neuro consulted, not concerned for seizure on presentation. Had an EEG which was reassuring. # Chronic, intermittent diarrhea: Symptoms are unchanged as per patient's niece. Continued home loperamide prn # T2DM: Last A1c 7.7% ___. On glipizide at home. Repeat A1c on admission was 7.5. Held glipizide while inpatient and also considering discontinuing medication given risk of hypoglycemia.

He was evaluated by psychiatry, who did not feel as though he was a suicide risk on this admission. # S\/P assault, throat and back pain: He reported improvement in his left upper extremity strength, which he had initially noted to be decreased after the assault. MRI of the C-spine and T-spine did not demonstrate any evidence of cord compression or other structural abnormality to account for these symptoms. Additionally, he reported persistent change in his voice and difficulty swallowing liquids after being attacked and struck on his neck. The patient was not noted by staff to be aspirating liquids or solids during his stay. The patient remained concerned over the presence of a lumbar vertebral fracture. We offered to evaluate the lumbar spine with plain films, given his history of chronic low back pain exacerbated in the setting of recent assault, but he declined as he felt the team would not change their opinions. Of note, he became agitated and aggressive towards staff when we refused to provide a prescription for narcotic pain medication upon discharge. # Drug seeking behavior This decision to attempt to avoid narcotic medications was aided by discussion with his PCP (Dr. ___ at ___ ___) who reported that he had previously sought out additional narcotic pain medications following the amputation of his toe on the right foot (___). She reports that he untruthfully claimed to have not been given any pain medication upon discharge following this surgery in ___, and so she prescribed a small number of narcotic pain pills. She later received a call from his pharmacy, stating that he had in fact received narcotics from his surgeon, and had attempted to fill her prescription as well.

Active Issues: (1)Abdominal Pain, nausea\/vomiting: Etiology of her gastrointestinal symptoms remained unclear and resolved without dedicated intervention, but perhaps reflected some component of adrenal insufficiency as below; frank adrenal crisis was felt to be unlikely in the absence of electrolyte abnormalities or hemodynamic instability. Despite constipation, there was little suspicion for obstruction, given continued flatus and nontympanitic abdomen. In the setting of self-reported history of ischemic colitis and later C. difficile infection, recurrent ischemic colitis was felt to be similarly unlikely in the absence of postprandial pain or hematochezia while absence of diarrhea essentially precluded C. difficile colitis. Lipase and urinalysis were unremarkable on admisssion. Gastrointestinal symptoms had largely resolved and she was tolerating oral intake by the time of discharge. (2)Addison's disease: Cosyntropin stimulation test performed after home steroid regimen was held for approximately 24 hours was consistent with adrenal insufficiency, possibly iatrogenic; her phenotype was felt by the endocrine service to be inconsistent with Addison's disease in the absence of skin changes, suppression of axillary hair growth, or objective weakness. She declined further evaluation, including pituitary MRI, in-house and was discharged on her home glucocorticoid\/mineralocorticoid replacement regimen.

Despite reported history of QT prolongation, QTc remained 410s-450s on multiple EKGs over the course of admission, and electrolytes were repleted as needed. Cardiac event monitor may be considered in the outpatient setting. (4)Syncope: She experienced no recurrent syncopal episodes in-house without evidence of arrhythmia or other clear abnormalities on multiple EKGs. There were no events, with the exception of intermittent asymptomatic sinus bradycardia, on telemetry, and recent outside hospital electroencephalogram was negative for seizure activity. Although there was no orthostatic hypotension, she did display postural tachycardia and may benefit from autonomics evaluation in the outpatient setting. (5)Leukocytosis: Leukocytosis to 13.4-14.2 was likely due to demargination following stress-dose hydrocortisone. She remained afebrile and hemodynamically stable without localizing signs\/symptoms clearly attributable to infection, and leukocytosis resolved without dedicated intervention by the time of discharge.

She is no longer an active smoker, she is UTD on her cancer screening and has not presented with an obvious hypercoagulability thus far in her life. As her renal function improved, we decied to go with lovenox bridge to coumadin. . Plan going forward: - Patient to follow-up with PCP to establish ___ in a ___ clinic . Tachycardia: Patient was newly tachycardic for the first time on the day of discharge. She was euvolemic and her bp was up to 130\/70, and her HCT was stable making hypovolemia unlikely. Instead we believed that now that when her renal function improved she cleared her atenolol and began responding appropriately to her PE. - We started metoprolol at 25 BID with reduction in her heart rate. She should be switched to 50mg Metoprolol ER QD tomorrow morning. . Plan going forward: - would have patient discuss changing atenolol to metoprolol SR given her renal faillure. .

{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: ___ y\/o female with a past medical history of Aflutter, orthostatic hypotension currently on midodrine, h\/o falls, DMII, PMR on prednisone who presented s\/p fall and was found to have a right flank hematoma, transferred for medicine for management of fall, orthostatic hypotension and acute blood loss anemia. #Fall, orthostatic hypotension: Patient has a history of orthostatic hypotension, numerous falls, and suffered a fall on ___ at her living facility. She described losing her step upon getting out of bed, and had symptoms of lightheadedness at the time. She denied any loss of consciousness. For her orthostatic hypotension, patient at baseline is on midodrine. It is possible that ___ midodrine in combination with her beta blocker and lisinopril is contributing to her orthostatic hypotension. Patient is on chronic pred 5mg for PMR and there was initially a concern for possible adrenal insufficiency but this was ruled out (see below for more information). Patient also has peripheral neuropathy, and poor ambulatory function at baseline, both of which causes her gait to be unsteady as well. Patient denied any prior history of sudden LOC to suggest cardiac etiology. She also denied any palpitations or chest symptoms. She was monitored on tele without any notable cardiac events. Patient has a history of AF but remained in SR while she was hospitalized. There was no physical exam findings to suggest aortic stenosis. Hence, overall there is a low suspicion for structural heart disease. She denied any prior seizure history and was not post-ictal after her fall. ___ BP was in 120s-140s\/60s-70s prior to discharge and she was not orthostatic. All together, we believe patient suffered a fall in the setting of being on midodrine, and antihypertensives (lisinopril, metoprolol), in combination with poor balance\/peripheral neuropathy at baseline. Patient was continued on home midodrine on discharge, and after a discussion with her PCP, ___ lisinopril was discontinued and metoprolol decreased to 25mg XL daily. Patient will follow-up with PCP to determine whether she should have any other adjustments to her medication doses. #R\/o adrenal insufficiency: Patient is on chronic pred 5mg for PMR, and in the process of working up for her fall, an AM cortisol returned at 1.1. This was likely artifact. We obtained a repeat cortisol, which returned as 15 and is more consistent with prior cortisol levels in our system. This repeat cortisol level was also drawn at a more appropriate time of the day. Given that patient did not have any orthostasis, without sodium or glucose abnormalities, and absence of other adrenal insufficiency symptoms, this level is likely a laboratory error. Patient was able to ambulate without any dizziness or other symptoms. This questionable cortisol result was communicated with outpatient PCP via phone call, who agreed that it is likely a non-issue. We continued patient back on home prednisone for her PMR upon discharge. #Acute blood loss anemia: Patient developed acute blood loss anemia in the setting of her fall and developing a large R flank hematoma. Hgb on discharge was 7.6 (baseline ___. She did not have any active evidence of bleeding on discharge, and her CT did not show any active extravasation. Patient will follow-up with her PCP, and should have her CBC repeated as an outpatient. #R flank\/extrathoracic hematoma: Patient suffered a fall and developed a large R flank hematoma. A CT scan showed the flank\/extrathoracic hematoma was 18 x 12 x 4.3cm without any evidence of active extravasation. This was progressively resolving and improved at the time discharge. #L radial fracture, R midshaft clavicle fracture: Patient with fractures from prior fall in ___ and is s\/p by ortho. Per ortho, ___ fractures are healing well and is best managed non-operatively. Per ortho, patient can be WBAT for LUE and RUE. She will follow-up in outpatient orthopedics clinic. #PMR: ___ PMR was stable during this inpatient hospitalization. We continued ___ home prednisone on discharge. #DMII: Patient was treated with ISS while inpatient with sugar levels remaining largely at goal. She was resumed on her outpatient DM regimen upon discharge. #GERD: We continued patient on home omeprazole. =============================================================== Transitional Issues: 1. Please follow-up on ___ orthostatic hypotension. After discussing with her primary care physician, ___ discontinued her lisinopril, decreased her metoprolol to 25mg XL daily and continued her home midodrine. 2. Please follow-up on her acute blood loss anemia and repeat CBC during primary care appointment. Hgb on discharge was 7.6. 3. Please follow-up regarding her ACTH level (pending on discharge). Note that this was sent due to low cortisol (1.1), but the 1.1 was likely a lab error as the repeat cortisol level was 15. 4. Please follow-up regarding the healing of her L radial and R clavicle fractures. # CODE: Full Code # CONTACT: Daughter, ___ ___","summary":"You were admitted to the hospital after you suffered a fall at home. We evaluated you in the hospital and found that you had a big bruise on your right side. We believe this was likely due to your blood pressure being too low when you stand up. We stopped your lisinopril to help keep your blood pressure up, and it was in a good range while you were here. We also decreased your metoprolol from 50mg to 25 mg."}

ACUTE\/ACTIVE PROBLEMS: #Warm Auto-immune Hemolytic anemia Low haptoglobin. Coombs positive (IgG+). Spherocytes on peripheral smear. Unclear whether there is a precipitating cause, though it is suspicious that it is occurring in the setting of so many other lab abnormalities (as below). Now stablizlied around hemoglobin of 9. Hematology initially considered prednisone but deferred ultimately given stabilization. Hematology will reach out to patient to setup outpatient follow-up appointment. Torsemide was held on admission which has a sulfa-moiety.

MRI of the spine demonstrated multi-level degenerative disc disease associated with severe canal and foraminal stenosis in the lumbar spine. Serum studies have been notable for hematological abnormalities, elevated inflammatory markers, and elevated CK and LFTs that are tending toward normal. The degenerative changes in the lumbosacral spine could certainly be playing a prominent role in the lower extremity weakness. The quickly and spontaneously normalizing CKs (even while on a statin) seem to point away from a primary muscle process (e.g. inclusion body myositis). NEUROLOGY RECOMMENDATIONS: - follow clinically - nerve conduction studies\/electromyography could be helpful, and may be done on an outpatient basis (will be arranged by neurology) - obtain bilateral ankle-foot orthotics - fall precautions - rehab - Neurosurgery consulted recommended lumbar decompression previously recommended at ___, is quite certain he does not want surgical intervention at this time.

{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: ___ year old man with a likely diagnosis of Crohn's s\/p subtotal colectomy with pouch, history of pouchitis, with recent anal fistula repair in ___ at ___ who presents with three weeks of joint pain. # Inflammatory bowel disease, possibly Crohn's: On admission, the patient was noted to have elevated CRP\/ESR, as well as findings on physical exam consistent with enthesitis. He did not note any findings of a GI flare of Crohn's, such as increasing frequency of stool, abdominal pain, or increased blood in the stool. The first two days of his hospitalization he required high doses of IV dilaudid for pain control, but upon discharge had only occasionally required PO oxycodone for pain control. Upon review of the medical records from both ___ ___ (where his colectomy was originally performed) as well as Pathology reports from ___, there appeared to be pathologic findings such as transmural inflammation and wall thickening, perforation and pseudopolyp formation on biopsy. In addition, the patient's recent anal fistula repair also suggests transmural inflammation leading to fistula formation, more consistent with Crohn's disease, although he presents with a diagnosis of ulcerative colitis. Based on this belief that the patient has Crohn's disease, the GI team recommended started Sulfasalzine 1000 mg BID, with a plan for the outpatient initiation of Remicade therapy. The patient was prepped for possible Remicade therapy with PPD placement, and the drawing of Hepatitis serologies (which are still pending). The patient indicated that he wished to be followed by Dr. ___ at ___, and has an appointment with Dr. ___ on ___ attempts were made to make this appointment earlier. A CXR performed to rule out TB did not show any evidence of TB. A CT of the abdomen and pelvis to rule out infection prior to the start of anti-TNFalpha therapy only showed post-surgical changes from subtotal colectomy with no findings of intra-abdominal abscess or overt findings of active Crohn's disease. There was some thickening along the ileocolonic anastomosis and pouch there were thought to reflect sequelae of prior episodes of inflammation\/pouchitis. The patient also had IBD associated SI joint arthropathy with erosive changes bilaterally, as well as an incidental findings of a probable splenic hemangioma. The patient was otherwise continued on his home regimen of rectal hydrocortisone and mesalamine. Charcot ___ crystal were seen in the patient's stool studies, which were either pending or negative on discharge, but O&P was negative x 3, and crystal were felt to be more likely from chronic GI blood loss or IBD inflammation as opposed to a parasitic infection. # Enthesitis: The patient's description of his pain does not sounds very joint related, but on exam appears to be more associated with a tendopathy or an enthesitis. Rheumatology was consulted, and agreed the pain was likely IBD associated spondyloarthropathy, and recommended starting treatment with sulfazalaine, with a possible need to start IV steroids and other immunomodulatory therapy. The patient's pain was initially controlled with IV Dilaudid, subsequently converted to PO oxycodone. Rheumatology follow-up was made within the month, with a particular focus on the findings on CT of IBD associated SI joint arthropathy with erosive changes bilaterally. # Pouchitis: The patient has a history of pouchitis, which sounds as though it has been present since ___, and that he has been off and on antibiotics since that time. His urine culture and U\/A were negative for infection, and blood cultures were pending at the time of his discharge, but were negative to date. His stool cultures were all negative as described in the Microbiology section of results. He was discharged on his home dose of Cipro and Flagyl. # Microcytic anemia: Iron studies show a profound microcytic iron deficiency anemia, despite the PO supplementation with TID iron. The patient was trialed on a x 1 dose of 750 mg iron, which he appeared to tolerate well; however, given his profound anemia, as well as his likely lack of iron absorption, it was deferred as an outpatient to consider the initiation of IV iron therapy. B12 and folate studies were within normal limits. # Thrombocytosis: Etiologies include possibly essential thrombocytosis, although patient does not have an increase in RBCs or granulocytes, or a reactive thrombocytosis, such as from infection, or acute bleeding. Given the patient's known history of IBD, his thrombyctosis was felt likely reactive from inflammation of his known disease.

She completed a course of antibiotics for her pneumonia, was already on maximal medical therapy for stroke prevention and treatment, and began antiepileptic treatment with Keppra. Because of her altered mental status and stroke, she failed speech and swallow and ultimately required placement of a nasogastric tube for nutrition. On admission she also had elevated troponins, which were attributed to demand ischemia, and LFTs, both of which had resolved. She has improved slightly since admission--she is alert and interactive--though far from baseline; her recovery from the stroke is likely limited given presence of vascular dementia and multiple cardiac comorbidities. ================= ACTIVE ISSUES ================= # Altered mental status: At baseline she has dementia but is normally talkative and responsive. She was found unresponsive ___ @ ~5:30AM after going to sleep the night before, so it was unclear when the insult occurred. Initial evaluation did not show any evidence of bleeding (NCHCT), significant electrolyte abnormalities (only had slight hyponatremia to 133, hypocalcemia to 8.3 with ionized calcium 1.07, and hypomagnesemia to 0.9 which improved with repletion), or digoxin toxicity (level 0.9; no bradycardia or AV block on EKG and Cr at baseline). There was concern for infection give patient's history of becoming slightly confused with UTIs, but initially she was afebrile and without leukocytosis. Her UA was clear and CXR showed evidence of potential LLL PNA. She was started on broad spectrum antibiotics, which were discontinued after a negative LP on ___. However, that evening, she spiked a fever and developed hypoxia (see active issue \"Pneumonia\" below) and was restarted on antibiotics, which were later narrowed. Her full antiobiotic course is listed below. An MRI also revealed evidence of a stroke (see active issue \"Stroke\" below). Because patient continued to exhibit abulia and remained minimally verbal (though improved from admission), an EEG was obtained, which showed abnormal discharges (see active issue \"Abnormal EEG\" below). Antibiotic history: -Vanc 1000mg IV bid ___ -Zosyn 4.5g IV q8hr ___ -Ampicillin 2g IV q6hr ___ -Cefepime 2g IV bid ___ -Levofloxacin 750mg IV daily ___ # Ischemic Stroke: She exhibited persistent left-sided weakness, depressed mental status, aspiration, and non-specific EEG changes. MRI on ___ showed a small acute infarct in the right caudate and a questionable focus in the left frontal lobe. Family was informed that she has a guarded prognosis given that she developed a stroke on optimal medical management of stroke risk factors and limited recovery since presentation. Because she is already anticoagulated on warfarin, she does not require additional treatment with aspirin. # Abnormal EEG: Video EEG monitoring started on ___. She was noted to have beta and delta wave slowing with non-specific discharges and some focality in temporal region, consistent with possible metabolic toxic abnormality. At the recommendation of neurology, she was started on Keppra (500mg -> 750mg bid) and showed improvement on EEG. # Community Aquired Pneumonia: Five day course of antibiotics completed. Patient had RLL infiltrate on admission chest x-ray, fever, and hypoxemia. # Aspiration Concern for aspiration from CXR obtained for fever\/hypoxia on ___.

After initial unsuccessful attempts at NGT placement, she received one on ___ and was started on tube feeds of Glucerna 1.2 @ 55ml\/hr, which she tolerated well # Goals of Care Family meetings were held throughout her hospitalization. Ultimately, the decision was to make Ms. ___ DNR\/DNI given that CPR is not indicated for her. On the day before discharge, a family meeting was held with ___ (HCP, daughter), ___ (son), ___ (husband), Dr. ___ from palliative care, and her primary team. We offfered a framework for discussing three realms of priorities: (a) comfort & dignity, (b) length of days, (c) physical location of care. Also discussed the options for feeding and the risks \/ benefits of each: (a) nasogastric tube, (b) PEG tube, (c) supervised feeding by mouth. Patient is being transferred to an acute rehabilitation facility to optimize her chances of recovery from her acute stroke, and to continue a trial of tube feeds. However, ___ ___, is far from home and difficult for her husband, ___ to access as he does not drive long distances. Family plans to convene with patient's brothers on ___ and ask her what she wants, and honor her wishes. They hope to ultimately bring the patient closer to home. ___ signed DNR\/DNI form which is placed in paper chart and copy was given to her. # Transaminitis: Elevated AST\/ALT and alk pho with normal bili, suggesting hepatocellular pattern. Wide differential with negative work-up included: hepatitis (viral abs negative), medication effect (statin held initially), a\/calculous cholecystitis (would expect leukocytosis and higher LFTs; further RUQ U\/S on ___ negative), or parasitic infection (smear negative). LFTs downtrended to within normal limits and her statin was restarted. However, upon restarting atorvastatin 80mg, her LFTs were beginning to trend up again. She previously tolerated atorvastatin at a dose of 20mg, so upon discharge, atorvastatin was reduced to 40mg. LFTs should be repeated after several days of the decreased dose. # Periorbital edema \/ erythema: Likely due to fluid overload \/ hypoalbuminemia. Negative screening tests for inflammatory disease \/ multiple myeloma. ================= INACTIVE ISSUES ================= # Congestive Heart Failure: Diastolic dysfunction with recent LVEF 40% on ___ TTE. CXR on ___ revealed patchy diffuse opacities so diuretics were restarted. BNP at that time was ___. She was discharged on her home medications. # Troponinemia: Troponins elevated at the ED and peaked ___ at 0.30 without elevated CK-MB (5, 6) or acute EKG changes, suggesting demand ischemia without infarction. Underlying causes for increased demand likely infection or CHF exacerbation (see above). Of note, patient had similar elevation of troponins in the recent past. TTE performed on ___ notable for left ventricular systolic function that is mildly to moderately depressed (LVEF= 40 %) with inferior\/infero-lateral hypokinesis and septal dysynchrony \/ hypokinesis. # Atrial Fibrillation: Chronic condition; CHADS2 score of 4 (CHF, HTN, Age, DM). She was monitored on telemetry and appropriately anticoagulated (reversed temporarily for LP procedure on ___. We discussed with her family on ___ that her stroke is likely secondary to AF and that patient is already receiving maximal treatment for this. # Coronary artery disease: History of MI in ___. Cardiac medications as above. # Diabetes Mellitus Type 2: On metformin at home, treated with insulin sliding scale while inpatient. Proteinuria was seen on admission UA. # Chronic Issues -Anemia ___ B12 and iron deficiency): continue B12 1000mcg daily -GERD: held omeprazole 20mg daily given potential to cause hypomagnesemia ==================== TRANSITIONAL ISSUES ==================== -code status: DNR\/DNI, CPR not indicated, discussed with health care proxy (___) in presence of secondary health care proxy (___) and husband (___) -please check LFTs on ___, atorvastatin dosage reduced ___ for mild LFT elevation, if LFTs do not improve or worsen, consider discontinuing or changing to pravastatin -ongoing anticoagulation management for afib on warfarin, next INR check on ___ -recommend repeat speech & swallow evaluation on or after ___, to help guide discussions about nutrition -follow-up with neurology 1 mo after discharge to rehab -with future infections, avoid antibiotics that significantly lower seizure threshold","summary":"You were admitted because your family found ___ unresponsive in your bed. We performed an extensive work-up that showed evidence of a recent stroke, a likely pneumonia, and small areas of abnormal discharges on EEG brain monitoring which may put ___ at risk for seizures. ___ did not require any additional medications for your stroke because ___ already taking the appropriate ones. ___ completed a course of antibiotics for your pneumonia. Finally, ___ started an antiseizure medication called Keppra. After your stroke, when eating or drinking, food would sometimes go down the wrong pipe and into your lungs. Because of this, ___ received feedings through a tube that goes directly to your stomach. In the ED, they also found that your troponin levels were elevated. Troponin is an enzyme that indicates how much stress the heart is experiencing. Because another heart-specific laboratory test (CK-MB) was normal and because your EKG did not show any new changes, we did not think that ___ were having a heart attack. Instead, we think your heart was just stressed from the underlying infection and stroke. Additionally, in the ED, they found that your liver enzymes were elevated. We did an ultrasound of your abdomen that showed a normal liver and gallbladder. Your gallbladder did have gallstones, which are common in older individuals, but they were not blocking anything. We also checked for possible infections that could cause this, such as hepatitis, but those tests were negative. The liver enzymes decreased to their normal levels after a few days, however, and there is no evidence of any liver problems anymore. Thank ___ for choosing the ___ for your care."}

{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: ___ yo female with CKD, HTN, diastolic CHF, AF on coumadin, s\/p nephrectomy, chronic right pleural effusion with pleurex catheter in place, and chronic bilateral massive edema presents with leg erythema consistent with cellulitis. Course complicated by new diagnosis of lung cancer, acute on chronic renal failure, acute on chronic CHF exacerbation, anemia and thrombocytopenia ACTIVE ISSUES: # CELLULITIS: Unilateral erythema and warmth in right leg consistent with infection. She was initially started on broad coverage with IV vancomycin on ___ and was narrowed on ___ to doxycycline with very good effect. She finished a 7 day course of doxycycline on ___ # ADENOCARCINOMA OF THE LUNG: Pleural fluid cytology was consistent with adenocarcinoma of the lung. Thus, the effusion was likely partially malignant in nature. She will likely not pursue further therapy but will follow-up with oncology as an outpatient to discuss options. # PLEURAL EFFUSIONS: Multifactorial. Pleural fluid studies were mostly consistent with transudate but LDH elevated suggesting exudate. Initially attributed to acute on chronic diastolic heart failure but patient failed to improve with diuresis. Diagnosis of lung cancer was then made from the cytology thus suggesting the effusion could be partially malignant in nature. She was initially diuresed aggressively with IV lasix and effectively lost volume, but effusions did not improve much, likely as they were partially malignant in origin. She already had a pleural catheter in place on the right so this was drained multiple times during her hospitalization for 300-500cc each time. Given her persistent left effusion despite diuresis this was drained by thoracentesis with a total of 1.2L removed. She experienced good relief initially, but unfortunately the effusion reaccumulated quickly, so IP placed a pleurex catheter on ___ for periodic drainage at rehab and at home. Her lasix was initially increased but then decreased back to her home dose at discharge. New dry weight is ~62.1kg. # ANEMIA AND THROMBOCYTOPENIA: Noted incidentally to have a decrease in platelets from previously normal values to 60-70K on admission, which appears to have developed in ___. She also had a slow decrease in her hemoglobin\/hematocrit over that time period and some positive markers of hemolysis, including a positive coomb's test. Given these two findings, it was thought that she may have ___ (warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia). Hematology was consulted and reviewed her smear, which was not consistent with hemolytic anemia, so they thought anemia may be due to chronic slow blood loss (esp given coumadin use). Thrombocytopenia thought to be ITP vs drug-induced, so ranitidine was stopped since that is a medication that can have this effect. Platelets improved to >100K on discharge. She will follow up with hematology on ___ and should have her CBC monitored at her next PCP ___. # ACUTE ON CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE: Cr up to 1.8 from baseline ~1.4 on admission. Likely due to cardiorenal syndrome and venous congestion, as creatinine actually improved back to baseline with diuresis. INACTIVE ISSUES BY PROBLEM: # ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: Coumadin held intermittently during hospitalization for planned procedures such as the thoracentesis and pleurex placement, but it was restarted on discharge. She should have her next INR on ___ at rehab. # CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE: Plavix held prior to pleurex placement. Since patient's last stent was in ___ and is on coumadin, plavix was dc'ed on discharge. Continued on statin and metoprolol. Not on aspirin due to allergy. # HYPOTHYROIDISM: Continued on home dose of levothyroxine TRANSITIONS OF CARE: - CHF: dc'd on lasix 40mg daily (home dose), needs daily weights (dry weight 62.1kg) - Pleural effusions: pleurex catheters now bilateral (left placed ___, should be drained 3x\/weekly at least or as symptoms arise - Anemia and thombocytopenia: should have CBC at next PCP appt after discharge from rehab. Follow up with hematology on ___ - Anticoagulation: restarted coumadin after pleurex procedure, should have next INR on ___. ___ clinic will manage dosage after discharge from rehab - FULL CODE though this should be re-addressed given patient's new cancer diagnosis","summary":"You were admitted to the hospital due to an infection in your leg, which improved with antibiotics. We also found that you had a lot of extra fluid in your lungs, which we removed with furosemide and by draining it with a needle. Unfortunately the fluid returned very quickly, so the lung doctors put ___ tube on the left side (similar the one you have on the right). This way the fluid can be drained regularly if necessary."}

Now s\/p TSICU stay with stable H\/H. Current course in complicated by hyponatremia of unknown etiology. ACTIVE ISSUES: #TSICU COURSE: Mr. ___ was met in the emergency department at ___ by the trauma surgery service after his motor vehicle crash on ___ and transfer from ___. He underwent extensive imaging and was ultimately brought to the intensive care unit for monitoring. Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Spine were consulted. His coumadin was held and his hematocrit checked every 4 hours. His hyponatremia was gently corrected. Overnight, the patient was hemodynamically stable and his hematocrit was also stable. The following morning, the patient's cervical collar was cleared. He was given a regular diet. He got out of bed to a chair. The patient was transferred to the floor under the care of the medicine service. #Hyponatremia: On exam, euvolemic. Urine electrolytes with UOsms=480, UNa 95, all c\/w SIADH. He has a history of SIADH as an outpatient previously. The etiology of this is unclear. On ___ his Na was 129. He has had a progressive ___ from ___ with Na dropping 139->137->131->129. Could be 2'\/2 old infarct, head trauma from the accident, or ?malignancy in his kidney or pancreas. Post trauma pain could have also contributed. He was fluid restricted 2L\/d with rise to 133-136. #R Occipital Stroke: per MRI and MRA imaging this is NOT acute and not likely to be 2'\/2 trauma. It is possible that this stroke may have caused visual loss leading to his accident. A TTE was negative for cardiac source of emboli. #Delirium: Initially had episodes of delirium, believing he was in a grocery store, etc. This improved after his gabapentin and oxycodone were held. He had a UA and chest imaging on admission. Remained afebrile.

Continued evaluation and work up in outpatient clinic is appropriate. Recommend checking Chem panel within 4 days of discharge and decrease fluid allowance as needed (currently 2L fluid restriction, could consider 1.5L if sodium trends down). #HTN: Initially held Lisinopril 5mh and HCTZ 12.5mg due to normal BP and liver lac, but with high blood pressures HCTZ was restarted in addition to ongoing diltiazem for rate control. His blood pressures were low-normal. Upon further discussion, lisinopril would be the preferred agent given her CKD, so on discharge plan is to hold HCTZ and start lisinopril ___. Giving all anti-hypertensive medications in AM led to morning borderline-low pressures. Please administer diltiazem in AM and lisinopril in the evening. Can add back HCTZ as required. #Stroke: will need formal visual field testing by ophthalmology as an outpatient. Consider followup with vascular neurology as outpatient. #Incidental findings: 2.5cm cyst in left kidney should be further assessed by ultrasound or MRI nonurgently.

{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: Ms. ___ was admitted to the ___ oncology medicine team on ___ following a scheduled clinic visit with Dr. ___ ___ fellow). As above, she presented with generalized malaise, nausea, and vomiting 8 days after her most recent chemotherapy infusion. Clinic lab results identified a hypokalemia and hyponatremia. She noted she had recently been taking care of her god son, who she later realized was suffering from an upper respiratory infection. Her hospital course by problem is identified as follows: # Hypokalemia - Upon evaluation in clinic, Ms. ___ potassium level was determined to be low, with a value of 2.9. While still in clinic, she was repleted with 40 mEq potassium intravenously plus an additional 40 mEq PO. Upon arrival to the oncology floor, her potassium was rechecked and found to still be hypokalemic. She was given 40 mEq orally, and then placed on a sliding scale repletion schedule. Prior to discharge her potassium rose to 3.6. Etiology of her hypokalemia was surmised to be seconday to her recent nausea and vomiting, likely chemotherapy induced. She was sent home with oral potassium medication for several days until her next lab draw could be completed. # Hyponatremia - Ms. ___ was hyponatremic to 128 in clinic. Examination and labarotory inquiry determined this was a euvolemic hyponatremic hyponatremia, potentially secondary to SIADH caused by her underlying non-small cell adenocarcinoma. She was free water restricted to 1.5L\/day, after which her serum sodium levels rose appropriately to 132 prior to discharge. Additionally, her hypertension had been managed prior to admission using chlorthalidone (in addition to atenolol). Her chlorthalidone was held, assuming this may play a small role in her hyponatremia. Her blood pressure was managed as discussed below. # Nausea\/vomiting - Despite endorsing nausea on arrival to clinic, Ms. ___ did not experience any nausea or vomiting while hospitalized. Ondansetron was available if needed, though she did not receive any doses. Additionally, she was maintained on her outpatient ranitidine, which she stated had quieted her abdominal discomfort and nausea during previous recoveries following chemotherapy. # Leukopenia\/neutropenia - Ms. ___ was leukopenic on arrival, and became neutropenic on hospitalization day 2. She did not exhibit fever during her stay, and antibiotics were not initiated. She was instructed to take careful consideration into avoiding infection upon discharge. # HTN - Ms. ___ cancer therapy course has been complicated by hypertension, managed prior to admission with chlorthalidone and atenolol. Chlorthalidone was stopped on admission due to her ongoing hyponatremia. Atenolol was also held, given normal vital signs on arrival as well as the desire to switch to a medication with a wider therapeutic window. She was started on amlodipine 5 mg PO daily and had blood pressures within normal limits throughout her hospitalization. # Cough\/malaise - Ms. ___ generalized malaise was attributed to her recent chemotherapy cycle. She stated she felt this way previously after chemotherapy, but this was slightly more severe. Her recent exposure to her god son's upper respiratory infection (likely viral) may have also contributed. She received a chest x-ray on admission to rule-out a pneumonia, which showed signs of stable neoplastic disease but was otherwise normal. ================================= TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: Ms. ___ remained full code throughout the course of her hospitalization. She will require labs a few days after discharge to follow-up on her electrolyte values.","summary":"You were admitted to ___ for electrolyte abnormalities and a low white blood cell count. Your electrolytes were monitored closely. We stopped the medication called chlorthalidone as that likely contributed to the low sodium and potassium.

Soon after arrival to the hospital he became acutely agitated and violent, requiring physical and chemical restraints. The ingested substance(s) were never definitely established, but the toxidrome and history pointed toward a synthetic cannabinoid ingestion (patient's girlfriend at one point admitted that patient had recent \"K-2\" use). Tox screen was positive for benzodiazepines and oxycodone. PCP screen was sent and was pending at discharge. Collateral from patient's girlfriend revealed that he told her that he had used K2 and heroin, which he admitted to psychiatry moonlighter on ___. He later told that psychiatry ___ on ___ that he had used Xanax and gabapentin. His agitation in the ED manifested as violent thrashing and uncooperative behavior requiring multiple security personnel to restrain him for the safe administration of medications. He required large doses of benzodiazepines, neuroleptics, and ketamine and was eventually intubated for airway protection. While intubated, he required large doses of propofol, fentanyl, and precedex with intermittent breakthrough midazolam to maintain safe and adequate sedation. On ___, he was extubated however developed severe agitation with required 4-point leather restraints and escalating doses Haldol, thorazine, and lorazepam. Ultimately, the patient's agitation became so violent that he required re-initiation of propofol and fentanyl with re-intubation. Psychiatry was emergently consulted and recommended control of agitation with liberal use of benzodiazepines given high suspicion for synthetic cannabinoid ingestion. By ___, patient was able to be extubated again. Agitation was controlled with benzodiazepines and intermittent physical restraints. Agitation slowly waned and patient became more cooperative. His family and loved ones agreed that he was returning to his baseline mental status. Hospital course was complicated by rhabdomyolysis with CK peaking >6000, likely secondary to violent thrashing against restraints. he was treated with IV fluids with sustained downtrending CK.

You were found unresponsive and then became extremely agitated and demonstrated dangerous behavior. In addition, you had injury to your muscles (rhabdomyolysis) causing a high level of CK in the blood, which can cause kidney damage. All of these problems were probably the result of drug use, likely from synthetic cannabinoids (for example, K-2). To control your agitation and to keep you safe, you required large doses of powerful medications to calm you. At times your behavior was so dangerous that you had to be heavily sedated and put on a breathing machine. To protect your kidneys from the muscle breakdown, you received intravenous fluids. Finally, you were evaluated and followed by the psychiatry department as well as the hospital social worker. You need to stay hydrated by drinking lots of water and lead a healthy lifestyle.

According to the ___, she had not been eating since she was transferred to this unit 5 days ago and seems to have been testing the limits of this facility by her dietary non-compliance. On D\/W Dr ___ had multiple complaints and when seen in the ED the report was that she may have been factitiously trying to feign neuro signs and would appear fatigued but when not watched she was normal. Other symptoms were only by her report and included not passing urine for 3 days and not having a bowel motion in 12 days. She had evidence of fecal loading on her KUB which was in keeping with constipation and was treated with a bowel regimen. She is very manipulative and it has been difficult to interpret whether these self-reported symptoms were bogus\/factitious although the difficulty in her case is that she has had serious previous medical problems. She was reviewed by her O\/P psychiatrist Dr ___ on ___ and his feeling was to stop trazodone and aim for a short hospital stay once medically stable. She had complaints regarding possible allergy to casein (this would cut out a lot of the dietary supplements and boosts to aid in her weight gain) and that this was managed with \"pediatric EpiPens\"?? In a patient who has had potentially serious tachyarrhythmias giving epinephrine would not be a good idea unless this was to treat significant allergy\/anaphylaxis. She noted some episode of vomiting after her Ensure which she said was related to her \"allergies\" but there was no evidence of SOB, wheezing or hives. She also shoed evidence of functional neurological symptoms or indeed factitious disorder. On transfer back from X-ray patient had an episode of staring into space and when roused by the start of a sternal rub by Nursing Staff she appeared to be disoriented. Afterwards she reported that she had fallen while staff let her use the bathroom, hit her head twice and briefly lost consciousness on the floor although neglected to mention this at the time. On my review neurologically, she had an entirely functional\/factitious exam with \"give way\" weakness in all 4 limbs, despite normal reflexes and muscle tone and the most striking findings were of eye movement examination where she would initially look to extremes of gaze and then inappropriately re-adjust her gaze to make it appear that she had limitation in movement, she also noted abnormal left facial sensation and slow tongue movements. She also had a completely functional cerebellar exam with completely exaggerated \"stuttering\" and \"pseudo-clonus\" of heel-shin and on finger-nose she described diplopia and could simply not touch the examiners finger despite having entirely intact coordination. These features are concerning as it seems that she has had several episodes of disorientation and pseudo-neurological symptoms which may easily be mis-interpreted by the untrained observer. These concerns of malignant psychopathy with now functional\/factitious symptoms were communicated to her out-patient psychiatrist, Dr ___ previous in-patient psychiatrist Dr ___. Just prior to discharge she complained of allergy and that she could not swallow and spoke in an inappropriate whisper with normal breath sounds on auscultation and no wheeze and appeared to be trying to emulate anaphylaxis. She attributed this to the casein in her Ensure. This passed and she was quickly able to talk normally but gives further credence to her functional symptomatology. She was medically cleared and transferred back to the ___ on ___. . # Weakness\/?Syncope: There was no evidence of electrolyte abnormality, she had a normal ECG and her weight was higher than her previous discharge in ___. However given her poor PO intake, the cause of this was likely orthostatic in additional to nutritional deficiency and generalised low BP. She was seen to be orthostatic on heart rate and no postural BP drop. Patient has had tachyarrythmias in the past but there was no evidence of this on continuous telemetry. She appeared dehydrated and received IV fluids. She reportedly had syncope for years and also stated that she was getting worked up at ___ in addition regarding \"allergies\" although it was not possible to confirm this. She was hydrated and her labs remained stable. She was treated as per the Eating Disorders Protocol while in house. We continued MVI, Calcium, Vitamin D, B12. She had a possibly spurious un-witnessed fall with LOC as is described below. . # Functional\/factitious neurological symptoms\/pseudoseizures: On transfer back from X-ray patient had an episode of staring into space and when roused by the start of a sternal rub by Nursing Staff she appeared to be disoriented. Afterwards she reported that she had fallen while staff let her use the bathroom, hit her head twice and briefly lost consciousness on the floor although neglected to mention this at the time. On my review neurologically, she had an entirely functional\/factitious exam with \"give way\" weakness in all 4 limbs, despite normal reflexes and muscle tone and the most striking findings were of eye movement examination where she would initially look to extremes of gaze and then inappropriately re-adjust her gaze to make it appear that she had limitation in movement, she also noted abnormal left facial sensation and she had inappropriately slow tongue movements.

These features are concerning as it seems that she has had several episodes of disorientation and pseudo-neurological symptoms which may easily be mis-interpreted by the untrained observer. These concerns of malignant psychopathy with now functional\/factitious symptoms were communicated to her out-patient psychiatrist, Dr ___ previous in-patient psychiatrist Dr ___. She was discharged to the ___ on ___. . # Urinary Retention: Per ED, the patient did urinate but tried to hide this from staff so there was an unclear history. Given risk of infection with Foley catheter, this was removed and urine-output was monitored. She had another unwitnessed void. monitor urine output closely. We held Benadryl as there were no \"allergies\". . # Constipation: We started a bowel regimen with docusate, senna, Miralax. AXR ___ showed heavy fecal load throughout the descending and sigmoid colon as well as significant amount of feces seen distending the rectum. If she does not improve, Metoclopramide could be added in the community. . # Anorexia Nervosa: She has been very difficult to manage and has had considerable medical problems as a result of this. She was treated with IV fluids and rehydrated for dehydration. She was manipulative and vomited her ensure on ___ complaining that this was due to \"allergies\" and that her mother had similar problems and that she should be treated with pediatric EpiPens. She was not given Benadryl and certainly no EpiPens in the context of someone with previous VT and other arrhythmias. She was treated with the Eating Disorders protocol. Psychiatry reviewed and recommended stopping trazodone as can cause postural hypotension. They also wanted if possible to track down details of her potentially spurious autoimmune workup and allergy but this was not possible at this time. We continued clonazepam TID before meals as per outpatient treatment . # PTSD\/Depression\/Anxiety: We continued Clonazepam, Trazodone and Hydroxizine per her home medications.","summary":"You were admitted due to concerns that you were not urinating and not eating well in addition to episodes where you felt faint and lost consciousness.

Pneumonia: Patient was treated for viral vs. bacterial (more likely given focal findings on CXR and recent hospitalization) pneumonia. He initially received Tamiflu until influenza A and B negative results were obtained. Given recent hospitalization, he also received ceftaz\/vancomycin for hospial acquired pneumonia for 3 days. After being afebrile for 48hrs with negative cultures, patient was transitioned to high dose Levofloxacin (adjusted for renal function) for 5 days. He was discharged with 2 additional days of 250mg PO QD to be completed on ___. Various evaluations were used to define the pathogen without success. A sputum specimen was determined to be contaminated by upper respiratory secretions. A urine legionella ag was negative and liver function tests were within normal limits. . 2. Diastolic cardiac dysfunction: Patient has chronic disease thought to be a major contributor to his respiratory distress given clinical setting of recently discontinued diuretic, depedent pulmonary crackles, and visibly volume overloaded with 1+ pitting edema to the knee. He has a history of diastolic heart failure with EF of 65-70% on last ECHO. Torsemide was discontinued during and after last hospitalization out of concern for dehydration. After admission, patient was diuresed with escalating doses of diuretics. Patient was discharged at a weight of 180lbs. Baseline weight was previously reported as 178lbs. He was discharged on his home torsemide dose of 20mg PO daily. Patient will be followed with ___, weight monitoring, dietary instructions, and multiple follow-up appointments. . 3. Acute on chronic renal failure: Patient has with chronic kidney insufficiency (baseline crt 2.2 in the inpatient setting, but outpatient baseline of 3.0 according to ___ records thought to reflect more accurate baseline). His creatinine increased likely related to dehydration with insensible losses poor oral intake with current illness, this is moderately supported by a BUN:Cr ratio of close to 20:1. Negative eosinophiluria, lack of predominant fever, and minimal urine white and red blood cells argued against acute interstitial nephritis. Throughout admission he his blood pressure was monitored, nephrotoxins were avoided, and his medications were renally dosed. His allopurinol and valsartan medications were held during the admission in the setting of ARF to prevent exacerbation. Prior to discharge his valsartan was restarted at a lower dose (from 160mg\/d to 40mg\/d) per renal consultation. At admission his Cr increased to 3.5 on ___ and then decreased to 2.9 and 3.0 prior to Discharge which is felt to be the patient's baseline. The patient will be called by his primary nephrologist's office to schedule follow up. . 4. Anemia: Patient demonstrated normocytic anemia. The hematocrit decreased from baseline throughout admission, likely related to phlebotomy and EPO deficiency secondary to renal disease. Hematocrit dropped throughout admission with a nadar of 23.4. On ___ anemia labs revealed TIBC of 173, Ferritin of 151, TRF of 133. We initiated iron supplementaiton to improve anemia and demonstrate persistent anemia despite Ferritin>200 and Transferrin Sat>20% in order to allow patient to qualify fro EPO treatment in the future. A follow-up appointment was arranged with Dr. ___ at ___. There anemia of chronic disease, inflammation, and phlebotomy components. Patient continued on iron supplementation, may consider EPO with Nephrologist on outpatient basis. . 7. Diabetes mellitus, type II: Patient has poorly controlled diabetes with a HgbA1C of 10.1 on ___ and previous seizure episode thought to be precipitated by hyperglycemia. While in the hospital he recieved between ___ glargine at night and a sliding scale. Blood sugars ranged from 64-280 and were consistently in the 200s and low 300s by ___, except in the mornings after we increased Insulin to 15U Glargine QHS. When patient's evening glargine dose was increased to 15U his morning finger sticks decreased to 60-95. He was returned to his home dose of glargine, 9U QHS prior to discharge for fear of hypoglycemia given reported past episodes and concerns that sugars were more elevated than normal for patient in the setting of infection. His insulin regimen should be addressed in the outpatient setting given difficulty titrating dosing in the setting of infection. We continued aspirin and ___ given their benefit in diabetic patients. . 7. Seizure: There was concern for a recent seizure episode thought to be precipitated by hyperglycemia. Patient did not demonstrate signs or symptoms consistent with seizure activity throughout his admission. He did not receive any anti-epileptic medications. He has follow up with neurology. . 8. Hypertension: Patient was continued on minoxidil and metoprolol per his home dosing regimens. Valsartan was decreased per renal consult, to be re-evaluated at follow up appointment. . 9.

Cytologic evaluation was negative for malignant cells and no microorganisms were seen on gram stain or culture. After the procedure her pain had improved, though not completely. Our team believed this was most likely due to the multiple cysts that were not drained. We spoke extensively with the patient regarding the utility of further aspiration procedures. We noted that is very difficult to determine which cysts are generating her pain and that the cysts can re-accumulate fluid. Also explained the risk of infection and bleeding with each additional procedure. Given that her pain was \"tolerable\", she elected to defer any additional procedures at this time. We told her this can be readdressed as an outpatient if her pain level changes. Additionally, patient had diarrhea for ___ days after her procedure. This was likely related to an overly aggressive bowel regimen which was started given her presenting complaint of constipation. She was sent home with a bowel regimen to use as needed.","summary":"You were having abdominal pain. An imaging study of your belly showed many large fluid collections known as \"cysts\".

{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: Mr. ___ is a ___ year old man with Hb SS disease who presents with abdominal pain & diarrhea, as well as leukocytosis and anemia, with evidence of colitis on CT abdomen\/pelvis. ACTIVE ISSUES # Colitis: Etiology thought to be infectious vs. ischemic. No blood in stool and guaiac negative in ED. Fevers and leukocytosis favored infectious etiology (though possibly ischemic vs vaso-occlusive crisis). Distribution favored watershed infarct. Abdomen rather benign on exam. Surgery evaluated patient in ED and recommended conservative medical management. Patient was given aggressive IV hydration, as well as empiric ciprofloxacin and metronidazole to cover for possible infectious colitis. C. diff PCR was negative. Stool studies pending on discharge, though diarrhea (initially present on admission) resolved with antibiotic therapy. He tolerated regular diet prior to discharge. Leukocytosis resolved. He is discharged with plan for 7 days of antibiotic therapy through ___. # Sickle cell disease # Vaso-occlusive crisis # Pain crisis: Patient presented with anemia, diffuse body pain, and evidence of hemolysis with low haptoglobin, elevated LDH & indirect bilirubin and reticulocytosis. There was no evidence of cerebral or coronary involvement; as such, exchange pheresis not performed on admission. Patient received IVF hydration, and transfused 2uPRBC given his anemia for goal Hgb>7. Pain managed with PO Tylenol, PO hydromorphone, and ketorolac. After transfer from FICU to the medicine floor he had worsening bone pain and was treated for one day on PCA. His pain quickly improved and he was transitioned back to his home pain regimen, which he tolerated well prior to discharge. Of note, he has not reliably been taking hydroxyurea as an outpatient. The patient's primary hematologist was emailed on discharge to discuss timing of re-initiation and PCP ___. Transitional: - Continue cipro\/flagyl through ___ - Awaiting recommendation from hematology regarding timing of re-initiation of hydroxyurea","summary":"You were admitted with abdominal pain and an exacerbation of your sickle cell anemia. You were found to have an infection of your colon (colitis) and this likely caused your pain crisis. You were initially admitted to the ICU but were ultimately transferred to the general medical floor where you continued to improve. You will be discharged to complete a course of antibiotics for your colitis. You will resume your home pain regimen."}

{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: ___ with a history of CRI, CHF, Afib, and recent cellulitis treated with cephalexin and trimethoprim\/sulfamethoxazole who presented with acute on chronic renal insufficiency. . # ACUTE on CHRONIC RENAL INSUFFICIENCY: Patient's baseline creatinine is 2.3. It was elevated in the ED on hospital day 1 to 3.8 then has trended down to 3.2 at the day of discharge. The most likely cause of the patient's acute on chronic renal failure was due to AIN from cephalexin and\/or Bactrim which he was being treated for right leg cellulitis. He had eosinophils in his urine and blood, with mild proteinuria (protein:creatinine ratio of 0.2). The patient's FeUrea was 46% which makes unlikely to be due to prerenal causes. The timeline fits with AIN, as the patient began taking the antibiotics about 10 days ago. He stated to have poor po intake in the last few days making pre-renal causes possible contributory to worsening kidney fx. He also had complains of difficulty urinating and has hx of BPH, renal US r\/o hydronephritis and other post renal reasons. He was given gentle hydration due to the CHF hx, antibiotics were stopped and he was given one dose of vanocomycin to tx cellulitis. IV lasix were initially held and restarted prior to d\/c given that creatine was close to baseline. He will have f\/u labs as outpatient 1 day after discharge. . # HYPERKALEMIA: Patient's K+ was elevated to 5.3 on admission likely due to worsening renal function. His k trended down to 4.5 after treatment with Kayexalate. K was 4.8 at time of discharge. The patient was placed on telemetry for monitoring, and he was in Afib with very occasional PVCs. . # BPH: Patient complains of increased difficulty urinating recently.

He was continued on his home dose of tamsulosin. . # LLE CELLULITIS: Pt has hx of chronic venous stasis and was recently hospitalized ___ for LLE cellulitis. Patient received 10 of 14 days of antibiotics, Bactrim and Keflex. Both antibiotics were discontinued due to worsen renal fx as noted above. His left ___ wound as per patient appears much improved. He has small healing ulcers on his L shin area. Otherwise cellulitis appears to be resolved. He was given one dose of vancomycin and cipro at admission which may stay on his system for a few days.

The patient's statin and his atenolol were continued during his hospitalization. The patient is not on aspirin as he has a history of GI bleeds. . # ANEMIA: Chronic problem, stable since admission. Patient's baseline HCT is ~33. On hospital day 2 it was 30.3, and on hospital day 3 it was 29.0, most likely resulting from hemodilution. There was no evidence of active bleeding. . # THROMBOCYTOPENIA: Chronic problem, stable since admission. Patient's baseline platelet count is ~105. On hospital day 2, count was 97. No current evidence of bleeding. On hospital day 3 the platelet count was 106. . # CHRONIC BACK PAIN: Chronic problem, currently stable.
