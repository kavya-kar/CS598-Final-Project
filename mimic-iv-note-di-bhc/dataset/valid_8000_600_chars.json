She was started on \ngabapentin, which was titrated up to 300mg TID by the time of \ndischarge.  She was also given lidocaine jelly to apply over the \npainful areas.

We treated your pain with gabapentin (Neurontin), hydromorphone (Dilaudid) and lidocaine ointment. You were also using Eucerin cream for dry skin. Your pain has been under reasonable control and we believe you can continue this regimen at home. You were also found to have a low sodium. This is likely due to a combination of your medication, hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), and your pain. For that reason, we would like for you to discontinue HCTZ and start a new medication for your blood pressure, Lisinopril."}
