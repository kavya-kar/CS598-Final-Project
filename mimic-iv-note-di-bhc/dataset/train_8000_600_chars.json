As his father had \nhistory of early demise from MI, we decided to ___. He had \nthree negative sets of cardiac enzymes and no telemetry events. \nWe discharged him on aspirin 81 mg and recommended outpatient \nstress testing. Patient received Q2H figersticks once arriving \nto floor with values of 251, 184, 166, 122, and 195 on night \nprior to discharge. He was given 24 U glargine insulin on night \nprior to discharge and put on humalog sliding scale. His \npreprandial sugar was 90 on morning of discharge. In the end, \nthe diabetic ketoacidosis all likely related to having no \ninsulin on night prior to presentation in setting of insulin \npump failure. He was asked to restart subcutaneous insulin with \n24U of glargine per night and a humalog sliding scale per his \nprior regimen.

This most likely is a benign thymic cyst. \nThere is no obvious fat or soft tissue component in the lesion \nto suggest that it could be a thymoma. Despite this, given the \nlimitations of this noncontrast exam, a follow-up MRI with \ncontrast is recommended in 3 months to ensure continued \nstability and reassess for possible enhancement. \n  \n\n \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nMr. ___ is a ___ year-old male s\/p MVC rollover.  He was taken \nto an OSH where he had a CT ___ which revealed a C4 \ntransverse process fracture, C6 facet, pedicle, and lamina \nfractures, and C7 pedicle fracture for which he was transferred \nto ___.  On HD1, the patient had a CT Torso which showed a \nlarge left renal subcapsular hematoma.

No surgical \nintervention was necessary and he was placed in a cervical \ncollar which is was instructed to wear for 8 weeks. \n\nHis hematocrit was trended and remained stable.  His creatinine \nwas also elevated to 2.7 on admission and was monitored.  His \nPCP was called and his baseline creatinine was reported to be \n1.5.  Given his creatine was downtrending, the elevated creatine \nwas attributed to his recent traumatic left renal injury and \nwill be reassessed as an outpatient. \n\nOn HD3, he received an MRI of his Mediastinum and Lung to \nevaluate the 3.9 cm well-circumscribed anterior mediastinal mass \nwhich was noted on his CT Chest.  The mass was most likely a \nbenign thymic cyst, but, because contrast was not used due to \nelevated creatinine, a follow-up MRI was recommended.  \n\nThe remainder of the ___ hospital course is summarized by \nsystems below:\n\nNeuro: The patient was alert and oriented throughout \nhospitalization; pain was managed with oral pain medication once \ntolerating a diet.   \n \nCV: The patient remained stable from a cardiovascular \nstandpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored.\n\nPulmonary: The patient remained stable from a pulmonary \nstandpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored.

During his hospital course, \nhe was increasingly able to tolerate both solids and liquids \nwithout nausea or vomiting.  CT showed thickening of the \nesophagus.  After EGD found esophagitis and gastritis, he was \neating normally, without any discomfort.  He was started on \nomeprazole 40mg BID.  Depending on the results of the EGD \nbiopsy, the patient may require endoscopic ultrasound for \nfurther evaluation of the esophageal wall thickening.  He had \none large volume, soft bowel movement after soap ___ enema in \nthe ED, and he did not have any additional bowel movements \nduring his hospitalization, most likely due to reduced food \nintake.\n.\n#EKG changes and cardiac enzyme elevations\nAdmission EKG showed evidence of V4-V6 ST segment depression, \nand this evolved to V4-V6 T wave inversion later in the hospital \ncourse.  In addition, CK and troponin were elevated when they \nwere checked during the first 3 days of admission, though the \nconsistently high levels may be a result of poor renal clearance \nrather than continuing ischemia.  Cardiology and the care team \nthought that the EKG changes and cardiac enzymes did not require \nacute intervention, and there is some suspicion of Takotsubo \ncardiomyopathy.\n.\n#Hyponatremia\nAdmission serum sodium was 122, but patient was not symptomatic. \n This was thought to be the result of low intake of sodium \nsecondary to nausea and vomiting, combined with high fluid \nretention driven by ADH in response to hypovolemia.  Sodium was \ncorrected with fluids during the hospital course.\n.\n#Diabetes mellitus type ___ managed Mr. ___ blood glucose using QHS glargine and \nHumalog sliding scale.  They felt that this was superior to the \nprevious ___ twice a day regimen, and they recommended that \nthe patient continue his 44U QHSglargine and Humalog sliding \nscale starting at 2 units for glucose 120-159, with 2 additional \nunits for every 40 mg\/dL glucose over.\n \nMedications on Admission:\nHumalog Mix 75-25, 45U in AM, 40U in ___\nLisinopril 10mg PO daily\nAspirin 81mg 2 pills PO daily in AM\nAtenolol 25mg PO daily\nDorzolamide-timolol 0.5%-2% 1 drop both eyes BID\nTestosterone 50mg\/5g Androgel gel applied daily\n \nDischarge Disposition:\nHome With Service\n \nFacility:\n___\n \nDischarge Diagnosis:\nPrimary diagnosis:\nEsphagitis\nGastritis\n\nSecondary diagnosis:\nDiabetes mellitus type ___\n\n \nDischarge Condition:\nMental Status: Clear and coherent.\nLevel of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.\nActivity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.","summary":"you came to the hospital after you had one week of nausea and vomiting after you ate. You also had constipation. You had low blood sodium levels, which improved after we gave you fluids. Your heart had some electrical signals and had elevated enzyme levels that showed it might not be getting enough blood, but the cardiology team felt that you were safe. You had a CT scan that showed some thickening of your esophagus and some gallstone. In the emergency department, you had an enema and passed a bowel movement. You later felt like you had less nausea, and you were soon able to drink liquids and eat solids without any discomfort. You misstepped and fell, causing your right big toe nail to separate. Podiatry cut your toe nail, and you had no pain afterward. You had an endoscopy, which showed inflammation of your esophagus and stomach. After the procedure, you were eating solids and liquids without any difficulty."}

Acute Care \nSurgery was consulted for management of recurrent ventral hernia \nand OB\/GYN was consulted regarding the adnexal mass. MRI of the \nabdomen and pelvis which demonstrated similar findings. \nDifferential included benign and malignant causes. Patient was \ntaken to the Operating Room in joint operation with General \nSurgery for management of hernia and OB\/GYN for management of \nadnexal mass was planned. The right adnexal mass was identified \nas a tuboovarian abscess and was drained of purulent fluid. A JP \ndrain was placed in the right adnexal region for management of \npelvic free fluid. The ventral hernia was then closed with a \nsecond JP drain left in a subcutaneous fluid pocket.\n\nThe patient was started on IV antibiotics postoperatively. She \nwas observed and diet was slowly advanced. When JP drain output \nhad diminished, after discussion with OB\/GYN, JP drains were \ndiscontinued. Postoperatively patient had a rise in serum \ncreatinine and diminished urine output. Urine electrolytes were \nconsistent with prerenal dysfunction and patient was managed \nwith IV hydration. When Cr remained, 2.0 for several days, \nnephrology was consulted. Renal ultrasound demonstrated no \nhydronephrosis. It was felt that acute kidney injury was likely \nsecondary to dehydration with accompanied postoperative toradol \nand ACE inhibitors. They recommended that patient's home \nlisinopril be discontinued. They also recommended that patient \nnot receive home chlorthalidone and that she avoid NSAIDs.\n\nBy the day of discharge, patient's Cr had begun to decline, \nurine output was adequate and Foley catheter was discontinued. \nShe was able to void spontaneously and it was felt that it was \nsafe for her to return home. She was tolerating a regular diet, \nwas ambulating well with a walker and needed O2 only \nintermittently (which she had used prior to discharge). She was \ndischarged on PO antibiotics (levofloxacin and metronidazole) \nfor a total of 2 weeks. She will follow up with her PCP, OB\/GYN \nand ACS.\n\nRELEVANT IMAGING:\nCT Abdomen and Pelvis ___:  \n\"1.

You did have some mild dehydration and were given IV fluids. You were evaluated by Endocrine; your labs were NOT consistent with adrenal insufficiency. We think that your nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea may have been related to a viral gastroenteritis, a side effect of your psychiatric medications, or a stress response. In consultation with your psychiatrist, we decreased your perphenazine to 6mg twice daily. You should stop taking Seroquel You may advance your diet slowly as tolerated (try simple broths and lighter foods if feeling nauseated), but please keep well hydrated to avoid feeling lightheaded. Please note that your white blood counts remain low, probably related to your psychiatric medications. This puts you at higher risk of infection. We recommend that you wear a face mask whenever you go out in public, that you avoid sick contacts, and that you wash your hands frequently to prevent spread of infection."}

His syncopal episodes and \nparoxysm of light-headedness were concerning for underlying \nconduction system disease.  Pacemaker was recommended, he was \nconsulted by the Electrophysiology team who recommended \nplacement of a pacemaker.  Additionally, because of his history \nof CVA, he was seen and evaluated by Neurology.  A head CT was \nperformed and was negative for any acute infarction or \nhemorrhage.  Ventricles and sulci were normal in size and \nconfiguration.  Neurology recommended an updated carotid \nultrasound as one had not been done for several years for \ncomparison, results of which are pending at the time of \ndischarge.  It was felt that the patient's symptoms were cardiac \nin nature and the patient elected to proceed with pacemaker \ninsertion, understanding risks and benefits.  There were no \nintraoperative complications, the patient tolerated the \nprocedure well and was placed on IV antibiotics while in house \nwith a plan for three days oral antibiotics at discharge.  His \nsurgical wound remained well approximated, with no signs of \nerythema, excess warmth, drainage or hematoma.  Surgical \ndressing consisted of gauze and Tegaderm which will remain \nintact for 72 hours.  A chest X-Ray was performed prior to \ndischarge showing good lead placement and no acute process.

The history was consistent \nwith a true syncopal event. The long pro-dromal period (>10 sec) \ndid not favor a primary cariac etiology. A vaso-vagal reaction \nversus orthostatic hypotension (dehydrated with BUN:Cr 30 on \nadmssion) were considered most likely. However, there was no \nchange in position or movement of the neck before the fall.\n.  \n1) Syncope: The patient did well while in house and had no \nfurther epidoses. Though there was no chest pain, an admission \nset of cardiac enzymes was nevertheless negative. An EKG showed \nNSR at 93bpm, LAD, TW flattening in III. Telemetry monitoring \nshowed multiple PVC's. There were two traces suspicious for \nv-tach\/fib, but on review these were artifacts (only seen in one \nlead). Echo had been carried out two weeks prior, and showed no \nsystolic dysfunction or valvular disease. An exercise stress \ntest with nuclear imaging showed no abnormality.\nGiven that the etiology of this event was not clearly defined, \nthe patient was instructed to abstain from driving for six \nmonths, to which she agreed.\n.\n2)Carotid bruits: These were detected on exam. The patient was \ncounseled as to the diagnostic options, ramifications, as well \nas potential medical and surgical management. She declined \ncarotid u\/s, stating that she would be unwilling to have \nsurgery. ASA 81 was maintained. She was instructed that if she \nchanged her mind about carotid u\/s she should schedule with her \nPCP. \n.  \n3) Cardiovascular: Patient did well on her home meds: lisinopril \n20, lovastatin 20, ASA 81. No changes were made.\n.\n3) Anemia: Her baseline appears to be in the high 30's, but she \nhas been in the low to mid 30's since ___. There may have been \nsome blood loss associated with her fall two weeks ago which \ncould account for this. Fe, TIBC, ferritin, folate, were normal. \nB12 was low-normal, but without evidence of macrocytosis. \nHaptoglobin was slightly elevated, LDH was normal. Guaiac was \nnegative. Patient was discharged with a multivitamin.\n.  \n4) Facial rash: Patient had a faint ___ rash on \nher forehead and cheeks which resolved after one day of lotion.\n.\n5) Neck\/spinous process fx from previous admission. Rads had \nrecommended outpatient MRI for further evaluation. This will \nrequire follow-up with her PCP.

We believe that this fall was caused by either a vasovagal response or dehydration or a combination of the two. We did tests to see if you had a heart attack, and these were negative. We also evaluated whether your heart had an abnormal rhythm, called an arrythmia, and we found no evidence of this as well. Finally, you had a stress test to see if your heart is receiving enough oxygen, which was without abnormality. Because we do not have a definitive diagnosis for your episode of fainting, we advise you not to drive for the next 6 months out of concern that you could have another episode. You should speak with your primary care doctor before you resume driving."}

He was most tender at the left border of \nthe sternum making costochondritis the most likely etiology. He \nnoted having subjective fevers and chills which were concerning \nfor pericarditis however EKG did not reveal any changes \nconsistent with pericarditis and there was no rub on exam. He \nhas no hx of CAD, and his only risk factor is smoking; \nfurthermore, EKG and cardiac enzymes were unremarkable despite \nongoing symptoms for several weeks and  therefore less likely to \nbe ACS. As for PE, there was no evidence on EKG to suggest right \nheart strain and the pain has been present for 3 weeks making it \nless likely.

For airway protection, he was intubated in the ER and \nstarted on a fentanyl\/versed drip, keppra loaded and \nsubsequently been seizure free. He was successfully extubated \nand transferred out of the ICU. A routine C-spine CT scan \nperformed to clear his C-spine identified the presence of air \ntracking in the retropharyngeal space, and for this, he received \n7 days of broadspectrum antibiotic therapy (IV). \n\nA head CT scan at the ___ ER showed the presence of a right \nfrontal mass, which was subsequently further characterized on \nMRI as being FLAIR hyperintense and non-contrast enhancing, and \non the differential diagnosis includes primary CNS lymphoma \nversus a metastatic lesion or gliosis\/glioma of some type. At \nthe same time, a trauma protocol torso CT scan identified a \nseries of nodes in his retroperitoneum concerning for \nmalignancy. The oncology, general surgery and neurosurgery teams \nwere consulted. While oncology recommended an excisional lymph \nnode biopsy over a brain biopsy, the nodes in his abdomen were \nthought to be in too delicate a location (between his IVC, aorta \nand duodenum) to be easily sampled without a a high risk open \nlaparotomy. An LP was performed, and on cytological analysis, he \nwas found to have hypercellular atypical lymphocytes that could \noccur with a number of benign and malignant processes. Flow \ncytometry analysis on that sample is still pending. \n\nUltimately, it was decided to discharge the patient home with \nfollow up as noted below. The patient was instructed to come to \nthe neurology clinic if he had not been contacted by the ___ \ndepartment directly for a brain biopsy admission. On discharge, \nhe was afebrile and hemodynamically stable. His neurological \nexam was normal, including tests of frontal lobe dysfunction.

A L-spine \nMRI obtained in the ED showed postoperative changes but no \nanatomical findings to account for her symptoms - notably, there \nwas no focal spinal compression.  The findings were unchanged \ncompared to past CT scan of the lumbar spine. \n    She was continued with her home regimen of acetaminophen and \noxycodone with good effect.  To ensure that there was no dynamic \ninstability of the spine, L-spine x-ray under ext\/flexion \nconditions were obtained.

She had a foley placed and \n>400 cc of urine was removed with the foley in place.  Urology \nwas contacted and the decision was to have her discharged home \nwith a foley catheter and to follow up with urology (per her \npreference - at the ___ Urological Associates) to perform \nurodynamic studies.  Other than the oxycodone (which she does \nnot take frequently), there was no identifiable medication to \ncause urinary retention. Given her past vaginal deliveries, she \nmay have structural etiologies for her retention.\n   She was found during this hospitalization to have a dirty \nU\/A: ___ large, Nit neg, RBC 6 WBC 30. Urine culture grew \n>100,000 ampicillin enterococcus.  She was initially treated \nwith ceftriaxone - and then switched to ampicillin IV and later \nPO augmenin (once the enterococcus was identified).  She will \ncomplete a 7 day course for complicated UTI.

A CT scan of your abdomen revealed colitis (inflammation of your colon). Your diarrhea improved significantly while you were in the hospital. Since we were unable to get a stool sample to test for specific bacteria, we were ultimately unable to diagnose the cause of your symptoms. However, we assume that these symptoms were due to an infectious colitis (i.e., infection of your large bowel), which was probably already resolving by the time you came to the hospital. We are treating this infection with a total of 3 days of antibiotics. You should take 4 additional doses of ciprofloxacin 500mg (dosed once in the morning and once at night) with the final dose on the morning of ___. For symptomatic treatment, we will give you a 5 day supply of pain medication (oxycodone)."}

He states that \nhe had chest pain after the syncopal episode however he stated \nthat this was secondary to CPR performed at parking office after \nhis syncopal event. Ishcemia is also unlikely given that he had \na stress test done on prior admission which was negative for \nischemia. The diagnosis was confirmed when the patient had two \nadditional syncopal episodes while in the presence of the \ninterventional pulmonary fellows who agreed that the patient \nwould need to be taken to the OR for stenting and debridment so \nthe patient does not have any further episodes of syncope.\n\nCough: The patient had a cough which is likely secondary to the \nSCC of the larynx that the patient has.

At time of admission to \n___, patient had HR in mid to high ___ with SBP 110-120.  His \nEKG showed no ischemic changes.  He was followed on telemetry \novernight and his cardiac enzymes were cycled.  Troponins were \nnegative x3. Telemetry showed sinus brady with rate 55-65.  On \nHD 1 patient intermittently complained of chest pain, a \nsensation of substernal \"squeezing\" as he described it.  EKGs \nwere repeated and all negative.  Due to concern of RCA ischemia, \na right-sided EKG was performed.  This showed no ischemic \nchanges.  Patient has no coronary risk factors; however, due to \nthe repeated episodes of chest pain not entirely suppressed by \nPPI and antacid therapy, and the 10 second pulseless arrest at \nOSH in response to NTG, there is concern of right-sided \nischemia.  He will schedule for outpatient exercise stress \ntesting.  He is discharged on baby aspirin daily.\n.\nChest pain symptoms were most consistent with GERD.  While in \nhouse patient was treated with omeprazole and Maalox.  He is \nbeing discharged on both meds.\n.\nA CXR performed in the ED was reviewed with radiology and there \nwas no sign of rib fracture.  Patient did intermittently \ncomplain of pleuritic type pain over his left chest (different \nin location and quality than the squeezing sensation described \nabove) likely ___ the chest compressions he received at OSH.\n..  \n# SYNCOPAL EPISODE:  The history was c\/w vasovagal syncope. \nTelemetry strip from OSH showed severe sinus bradycardia (HR 12) \nwith longest pause of 10 seconds.  As described above, there was \nconcern that NTG may have precipitated the sinus pause.  \nCardiology was consulted re: sinus arrest in setting of chest \npain and administration of a preload reducing agent.  They felt \nthat the sinus pause was most consistent with a severe vasovagal \nepisode (rather than right-sided ischemia).  Further history \nrevealed that patient had once collapsed in front of a judge \nduring a court case and that he had a history of getting woozy \naround blood draws.  To be sure there is no underlying coronary \nischemia, he will undergo stress testing as outpatient.\n..\n# H\/O ASTHMA:  he was treated with albuterol nebs prn.\n \nMedications on Admission:\nAcyclovir\n \nDischarge Medications:\n1.

KUB was notable for mildly dilated \nbowel loops but unremarkable for bowel perforation or \nobstruction. The patient was guaiac negative. Given the \npatient's vascular risk factors, ischemic colitis was initially \nsuspected. Lactate was 0.9. The patient was managed \nconservatively with bowel rest, IV fluids, high dose PPI, and \npain medication. An abdominal CT was performed and no evidence \nof bowel wall thickening or ischemic changes were apparent. \nGiven the patient's history of hemorrhoids, the patient's LGIB \nwas attributed to hemorrhoidal bleed or AVMs. The patient was \ndischarged with plans for followup with his outpatient \ngastroenterologist for possible flexible \nsigmoidoscopy\/colonoscopy.

At the time of admission your blood pressure and hematocrit levels were found to be normal and stable making a heavy bleed unlikely. An xray of your abdomen showed no bowel perforation but did show dilated bowel loops consistent with slowed bowel movement called an ileus. A CAT scan determined that you do not have any concerning problems with your bowel. You were treated with bowel rest, IV fluids, and pain medication. Given your history of an ulcer, you were also treated with a medication to reduce your stomach acid levels. Your symptoms improved with this regimen. We think you bleeding may have been due to abnormal blood vessels in your colon or hemorrhoids, and you will be scheduled to see a gastroenterologist within 14 days."}

He was previously treated with \nivermectin empirically and responded, with an eosonophil \ndifferential that fell from 40% to approximately 10%.  However, \nthere was concern that the patient's mass may have represented a \ncarcinoma, and hence he was scheduled for a repeat colonoscopy \nto definitely evaluate the mass.  Because of his AVR, he was \nadmitted for bridging, though he may have not required admission \ngiven that his valve is aortic as opposed to mitral, and because \nhe has few risk factors, other than his valve, for \nthromboembolism.  The colonoscopy was performed without \ncomplications and the patient was found to have complete \nresolution of the mass--it was completely absent.  Biopsies were \ntaken nonetheless.  The patient was empirically treated with \nanother two week course of ivermectin because his eosinophil \ndifferential was still elevated.  He will follow up with the GI \nand ID clinics.\n  \n# AVR:  Patient was bridged with heparin and warfarin was \nrestarted after the colonoscopy.  After uncovering AHA\/ACC data \nthat supports the notion that patients with AVR and few risk \nfactors do not need a heparin bridge, the patient was d\/c'd on \njust warfarin and not lovenox.

Initially, we thought this might be your heart, however it appears that this was due to the heart failure regimen that you were on being over-aggressive. We gave you some fluids which improved your symptoms, and adjusted your medications slightly in order to stop this from happening again. In particular, we believe that the furosemide (lasix) and metolazone, which are medications that help remove fluid from your body were at too high a dose. In order to stop this from happening again, you should weigh yourself every day in order to help manage your fluid status."}
